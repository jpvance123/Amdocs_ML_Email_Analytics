Steve-

This is the list that Kevin provided at his meeting on 11-17.  I have also 
included the matrix that Jim has compiled regarding each RTO's stance on 
these issues.  This matrix was made last week based primarily on FERC filings 
of 10-15.



I hope that this is helpful.

Joe, do you have a copy of the proposed RTO bylaws or what ever is 
available.  I appreciate the summary but would like to see what could be done 
to get a Board that is appointed independently also.

The Grid Florida (nee FLTRANSCO) RTO filing was completed today.  In order
to provide the documents to you more efficiently, we are making them
available for download on the Florida Transco website in a single zipped
file.  Within the file, you will find each of the individual documents
filed with the FERC in Adobe Acrobat format.  The Zip file is available on
the website homepage at: http://www.flatransco.com/  Individual files are
also available by clicking on the Filing Documents button at the same
location.

One of the files (Attachment P) is unusually large. It is only 15 pages
long, but nearly 3.8MB unzipped.  There are graphics in this file, but I
will be looking to see if we can improve the efficiency of this file also.
Please contact me if you have any problems with the files.

There were four major filings last week in the Midwest market.  These include the final compliance filings on rates, terms and conditions as well as the business plan for ARTO proposing National Grid as the Managing Member.  Attached are some ideas of the needed Enron responses - protests/comments and also very brief summaries of some of the filings.

We still can't get the Alliance filing made last Friday, not yet on the website or RIMS.  I will add to this when we get that filing and have time for a preliminary review.

The Midwest group will be initiating meetings to get further guidance on these possible protests/comments.

I spoke with Phil Harris today.

My key messages -

1. Commercial interest does not appear high on partnering / investing with 
PJM Technologies right now.  Doesn't mean that this is forever, but probably 
will want to gauge the markets reaction to your activities before .

2. We've drafted a Stipulation for Enron and PJM that gets most of Enron on 
board that I'm happy to send to your lawyers, but I want to be realistic 
about its chances of success -  

a)  appointment of a Settlement Judge (not Technical Staff) to oversee the 
consolidation process with quarterly updates and right to comment from all 
parties;
b) PJM will agree to modify its system including 1) FTR system, 2) eliminate 
ICAP obligation, and 3) discussion about central market making functions (day 
ahead markets).
c) a more specific obligation to move forward with the ability for Enron file 
at FERC on Nov.1.02 to repeal this status with PJM pre-approval on our filing 
(I went beyond the agreeing not to oppose such a filing).

He agreed with me that PJM wouldn't be able to sign.  We talked a little 
about a middle ground, but he and I did not see any real options.  

Given the time commitments for his lawyers, he is going to file something 
that would (a) agree to a Settlement Judge, (b) ask FERC not to predetermine 
any outcomes, especially a merger, and (c) don't hold his RTO hostage to our 
demands.

I think that given the Alliance RTO and GridSouth RTO language, he'll get his 
Order.

We agreed to keep talking.  I told him that we are trying to enter into 
discussions with the PA PUC about moving their market further ahead and I'd 
keep him in the loop.

He told me that he would be on C-SPAN this Wed am to discuss competition.  He 
really is a big believer in this market.

Finally, and most interestingly, he did not oppose the idea of minimizing the 
central market making functions of PJM.  He does not have a philosophy that 
the Sys Op must manage all of the markets (I specifically asked about Day 
Ahead).  He does see  a need for a workable solution that can shore up public 
confidence right now.  He would like to migrate to a more market driven 
environment in a reasonable timeframe.  He fully agrees that the market is 
better than a Sys Op in determining what happens - his limitations are 
technology and systems.  Ultimately the Sys Op should do nothing more than 
manage the network within the last 10 minute interval.

The tariff we are drafting for the e-Trans project its a "load pay" tariff.  
All the fixed costs are born by loads. Most of the capacity related anciallry 
services also wind up with load serving entities, i.e., regulation, requency 
response and operating reserves.  Our trading operations would system face 
congestion costs, losses and any mismatch between what they schedule and what 
is delivered (balancing).  

If you want to avoid real-time congestion costs, you can buy a Flowright and 
obtain forward price certianty.  We also provide for after the fact trading 
of imbalances as well.  Flowrights can be obtained in an auction or by 
initial allocation.  The initial allocations are phase out over four years 
once there is a history of congestion costs on which market participants can 
base auction bids.  All parties existing rights are converted to Flowrights 
so everyone is under the same tariff.  Access fees are paid by all to the RTO 
and used to pay the Transmission Owners for their revenue requirement.  
Service to native load becomes an explicit purchase under the tariff, not 
moving money from the left to the right pocket of a vertically integrated 
utility.

Subject: Re: First Draft of eTransMart FAQ's  

What does this proposal imply about transmission pricing.  We have debated 
from time-to-time whether we would be better off with a pure "loads pay" 
transmission pricing scheme because it would leave fewer places for utilities 
to hide the ball (when they pay for transmission they are just transferring 
money from one pocket to the other) and it would allow us to reach the 
maximum number of counterparties for each MW (thereby increasing liquidity).  
Where do we stand?

These questsions seem to be focus on the modularity of the product.  This is 
fine from the vendors' perspectives, however, from a Tariff perspective, it 
hints at conceding to others' tariiffs/structures.  There should be a few 
questions that paint the entire Real Flow solution - even referencing that a 
tariff is available.

Also, can I assume the entities listed are endorsing eTransMart?  Or do they 
not even know their name is referenced here?

With the first round of RTO filings and responses complete, it is a good time 
to step back and review the highs and lows that occurred in 2000 and lay out 
our plan going into 2001. 

A. 2000 Key Facts --

1. FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS.

It does not appear that FERC (in its current form) will modify its standing 
policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let 1,000 
flowers bloom.  While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a 
different position, we have seen no signals that anything will change.  Faced 
with this policy, as the initial RTO filings made clear, almost all utilities 
are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic 
transmission assets.  Accordingly, most of the proposed RTOs do not remove 
the fundamental problem - the Native Load exception.

2. THE MIDWEST CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST.

The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO.  The three big 
utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd, 
IP, and Ameren (probably 40% of total load in initial MISO).   Key problems 
for the MISO include (a) MISO's not-for-profit status (key IP claim), (b) 
parties interest in taking energy east (key ComEd need), and (c) fair 
retention of 3rd party wheeling revenues (Ameren want).    Meetings with 
regional stakeholders (public power, industrials, State PUCs) have been 
productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred 
option, however we await action from the FERC.  MISO is also telling everyone 
that can listen that if the big three pull out, it probably won't continue.  
While the MISO process is very open to the public (not so with the Alliance 
RTO), neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the 
details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met.

3. SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED - NOTHING.

Rather than take a major step forward, Southern and Grid South (SCANA, CP&L, 
Duke) have initially filed non-compliant RTOs.  Grid South does nothing to 
advance a market, much less provide transmission service in a 
non-discriminatory fashion.  In fact, Grid South simply takes the current 888 
OATT and "combines" the three utilities for wheeling through purposes.  

4. PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERC'S SHINING LIGHT.

PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was 
necessary (rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the "right 
example").  PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order 2000 in 
that filing.  PJM is also expanding.  So far, Allegheny Power and DQE have 
agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called 
PJM West.  In terms of market coordination, PJM has been publicly reluctant 
to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools (PJM, 
NYISO,  NE-ISO, and Ontario IMO).   The other pools are not getting very much 
accomplished in their efforts.  For example, NE-ISO has indicated that it 
won't have the Day-Ahead market ready until 2003 at the earliest.  

5. ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME.

ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail 
access (pilot program beginning next summer).  The rules are still being 
structured.  We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines don't 
overwhelm good market structure.   Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading 
our efforts and are very active.  

6. SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG

In a surprise move, the actions so far in Grid Florida, while certainly not 
perfect, appear to be moving in the right direction.  The FL PSC has gone 
from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right.  
Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during 
this Legislative session; Enron will be involved.

B. 2001 Steps - 

1. FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION.

FERC will have new leadership some time in early 2000 (if we can get a 
President).  Enron is developing a coordinated political plan (Capitol Hill, 
media, Administration, industry allies) to impress upon the next 
Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue 
to drive wholesale market reforms.  Without a stronger mandate, it may prove 
difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of 2001.  More importantly, it 
will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail 
wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight.  In those RTOs 
that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception, no 
amount of meetings or filings will change the parties.

2. COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK.

It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to 
ensure that Enron's objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs.  
The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to 
coordinate day-to-day activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no 
opportunity is missed.  This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs 
of the commercial teams.   We continue to have at least one person dedicated 
to each RTO market.

NYISO   -  Howard Fromer
NE-ISO  -  Dan Allegretti
IMO   - Aleck Dadson
PJM  - Tom Hoatson
MISO/Alliance - Jeff Brown / Dave Mangskau
Grid South - Tom Chapman / Joe Connor
Southern  - Joe Connor
Florida  - Dan Staines
SPP  - Ron McNamara
ERCOT  - Robin Kittel

Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out.  
Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June / July to also work on wholesale 
market issues.

3. PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS.

NE-ISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January 
15, 2001.  While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration 
matters, not much progress has been made to date.  Moving power between the 
pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling 
rules.  FERC is aware of these problems.  Again, FERC has not done anything 
to mandate compliance with Order 2000.  We have deployed an additional 
resource in Houston recently to help support Enron's involvement in the tight 
pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all 
developments as close to real-time as possible.

4. CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES.

The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for 
ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO.  We continue to 
advocate our agenda (to anyone that will listen).   This work is time 
consuming (much spent listening to "junk" from monopolist Transmission 
Owners) and detailed.  Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs 
initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our 
resources.

5. FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT e-trans.

Project e-trans has resulted in a new business consortium - 
etransconsortium.com.  This combination of APX, Cal PX, and Alstom ESCA has 
developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the "market 
front-end" for any RTO (e.g., day-ahead market, transmission exchange, 
etc.).  Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates 
our policy objectives.  We are now turning our attention to finding the right 
Grid Operator.  We are in discussions with National Grid, American 
Transmission Company, MISO, and PJM (although they may want to do something 
very similar).  The goal remains the same -- to have a fully functioning 
entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use 
this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action.  I will be taking 
a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in 2001.

6. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION 
DIVESTITURE

Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets 
through direct access and divestiture.  It will take (1) non-discriminatory 
transmission access, (2) retail choice, and (3) generation divestiture to 
enable a fully thriving wholesale market.  Of course, additional market 
openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California.

I hope this helps put some framework around our activities.  If anyone wants 
to discuss this in more detail, I'd be happy to meet individually or as a 
group.

Jim

Northeast RTO Mediation Report

The Commissioners heard a report from the ALJ who presided over the Northea=
st RTO mediation.  As you may recall, the Judge did not support our positio=
n (which was to get a single Northeast RTO up and running, with PJM leaders=
hip and based on the PJM system) by no later than November 2003 (the PJM pr=
oposal).  As expected, the Judge reiterated his disagreement with the PJM p=
roposal and urged the Commission to take a "go slower" approach that includ=
es a minimum 12 month up-front assessment of technology and "best practices=
" determinations. =20

Pat Wood first questioned why the Board makeup should consist of existing I=
SO board members.  He acknowledged that the existing ISO board members have=
 experience but questioned whether the benefit of having their experience i=
s outweighed by the possibility of continued parochial interests that may b=
e retained by these board members.  He thinks perhaps the board should be m=
ade up of totally new board members.  Ironically, in the mediation only a c=
ouple of consumer advocate-types supported this type of approach.  Everyone=
 else believed that using the existin ISO board members makes more sense si=
nce they all have experience.  We supported a board makeup weighted in favo=
r of PJM so that implementation of the PJM system would be assured.  Pat se=
ems to think this presents too much of a political problem.

Pat also expressed concern that FERC not take action that would upset the e=
xisting, functioning markets.  He said FERC should not force a result if it=
 does not know what the outcome will be and could disrupt the existing mark=
ets.  He questioned whether they should take a different, slower approach i=
n the northeast, perhaps putting some regional functions into place soon (e=
.g., interregional transmission planning and expansion) and put off other i=
ssues (a single real time balancing market) that may be harder to implement=
 at first.  Pat says that technology assessment is a big issue and can be a=
 show stopper if it is not done correctly.  Under the PJM proposal, the new=
 RTO would form by the end of the year and would start market design (based=
 on the PJM system) immediately.  Doing an upfront assesment could delay im=
plementation significantly.  He said perhaps some things can be done sooner=
 than 18-24 months.  If he is thinking that long-term is 18-24 months, then=
 we could be okay because the PJM plan takes 24 months to implement.  But, =
his statements on technical assessment are troubling and sound like he may =
be willing to delay the startup of market design until this takes place.

On the positive side, Nora Brownell reminded everyone that New York and PJM=
 have very similar systems but they have a lot of problems working together=
 and that these problems may be a hindrance to the developing retail market=
s.  She seems to think that things cannot remain as they are.

Nothing was decided and it is unclear when FERC will issue an order in this=
 proceeding.  We will keep you posted.

Yep, you are still a junkie and the first to ask for these.       

This next one RT01-100 is the ALJ order setting the mediation settlement conference, starting Tuesday, July 17.

 RTO Week

Day 3 -- October 17, 2001

Standardizing RTO Tariffs

The morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  

The panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.

General Observations

This panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an "as available" basis.   The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.

I am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.

What Services Should be Standardized?

Overall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  

XCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  

Should FERC Retain CBM?

Ricky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.

Network Versus Point to Point Service

Peter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  

Should all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?

Most of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.

What Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?

Jim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize "as available" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.

Ray Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Participants:

-Prof. Charles Cicchetti, Univ. of Southern California
-Comm. Robert Nelson, Mich. Pub. Serv. Comm.
-Marji Phillips, Exelon Power Team (attorney)
-Sonny Popowski, PA Office of Consumer Advocate
-Craig Roach, Boston Pacific
-Anjali Sheffrin, Dir. Market Analysis, Cal ISO

Summary:  Market Monitor (MM) should be independent.  Too much MM transparency is a problem -- MM function should be done privately to FERC.  MM should be an early warning signal.

Specifics:
The morning started on a rather humorous note with Marji Phillips introducing herself as "the guilty party so to speak in front of you" (referencing the PECO/Exelon purported violation of standards of conduct).  She stated that it is not the role of the MM to interfere to make sure that power prices are the lowest in each hour -- the MM should monitor the RTO and the markets and be part of a creative solution (without imposing its own MM penalties/mitigation).  She used the Midwest price spikes of 98 as an example, and stated that a poor MM would probably have worsened the market solution that was reached without intervention.

Most of the group agreed with Prof. Cicchetti that the MM should not be the policeman, judge and jury.  He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).  As Craig Roach said, the MM should look at more than market power -- it should also look at market conditions and market rules and be a vehicle for innovation.  Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not "go to the farmer for costs."  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.  

Many thought that there should be some standardization of the information provided to the MM.  Most agreed that the information should be provided on a confidential basis, especially before any specific problem has been found.

Sonny Popowski stated that the RTO must be truly independent or the MM simply catalogs the market failures.

Comm. Nelson said that the MM should have unfettered access to all costs and should have the ability for "cease and desist" orders.  Also, stated that ITCs/transcos should be monitored to the extent that they favor transmission solutions over DG and generation.  On the very positive side, he said RTO policy should proceed.

Ms. Sheffrin said that it would be simple to implement a rolling 12 month cost plus 10% competitive benchmark, and prices above this should be mitigated.  She said this would allow bidders to "self police" so as to not hit the benchmark.  Most of the others disagreed with her, pointing out that a simplistic test such as this does not account for market conditions.  It was pointed out that there were too many different MMs in Cal with no one acting.  Someone also commented that one reason participants did not want to turn data over to Cal ISO was because it was a contesting party.

All thought that DSM should be included in the market in order to be considered in mitigation.

Comm. Breathitt asked Ms. Sheffrin why the price cap wouldn't work in Cal.  She responded that the problems in Cal were with the need for LT contracts and other issues (she also said that it is not a zonal/lmp issue).  Importantly, she said that consumers are now conserving 3000-5000 MWs annually since getting the appropriate price signals.  Mr. Popowski said that he likes the price caps in PJM.  Margie countered and said that "icap" in PJM is the problem.  

FERC staff asked if the MM should monitor bilaterals.  Marji said absolutely not (between consenting companies and should not be unraveled).  Both agreed that the MM may at times need access to these in order to understand what was happening in the spot market.

This is the pleading that we filed yesterday in the Midwest proceedings - both Alliance RTO and Midwest ISO as well as National Grid.  We ask the FERC to take immediate action giving specific guidance on the RTO structure based on the SE mediation report by the ALJ (governance, stakeholder process and congestion management using LMP).  After such guidance we suggest that the order require a collaborative process of all parties to work out the details.

Jim Steffes asked me to develop some talking points for your meeting with Ed 
Holland on June 6.   Attached is a short list of talking points that cover 
the high level issues we have with Southern at this point and some key 
questions we would like answered.  

I have also attached a background paper on the key Southern personnel we deal 
with on the RTO, including Ed Holland.  This paper also discusses some of the 
major positions Southern has taken that you should be aware of for your 
meeting.

In addition, I have attached a chronology of the SE Trans development that 
gives you a quick overview of the major steps that have taken place, 
including those in starting a collaborative group for both SE Trans and 
GridSouth.

When Ed requested the meeting with you, he knew I was discussing a meeting 
between Enron and two of his key executives concerning the SE Trans 
development.  My best guess is that he is coming to see you about the 
activities of the collaborative group we are working with.

I am sure I have told you more about Southern than you wanted to know, but If 
you have any questions about this information or would like to discuss any of 
it, please call me (205-516-4591).

Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just let us know.

FERC Approves NEPOOL's Three-Part Bids

On April 25, FERC approved NEPOOL=01,s proposal to implement a system where=
=20
generators can submit three-part supply offers consisting of a start-up=20
price, an hourly no-load price, and an incremental energy price.  NEPOOL al=
so=20
proposed that when a supplier=01,s total revenues over a day from the energ=
y and=20
operating reserves markets were less than its total bid costs, the shortfal=
l=20
would be paid to the supplier as net commitment period compensation (NCPC)=
=20
uplift.  There was disagreement within NEPOOL as to who will pay these upli=
ft=20
costs.

In approving NEPOOL=01,s three-part bid system, FERC finds that the system =
is=20
consistent with the policies in place in New York and PJM.  With regard to=
=20
NCPC uplift cost allocation, FERC finds that NEPOOL=01,s exiting method of=
=20
allocating NCPC uplift costs broadly, based on electrical load, is=20
appropriate since it is difficult to determine who causes what amount of=20
uplift costs.  The new three-part bid system will take effect July 1, 2001.

FERC Rejects Proposal to Disclose Bidding Information

In an April 13 FERC order of no overall interest to us, FERC includes a=20
discussion about the rules for disclosure of bidding and other data gathere=
d=20
by the ISO.  Braintree had argued that FERC should require public disclosur=
e=20
of bidding and other data in order to allow NEPOOL participants to monitor=
=20
the actions of others.  FERC rejected Braintree=01,s arguments, finding tha=
t=20
FERC=01,s rules strike an appropriate balance between the need to disclose =
as=20
much information as possible and the desire to avoid disclosure requirement=
s=20
that will make it more difficult for the ISO to obtain information from=20
market participants in the first place.  FERC states that because data=20
collection is critical to the ISO=01,s ability to monitor the NEPOOL market=
s, it=20
does not want to take action that would impede the ISO=01,s ability to coll=
ect=20
this information.

Information Policy

NEPOOL submitted a March 5, 2001 request for revisions to NEPOOL=01,s=20
Information Policy, to be effective May 5, 2001, which permits FERC to obta=
in=20
NEPOOL Participant confidential information directly from ISO-NE.  On April=
=20
25, 2001, FERC issued an order approving the filing.  FERC stated that ISO-=
NE=20
should be able to turn over confidential information to FERC without first=
=20
being required to notify the affected member of receipt of a request for=20
information.  However, the Commission notes that the information given to=
=20
FERC will be treated confidentially by FERC until FERC rules otherwise, and=
=20
those Participants' whose information is given to FERC will retain the=20
opportunity to oppose release of that information to the general public=20
before FERC makes the information public.

Market Monitor Information Collection

ISO filed revised procedures intended to give ISO the authority to monitor=
=20
for generator physical and economic withholding as a way to raise prices. =
=20
Under the revised procedures, a reference price is calculated for each 10MW=
=20
block for each generating unit.  The specific reference price is an average=
=20
of in-merit bids over the last 30 days.  ISO will investigate all bids that=
=20
deviate significantly from the reference price. =20

Under the ISO's proposed procedures, prospective mitigation will occur if I=
SO=20
determines that the bid will have a significant effect on the relevant mark=
et=20
clearing price or uplift payment and the generator cannot adequately justif=
y=20
why its bid is not anti-competitive.  If a bid is mitigated, ISO will=20
substitute the generator=01,s reference price as its default bid.  ISO will=
=20
implement these new mitigation measures on July 1.  ISO also proposed to=20
release bid data after a 3 months delay (FERC previously ordered ISO to=20
release bid data after a 6 month delay).

Many generators opposed the procedures; Braintree argued they do not go far=
=20
enough.  On April 26, FERC accepted ISO=01,s changes, finding that they do =
not=20
give ISO too much discretion and are consistent with NYISO mitigation=20
procedures.  FERC rejected ISO=01,s proposal to release data 3 months=20
after-the-fact and directed ISO to wait 6 months before release.

uplift.  There was disagreement within NEPOOL as to who will pay these upli=
ft=20
costs.

In approving NEPOOL=01,s three-part bid system, FERC finds that the system =
is=20
consistent with the policies in place in New York and PJM.  With regard to=
=20
NCPC uplift cost allocation, FERC finds that NEPOOL=01,s exiting method of=

allocating NCPC uplift costs broadly, based on electrical load, is=20
appropriate since it is difficult to determine who causes what amount of=20
uplift costs.  The new three-part bid system will take effect July 1, 2001.

FERC Rejects Proposal to Disclose Bidding Information

In an April 13 FERC order of no overall interest to us, FERC includes a=20
discussion about the rules for disclosure of bidding and other data gathere=
d=20
by the ISO.  Braintree had argued that FERC should require public disclosur=
e=20
of bidding and other data in order to allow NEPOOL participants to monitor=
=20
the actions of others.  FERC rejected Braintree=01,s arguments, finding tha=
t=20
FERC=01,s rules strike an appropriate balance between the need to disclose =
as=20
much information as possible and the desire to avoid disclosure requirement=
s=20
that will make it more difficult for the ISO to obtain information from=20
market participants in the first place.  FERC states that because data=20
collection is critical to the ISO=01,s ability to monitor the NEPOOL market=
s, it=20
does not want to take action that would impede the ISO=01,s ability to coll=
ect=20
this information.

Information Policy

NEPOOL submitted a March 5, 2001 request for revisions to NEPOOL=01,s=20
Information Policy, to be effective May 5, 2001, which permits FERC to obta=
in=20
NEPOOL Participant confidential information directly from ISO-NE.  On April=
=20
25, 2001, FERC issued an order approving the filing.  FERC stated that ISO-=
NE=20
should be able to turn over confidential information to FERC without first=
=20
being required to notify the affected member of receipt of a request for=20
information.  However, the Commission notes that the information given to=
=20
FERC will be treated confidentially by FERC until FERC rules otherwise, and=
=20
those Participants' whose information is given to FERC will retain the=20
opportunity to oppose release of that information to the general public=20
before FERC makes the information public.

Market Monitor Information Collection

ISO filed revised procedures intended to give ISO the authority to monitor=
=20
for generator physical and economic withholding as a way to raise prices. =
=20
Under the revised procedures, a reference price is calculated for each 10MW=
=20
block for each generating unit.  The specific reference price is an average=
=20
of in-merit bids over the last 30 days.  ISO will investigate all bids that=
=20
deviate significantly from the reference price. =20

Under the ISO's proposed procedures, prospective mitigation will occur if I=
SO=20
determines that the bid will have a significant effect on the relevant mark=
et=20
clearing price or uplift payment and the generator cannot adequately justif=
y=20
why its bid is not anti-competitive.  If a bid is mitigated, ISO will=20
substitute the generator=01,s reference price as its default bid.  ISO will=
=20
implement these new mitigation measures on July 1.  ISO also proposed to=20
release bid data after a 3 months delay (FERC previously ordered ISO to=20
release bid data after a 6 month delay).

Many generators opposed the procedures; Braintree argued they do not go far=
=20
enough.  On April 26, FERC accepted ISO=01,s changes, finding that they do =
not=20
give ISO too much discretion and are consistent with NYISO mitigation=20
procedures.  FERC rejected ISO=01,s proposal to release data 3 months=20
after-the-fact and directed ISO to wait 6 months before release.

Steve - I put together the following draft slide for next week's analyst conference regarding RTO's.  Could you take a minute to review and let me know if you have any comments/concerns.

I can be reached at x34785 or via e-mail.

Thanks.

(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition 
market based rates on RTO participation.

GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the "voluntary" nature 
of Order No. 2000.
Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is 
premature due to Southern's "significant progress" in developing an RTO.  
Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating 
that the Investigation is based on "perception," not fact, and contains 
conclusions that are "ill-formed."  Southern concludes that the "Southeastern 
bulk power market worked quite well" this summer because there were no price 
spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge 
stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first.

(2)  GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO 
filing in abeyance:

Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day 
period.  It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and 
additional guidance from the Commission during that period.  GridSouth will 
provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the 
conclusion of the this period.  

(3)  Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order 
request that it can be an RTO

States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about 
spin off of transmission assets.  Southern would still like to have separate 
transmission company (Jim S. is looking into an Etrans opportunity with this.)

(4)  GridSouth response to protests

It contains alot of responses to Santee Cooper's protest about the ownership 
structure of the LLC
GridSouth argues that its expansion possibilities are limited by TVA to the 
West and VEPCO to the north (note: Grid South states that VEPCO joined 
Alliance because it is subject to the Virginia Electric Utility Restucturing 
Act that requires all suppliers to have access to the electric transmission 
system by 1/1/01 and retail choice by 1/1/02.  Any insights on this thinking 
by Grid South would be helpful.  Will all of VEPCO native load be under an 
OATT?)
Grid South will file interconnection procedures by 2/01.

With the move to RTO configurations, are you interested in seeing this report 
based on electric's RTO affiliations, still listing activity by electric but 
designated under RTO affiliation?  If so, there would no longer be a 
separation between EAST and WEST.  Please advise if you are interested.  (The 
report can remain as is, as you wish).

Attached is the Weekly Electric Report for week ending November 24.

The October 16 Southern RTO filing is finally up on its website at 
www.southernco.com.  Look at the RTO documents and presentations.  They have 
filed it as a petition for declaratory order asking that the Commission 
approve their Gridco structure and rate proposal.  I did talk with FERC staff 
yesterday when the filing was not on the web and told them that Southern was 
the last to get their proposal up on the web.

I don't have what Southern filed.  I understand the filing will be on 
Southern's web page (www.southernco.com) within a couple of days.  I'm in 
Virginia at the SERC Joint Committee Meeting and won't get the filings until 
I get home Friday night.

As for an independent Board, as long as Southern owns the transmission assets 
as it does in the proposed for-profit Gridco, there is about zero possibility 
of them agreeing to have no say in the selection of the Board or in setting 
the incentive plan.  What specifically are you concerned about (the selection 
process or the incentive plan or both)?  I think we have a shot at getting 
them to consider changing the setting of the incentive plan to let the Board 
do it, as long as it is restricted such that it cannot impact the value of 
the assets.  Any thoughts?

Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P=
ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation.=20
=20
** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo=
del (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remainin=
g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process.  Ho=
wever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de=
termination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a =
platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  =
There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should enc=
ourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by t=
he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER=
C orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down=
).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m=
odel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit =
a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that pa=
rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco=
mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc=
tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission=
 will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he=
r recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission=
 would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t=
ype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg=
ested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of=
 the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde=
r participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  Wh=
ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not ad=
opt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day =
2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).
=20
The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the G=
rid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (with=
out any changes).  Clearly, our response FERC will include our proposed cha=
nges to the documents.  Highlights from her report below:

She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest=20
She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr=
ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input, r=
egardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC=20
Her opinion is that the "Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s=
ponsored) Model" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion managemen=
t) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements=
 of Order No. 2000 based on a "best practices" analysis of other RTOs and C=
ommission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid =
model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, et=
al.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) =
in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model i=
s not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid phy=
sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a=
nd LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsib=
ilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below:=20
Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and =
an enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was a=
dded to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission ow=
ner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission =
solutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would a=
dminister the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission=
 system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and tra=
nsmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She str=
ongly encourages this split.=20
Good stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) =
and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets=20
Allows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), wi=
th RTO oversight=20
Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control=
 areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pur=
suant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.  Recognizes that con=
solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures.  (Protocols should be=
 subject to further discussion)=20
RTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including=
 rate changes and tariff filings=20
All load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has=
 appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their =
rights should they win on appeal)=20
4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and G=
ridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant t=
ransmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existin=
g facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those abo=
ve).  There will be one "through and out rate", plus a Grid Management Char=
ge for RTO operation.=20
Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT=20
Financial Rights/LMP (includes "real time spot market") is clearly the pref=
erred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many =
details need to be worked out in continued discussions.  Model allows parti=
es to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges (FCH). =
 Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation, auction and =
non-discriminatory release.  The Grid model includes a "balancing resource"=
 requirement that we will provide comments against=20
Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be=
 supported -- control area operators required to provide before such market=
 establishment=20
RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC=20
RTO/transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder=
 process=20
Numerous comments from marketers, IPPs on reduction of control area functio=
ns (all of our comments from last week's response are included)=20
Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many a=
re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a "cost-benefit" analysis an=
d had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to=
 the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the "economies of s=
cale" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure. =
 In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process=
 that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shiftin=
g:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo=
wed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t=
ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a=
ssets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re=
tail open access (concerns with Cal.)  Judge encourages the Commission to u=
tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners=
.

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the =
extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant "jump sta=
rt" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud=
ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions.  Furthermore, the in=
itial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a "b=
est practices" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L=
MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b=
oard structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant=
 stakeholder advisory process.  The Commission should consider utilize the =
fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions, or, at a mini=
mum, consider similar mediated "jump starts."=20

Subject: SE RTO protest w/ press info.

Dan--  Please put the attachment into filing format in order to make a filing 
in each of the current RTOs this Thursday 11/16.  Then, our detailed protests 
will be made on Monday 11/20, as planned.

Mark Palmer asked that you forward the Thursday filings to your press 
contacts with a statement that unless properly structured, the RTO filings 
could end up being "Really Terrible Options."

Also, we will decide probably Friday or Monday on whether we file this 
attachment in FPL's current request for market based rates continuation, 
Docket ER97-3359-003 due Monday 11/20, so please prepare that filing.

We can also file the attachment in Ameren when FERC notices Ameren's recent 
request to quit MISO to join Alliance (rather than filing in Ameren Docket 
No. ER00-2687 as a request for rehearing (due 12/1)).  Thanks.

Subject: FPL and the SE RTO protests

Attached is the proposed protest that EPMI would file next Monday 11/20 
against FPL in its request for continuation of market based rates for its 
wholesale merchant function and affiliates.  EPMI has already filed detailed 
protests (unlike the attached generic protest) against AEP, Entergy and 
Southern due to problems with each utility's OASIS system.  EPMI plans to 
file this generic protest in other large vertically integrated utility 
requests for continuation of market based rates.  The attachment now includes 
a reference to Staff's investigation that states participation in an RTO, 
without the proper safeguards, including the elimination of the native load 
exception, will not necessarily reduce the utilities' ability to discriminate 
against third parties.  Plus, there is a reference that Staff found a 
perception that the SE is the worst area for discriminatory practices.

Please let me know if you have an issue with EPMI making this filing in FPL's 
proceeding.

Also, note:  EPMI plans to file this generic protest this Thursday in the 
current RTO proposals -- SPP, Entergy transco, Florida RTO, Southern, Grid 
south.  Then on Monday 11/20, EPMI will be filing its specific protests of 
other aspects of each RTO filing.

SK - I forwarded this to the group too.  mm 

The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we 
expected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to 
satisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The 
Commission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and 
its neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and 
configuration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a 
lack of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they 
failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or 
what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order 
states that the Commission favors the development of large, regional 
transmission organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission 
indicates that they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the 
order requires the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in 
settlement discussions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these 
meetings will start next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope 
characteristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach 
to focus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The 
order states, "We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in 
the Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible."  
The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may be 
more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market 
development, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower 
wholesale electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the 
mediation as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is 
starting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other 
aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion 
managment, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, 
I am attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the 
order is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs 
are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  
Therefore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and 
file a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

Enron Asks US FERC To Link Mkt-Based Pwr Rates With RTOs

11/20/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Power Marketing Inc. is urging federal 
regulators to withdraw the authority of several electric utilities in the 
U.S. Southeast to sell power at market rates if they fail to join an approved 
independent grid-asset operator by Dec. 15, 2001. 
The Enron Corp. (ENE) power-marketing unit made the suggestion in filings 
Friday in response to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 
December 1999 order encouraging U.S. utilities to turn their high-voltage 
transmission assets over to independent control of regional transmission 
organizations, or RTOs.
The filing came the same day that FERC Commissioner William Massey told a 
gathering of energy lawyers that he would seek to ensure that FERC - on a 
generic, national basis - makes preservation of market-based sales authority 
by utilities contingent upon their joining an FERC-approved RTO. 
Enron limited the applicability of its filing to RTO proposals from utilities 
in the U.S. Southeast: Carolina Power & Light Co. (CPL), Duke Energy Corp. 
(DUK), Florida Power Corp. (FPC), Florida Power & Light Co. (FPL), South 
Carolina Electric & Gas Co. (SCG), Southern Co. (SO). Tampa Electric Co. (TE) 
and the Southwest Power Pool Inc. 
Absent participation in a FERC-approved RTO, "there is no basis for the 
commission to assume that a transmission owner has mitigated its transmission 
market power and ability to discriminate against its transmission-dependent 
competitors," Enron said in its filing. 
Enron noted that FERC called for creation of RTOs after determining that its 
landmark 1996 rules requiring open-access transmission services weren't 
enough to assure that vertically integrated utilities couldn't control their 
transmission assets to financial gain in competitive wholesale power markets. 
"The commission has repeatedly recognized that vertically integrated 
transmission system owners have an inherent incentive to use their 
transmission monopolies to discriminate in favor of their own and affiliated 
power merchant activities," Enron said. 
The Houston energy giant noted that FERC staff, in a report detailing 
findings of a national investigation of problems affecting competitive 
wholesale power markets nationally, found that market participants in the 
Southeastern U.S. have less confidence than market participants in other 
regions of the country that their transactions won't be subject to 
discriminatory practices. 
"Selling power at market-based (as opposed to cost-based) rates is not a 
right, but rather a privilege enjoyed by sellers that can demonstrate that 
they are price takers, unable to exercise market power," Enron said. 
"Any vertically integrated transmission monopoly that stops short of taking 
every step that the commission identifies as needed to abate market power and 
root out discrimination should be denied the privilege of selling power at 
market-based rates. It simply cannot be trusted not to abuse the privilege," 
Enron said.

Subject:	Re: Southern  RTO   

I would guess that AEC has had a change of heart - since they signed the MOU with Southern.  I would expect them to withdraw their comments.  I will talk to Jeff Parrish at AEC and find out what's going on.

I talked to Bob Reilley about the EPSA filing.  He made it sound like it had just been forgotten in the rush and he didn't seem to have a clear idea about what EPSA should say in a filing.  That's funny since he drafted the original document we started talking from.  Anyway, we discussed it again and he agreed to get back to EPSA and discuss a filing.  The topics would be:
(1) MOUs don't mean much
(2) No real progress has been shown
(3) FERC need to oversee the process
(4) FERC needs to ensure a collaborative process is implemented
I didn't tell Bob that Enron wants to stay out of it, but we talked about it being better to have EPSA carry the ball when we first started looking at this.  I think your bringing it up in the EPSA phone call will help.  Let me know if it looks like Bob is not following up with EPSA.

Joe, I agree with the approach that we should try to get EPSA to file.  I have spoken with Mark Bennett over at EPSA and he indicated that he hadn't gotten to it.  Perhaps I should bring it up on the EPSA call this Thursday, just a gentle reminder.

AEC was the culprit who commented on June 22.  They were extremely negative about Southern's lack of results in their "attempt" to increase participation in the RTO.  They said, "Southern suggests no more than the possibility of another paper 'RTO proposal' by December 15, 2001."  They do ask for a technical conference by FERC staff and then a settlement judge proceeding thereafter.

I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday.  They talked about what is going on with the non-jurisdictional utilities that have signed a MOU to develop a RTO.  The group has met a couple of times to discuss the process they will use.  Confidentiality agreements have been signed, so no details are available, but they have agreed to a voting structure for the development.  Southern has about one third of the votes (and 65%of the assets) and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to carry a vote.  Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other parties that Southern was not going to run, or dominate, the process.  After that, Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for the development.  

They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the RTO work and resolve the hurdles the non-jurisdictional utilities have been expressing with the development of other RTOs.  They said there were some rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldn't be sure agreement would be reached, but at this point there was a lot of cooperation. 

Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete RTO filing could be ready by 12/15/01.  They also said they thought this is what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean.  

We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development.  They said that it was too early to make any commitment, but the group had started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available by late summer. 
They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise the development group as early as possible.  They said they understood the difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial filing and wanted to do it different, but they pointed out again that Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group.  In the meantime, they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or other members of the development group.

Jim, I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and Steve Kean, and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come.  I don't think they want to discuss anything technical at this point; they just want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area, and they want any help we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run.  

I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southern's May 15th status report, either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority ( Donna, I guess that's who you meant in the memo below, since AEC has signed a MOU with Southern?).  I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we haven't heard from EPSA on its filing.  I still think that's the best approach.

I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its RT01-77 on June 20.  They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp, Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO.  These are really general, more of the same of what we've seen from Southern.

Also we had talked  about possible comments on the May 15 Southern filing; Coral was working on comments through EPSA.  Nothing has been filed by EPSA yet.  

Alabama did file comments on the May 15 status report and they have asked that the FERC establish a technical conference to "publicly air and evaluate the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant delay..."  Following a technical conference, they ask for a judge to convene a settlement conference at FERC to "undertake a properly supervised and serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time."

At this point we could consider filing comments in support of the Coop comments.

Attached is the starting point for our discussion tomorrow morning.  A few things to keep in the back of your mind as you look at this:  

(1)	We don't think we're going to end up with a settlement in this case.  So, we need to design our presentation to include the evidence necessary for the OPUC to rule in our favor.  The rate plan is a complete plan because we need to present a showing of benefits to get the transaction approved.

(2)	PGE and NWN already have in place mechanisms that will automatically pass through the benefits of any savings in (a) generation costs--even if its A&G that gets allocated to generation; and (b) gas costs.  If we do nothing with respect to these cost categories, we will face a fight to keep the synergies every year.  

(3)	The proposal has a number of bells & whistles.  We may want to think of the proposal as a menu of "rate benefits" we can offer.  Take one from column A and one from column B, etc.

Subject: Summary of RTO Week -- Day One


Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues from both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

All commissioners were present.  Shelton Cannon was the moderator and facilitator.  Purpose is to have intensive discussion to develop FERC guidance.  Focus is on functions rather than characteristics - what should and should not be standardized?

 Midwest Commissioners' Presentation

Several Midwest commissioners were invited to make an opening statement.  David Svanda, Michigan PSC, made the comments.  He said Midwest state regulators believe there are arbitrary boundaries between ARTO and MISO.  State regulators worked hard on the settlement that includes single rate and IRCA.  MISO and ARTO have not resolved critical issues and now there needs significant bolstering of the IRAC effort.  Would like to work with FERC on details of Midwest issues.  They propose to create a Joint Board between FERC and State Regulators, pursuant to section 209 of the FPA, to formalize a FERC/midwest partnership.  <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Although this was an issue to be discussed by the second panel, the issue was raised in the first panel when the discussion centered on ancillary services.  Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

Standardized Markets

Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Breathitt asked whether there could be an entirely bilateral market with no mandatory balancing market.  All of the panelists agreed that you must have a real time energy market even with bilateral contracts.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet, the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

ICAP

Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Brownell said she thinks the ICAP debate is one that needs to be resolved now, before RTOs are put in place.  She wonders whether ICAP requirements are needed in the interim until RTOs, with working markets, are up and running.  Not many of the panelists agreed with this, saying temporary ICAP requirements will not send the needed signals to build.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?

Steve Naumann said he assumes two Midwest RTOs, but most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Midwest Commissioners' Proposal to Have a Joint Board

Massey asked all the panelists what they thought of this idea.  None of the panelists, even the Connecticut commissioner, thought this was a good idea, citing the inevitable disagreements and problems that will arise, and the risk that such a Board could slow down progress.

 

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussed congestion management.  The panelists were:  Na=
ncy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; C=
arol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkl=
ey and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Gro=
up.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system is not going to change =
in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Opening Statements

Nancy Brockway:  focus on two topics:  1) flowgate vs. LMP; and 2) relation=
ship between congestion management (CM) and resource planning.  She support=
s LMP and standard market design in New England.  Flowgate rights are cumbe=
rsome, create unnecessary uplift costs - freezing power distribution factor=
s is bad and could result in some free rides.  She is a Hogan follower, and=
 Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult.  With regard to th=
e relationship between CM and resource planning, transmission is a monopoly=
, and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision - decide where=
 to site generation or transmission and take a risk.  FERC should not overr=
ide that principle.  Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut cong=
estion management.

Reem Fahey:  RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator.  Ca=
nnot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion.  CM should have=
 a bid-based structure with LMP.  Design of CM should allow flexibility for=
 market participants to be in the spot and forward markets.  Transmission r=
ights - must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hed=
ging in real time.  FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs a=
nd market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load. =
 These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system.

Carol Guthrie:  Her company has diverse interests in electricity market - o=
ver 4,000 service locations, over 150 suppliers, more than 15 sites where t=
hey have industrial generation serving own load (500 MW). =20

Shmuel Oren:  Advocates minimal ISOs, direct assignment of congestion costs=
 in real time, flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralize=
d coordination and supports forward rights.  Does not support "one size fit=
s all."  Need to understand gaming, modes of market failure.  Problems in T=
exas - people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve t=
he congestion.  Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable.

Andy Ott:  There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works=
.  It's an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during c=
onstraints.  PJM has been using nodal pricing since 1998.  Utilities have r=
un their system on this approach for years - economic dispatch to meet dema=
nd.  Cannot do balancing and CM separately -- does not work.  Transmission =
rights must be financial.  Spot market is physical.  Financial model is the=
 hedging.  You need this separation because it allows players to do bilater=
als or buy or sell from the spot market.  Also allows FTRs to be traded and=
 used to protect from congestion. =20

Michael Schnitzer:  There is a preferred method of CM - the LMP based CM sy=
stem with financial rights.  DAM and RT bid-based security constrained loca=
tional pricing markets.  Bilateral transactions are allowed.  Transmission =
rights must be financial, not physical.  Allows transmission users to hedge=
 congestion costs.  Why is CM so important?  Need to get the prices right t=
o give the right signals to the market.  Three goals:  1) get dispatch righ=
t - show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can re=
spond accordingly; 2) price signals to generation for location purposes - c=
larifies responsibility and risk allocations; 3) market signals for when to=
 expand the grid - LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FT=
Rs.

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  The panelists=
 agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tr=
adable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or=
 flowgates are actually more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable;=
 Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

 Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

 Let me know if you have any questions.

Attached is a summary of the New York RTO Order issued by FERC late 
yesterday. I apologize for the length, but I wanted to include a number of 
quotes from the Order that repeat arguments that we have been making over the 
past few years. In a procedural Order issued today, FERC has scheduled the 
Northeast mediation process to begin next Thursday, July 19th.

Ginger asked me to forward this summary to you, and that Steve asked you to 
send it to others.  Please note that the attached summary is just the first 
in several to come today, and I will send them to you as we finish them.  
However, the PJM one is probably the most important one, so it's a good one 
to get out early.

Please call me if you have any questions.

		 Subject: PJM RTO Order

Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, 
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the 
group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing 
configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and 
will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just 
let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will 
keep you updated.

Subject: Re: Southern  RTO  

I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday.  They talked 
about what is going on with the non-jurisdictional utilities that have signed 
a MOU to develop a RTO.  The group has met a couple of times to discuss the 
process they will use.  Confidentiality agreements have been signed, so no 
details are available, but they have agreed to a voting structure for the 
development.  Southern has about one third of the votes (and 65%of the 
assets) and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to 
carry a vote.  Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other 
parties that Southern was not going to run, or dominate, the process.  After 
that, Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for 
the development.  

They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the 
RTO work and resolve the hurdles the non-jurisdictional utilities have been 
expressing with the development of other RTOs.  They said there were some 
rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldn't be sure agreement would 
be reached, but at this point there was a lot of cooperation. 

Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by 
Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete 
RTO filing could be ready by 12/15/01.  They also said they thought this is 
what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean.  

We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development.  
They said that it was too early to make any commitment, but the group had 
started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available 
by late summer. 
They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide 
stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise 
the development group as early as possible.  They said they understood the 
difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial 
filing and wanted to do it different, but they pointed out again that 
Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group.  
In the meantime, they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any 
part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated 
in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or 
other members of the development group.

Jim, I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and 
Steve Kean, and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come.  I 
don't think they want to discuss anything technical at this point; they just 
want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the 
quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area, and they want any help 
we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run.  

I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southern's May 15th 
status report, either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority ( 
Donna, I guess that's who you meant in the memo below, since AEC has signed a 
MOU with Southern?).  I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we 
haven't heard from EPSA on its filing.  I still think that's the best 
approach.

		 Subject: Southern  supplemental status report

I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its 
RT01-77 on June 20.  They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp, 
Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO.  
These are really general, more of the same of what we've seen from Southern.

Also we had talked  about possible comments on the May 15 Southern filing; 
Coral was working on comments through EPSA.  Nothing has been filed by EPSA 
yet.  

Alabama did file comments on the May 15 status report and they have asked 
that the FERC establish a technical conference to "publicly air and evaluate 
the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant 
delay..."  Following a technical conference, they ask for a judge to convene 
a settlement conference at FERC to "undertake a properly supervised and 
serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time."

At this point we could consider filing comments in support of the Coop 
comments.

Steve --

If still ok, I think that we should try and establish the date for the 
Southern - Enron meeting per Joe's message below.  It would be good to hear 
their viewpoints (just to know where they are coming from).

Subject: Re: Southern  RTO  

I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday.  They talked 
about what is going on with the non-jurisdictional utilities that have signed 
a MOU to develop a RTO.  The group has met a couple of times to discuss the 
process they will use.  Confidentiality agreements have been signed, so no 
details are available, but they have agreed to a voting structure for the 
development.  Southern has about one third of the votes (and 65%of the 
assets) and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to 
carry a vote.  Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other 
parties that Southern was not going to run, or dominate, the process.  After 
that, Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for 
the development.  

They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the 
RTO work and resolve the hurdles the non-jurisdictional utilities have been 
expressing with the development of other RTOs.  They said there were some 
rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldn't be sure agreement would 
be reached, but at this point there was a lot of cooperation. 

Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by 
Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete 
RTO filing could be ready by 12/15/01.  They also said they thought this is 
what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean.  

We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development.  
They said that it was too early to make any commitment, but the group had 
started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available 
by late summer. 
They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide 
stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise 
the development group as early as possible.  They said they understood the 
difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial 
filing and wanted to do it different, but they pointed out again that 
Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group.  
In the meantime, they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any 
part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated 
in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or 
other members of the development group.

Jim, I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and 
Steve Kean, and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come.  I 
don't think they want to discuss anything technical at this point; they just 
want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the 
quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area, and they want any help 
we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run.  

I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southern's May 15th 
status report, either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority ( 
Donna, I guess that's who you meant in the memo below, since AEC has signed a 
MOU with Southern?).  I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we 
haven't heard from EPSA on its filing.  I still think that's the best 
approach.

		 Subject: Southern  supplemental status report

I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its 
RT01-77 on June 20.  They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp, 
Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO.  
These are really general, more of the same of what we've seen from Southern.

Also we had talked  about possible comments on the May 15 Southern filing; 
Coral was working on comments through EPSA.  Nothing has been filed by EPSA 
yet.  

Alabama did file comments on the May 15 status report and they have asked 
that the FERC establish a technical conference to "publicly air and evaluate 
the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant 
delay..."  Following a technical conference, they ask for a judge to convene 
a settlement conference at FERC to "undertake a properly supervised and 
serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time."

At this point we could consider filing comments in support of the Coop 
comments.

These questsions seem to be focus on the modularity of the product.  This is 
fine from the vendors' perspectives, however, from a Tariff perspective, it 
hints at conceding to others' tariiffs/structures.  There should be a few 
questions that paint the entire Real Flow solution - even referencing that a 
tariff is available.

Also, can I assume the entities listed are endorsing eTransMart?  Or do they 
not even know their name is referenced here?

Subject: Re: Southern  RTO  

I would guess that AEC has had a change of heart - since they signed the MOU 
with Southern.  I would expect them to withdraw their comments.  I will talk 
to Jeff Parrish at AEC and find out what's going on.

I talked to Bob Reilley about the EPSA filing.  He made it sound like it had 
just been forgotten in the rush and he didn't seem to have a clear idea about 
what EPSA should say in a filing.  That's funny since he drafted the original 
document we started talking from.  Anyway, we discussed it again and he 
agreed to get back to EPSA and discuss a filing.  The topics would be:
(1) MOUs don't mean much
(2) No real progress has been shown
(3) FERC need to oversee the process
(4) FERC needs to ensure a collaborative process is implemented
I didn't tell Bob that Enron wants to stay out of it, but we talked about it 
being better to have EPSA carry the ball when we first started looking at 
this.  I think your bringing it up in the EPSA phone call will help.  Let me 
know if it looks like Bob is not following up with EPSA.

Joe, I agree with the approach that we should try to get EPSA to file.  I 
have spoken with Mark Bennett over at EPSA and he indicated that he hadn't 
gotten to it.  Perhaps I should bring it up on the EPSA call this Thursday, 
just a gentle reminder.

AEC was the culprit who commented on June 22.  They were extremely negative 
about Southern's lack of results in their "attempt" to increase participation 
in the RTO.  They said, "Southern suggests no more than the possibility of 
another paper 'RTO proposal' by December 15, 2001."  They do ask for a 
technical conference by FERC staff and then a settlement judge proceeding 
thereafter.

		 Subject: Re: Southern  RTO

I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday.  They talked 
about what is going on with the non-jurisdictional utilities that have signed 
a MOU to develop a RTO.  The group has met a couple of times to discuss the 
process they will use.  Confidentiality agreements have been signed, so no 
details are available, but they have agreed to a voting structure for the 
development.  Southern has about one third of the votes (and 65%of the 
assets) and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to 
carry a vote.  Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other 
parties that Southern was not going to run, or dominate, the process.  After 
that, Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for 
the development.  

They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the 
RTO work and resolve the hurdles the non-jurisdictional utilities have been 
expressing with the development of other RTOs.  They said there were some 
rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldn't be sure agreement would 
be reached, but at this point there was a lot of cooperation. 

Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by 
Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete 
RTO filing could be ready by 12/15/01.  They also said they thought this is 
what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean.  

We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development.  
They said that it was too early to make any commitment, but the group had 
started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available 
by late summer. 
They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide 
stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise 
the development group as early as possible.  They said they understood the 
difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial 
filing and wanted to do it different, but they pointed out again that 
Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group.  
In the meantime, they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any 
part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated 
in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or 
other members of the development group.

Jim, I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and 
Steve Kean, and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come.  I 
don't think they want to discuss anything technical at this point; they just 
want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the 
quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area, and they want any help 
we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run.  

I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southern's May 15th 
status report, either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority ( 
Donna, I guess that's who you meant in the memo below, since AEC has signed a 
MOU with Southern?).  I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we 
haven't heard from EPSA on its filing.  I still think that's the best 
approach.

		 Subject: Southern  supplemental status report

I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its 
RT01-77 on June 20.  They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp, 
Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO.  
These are really general, more of the same of what we've seen from Southern.

Also we had talked  about possible comments on the May 15 Southern filing; 
Coral was working on comments through EPSA.  Nothing has been filed by EPSA 
yet.  

Alabama did file comments on the May 15 status report and they have asked 
that the FERC establish a technical conference to "publicly air and evaluate 
the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant 
delay..."  Following a technical conference, they ask for a judge to convene 
a settlement conference at FERC to "undertake a properly supervised and 
serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time."

At this point we could consider filing comments in support of the Coop 
comments.

Judge McCartney presented her report on the SE RTO mediation to FERC last Wed.  Her recommendation was for the Grid model: Transco on top/Independent Market Admin. (IMA) in the RTO (model presented by GridSouth, Grid Florida and Entergy) rather than Southern's model (Gridco on top, transmission owners and ind. transcos under).  The Commissioners did not make a decision, but stated that they planned to address the SE RTO at the next Commission meeting on Nov 7 (after they have received comments on RTO week).

The judge discussed the biggest obstacles to public power agreeing to the Grid model:  Southern gave them 100% transmission recovery on Day 1 and the Grids had a phase-in (pursuant to the Commission's previous orders in GridFlorida).  I think that many of the publics also liked the fact that Southern gave them full grandfathering of current contracts.

Chair Wood had questions about the split of responsibilities between the transmission-owning transco on top and the IMA and about the fiduciary duties of the transco board.  The judge stated that most publics wanted a non-profit ISO on top.  When Massey stated that most states wanted the traditional non-profit ISO, Wood said: "that would put the cabosh on this model," then asked why the publics don't like the operating agreements with the RTO.  There was discussion about concerns that the transco would favor transmission solutions over gen.  Massey pointed out that the NE ISOs simply don't want their models changed, so that should not keep the Commission from approving the transco-type model.

Breathitt stated that cost/benefit analyses were important, especially for this region of low cost power.

Brownell stated that the Commission needed to act quickly because the market was already putting capital into transcos.

Yep, you are still a junkie and the first to ask for these.    

This next one RT01-100 is the ALJ order setting the mediation settlement 
conference, starting Tuesday, July 17.

Attached is a summary of the New York RTO Order issued by FERC late yesterday. I apologize for the length, but I wanted to include a number of quotes from the Order that repeat arguments that we have been making over the past few years. In a procedural Order issued today, FERC has scheduled the Northeast mediation process to begin next Thursday, July 19th.

Steve --

If still ok, I think that we should try and establish the date for the Southern - Enron meeting per Joe's message below.  It would be good to hear their viewpoints (just to know where they are coming from).

Subject:	Re: Southern  RTO   

I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday.  They talked about what is going on with the non-jurisdictional utilities that have signed a MOU to develop a RTO.  The group has met a couple of times to discuss the process they will use.  Confidentiality agreements have been signed, so no details are available, but they have agreed to a voting structure for the development.  Southern has about one third of the votes (and 65%of the assets) and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to carry a vote.  Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other parties that Southern was not going to run, or dominate, the process.  After that, Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for the development.  

They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the RTO work and resolve the hurdles the non-jurisdictional utilities have been expressing with the development of other RTOs.  They said there were some rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldn't be sure agreement would be reached, but at this point there was a lot of cooperation. 

Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete RTO filing could be ready by 12/15/01.  They also said they thought this is what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean.  

We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development.  They said that it was too early to make any commitment, but the group had started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available by late summer. 
They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise the development group as early as possible.  They said they understood the difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial filing and wanted to do it different, but they pointed out again that Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group.  In the meantime, they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or other members of the development group.

Jim, I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and Steve Kean, and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come.  I don't think they want to discuss anything technical at this point; they just want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area, and they want any help we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run.  

I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southern's May 15th status report, either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority ( Donna, I guess that's who you meant in the memo below, since AEC has signed a MOU with Southern?).  I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we haven't heard from EPSA on its filing.  I still think that's the best approach.






	Donna Fulton 06/28/2001 12:02 PM 	   To: Joe Connor/NA/Enron@Enron, Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT@ECT  cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Southern  supplemental status report	


I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its RT01-77 on June 20.  They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp, Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO.  These are really general, more of the same of what we've seen from Southern.

Also we had talked  about possible comments on the May 15 Southern filing; Coral was working on comments through EPSA.  Nothing has been filed by EPSA yet.  

Alabama did file comments on the May 15 status report and they have asked that the FERC establish a technical conference to "publicly air and evaluate the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant delay..."  Following a technical conference, they ask for a judge to convene a settlement conference at FERC to "undertake a properly supervised and serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time."

At this point we could consider filing comments in support of the Coop comments.

Jim,

The pilot RTO Info Database is attached as per your request. Please 
understand that this is a preliminary Draft of the database. 

The database is pretty straightforward. The first page contains a list(with 
links) of the current RTO in the database.
Document links for the talking points/Key issues have been completed for 
DStar, Florida, and Southeastern.
The others will be completed shortly. 

I welcome any suggestions/concerns as I will be changing most of the fields 
of the database on an ongoing basis.

DH

p.s. If you have problems entering text or making changes the password to

A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

Thane, I think the doc that was prepared needs to be more user friendly and 
explain better what is intended.  For example, what is shadowing.  What do 
want with anciliary services?  Should all ancilliary services be deregulated 
and available at market based rates or should they be available at the 
suppliers option based on a tariff rate, etc.  We should not assume that the 
reader understands what we want.  Thanks.
Janine

Perhaps them having no say is a big step but it appears that they, in reality 
have all the say.

		 Subject: Re: Enron Response to October 15 RTO Filings/Southeastern RTO

I don't have what Southern filed.  I understand the filing will be on 
Southern's web page (www.southernco.com) within a couple of days.  I'm in 
Virginia at the SERC Joint Committee Meeting and won't get the filings until 
I get home Friday night.

As for an independent Board, as long as Southern owns the transmission assets 
as it does in the proposed for-profit Gridco, there is about zero possibility 
of them agreeing to have no say in the selection of the Board or in setting 
the incentive plan.  What specifically are you concerned about (the selection 
process or the incentive plan or both)?  I think we have a shot at getting 
them to consider changing the setting of the incentive plan to let the Board 
do it, as long as it is restricted such that it cannot impact the value of 
the assets.  Any thoughts?

SK - I forwarded this to the group too.  mm=20

The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we exp=
ected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s=
atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The Com=
mission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it=
s neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf=
iguration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a la=
ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they=
 failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or =
what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order s=
tates that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmi=
ssion organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission indicates t=
hat they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the order requir=
es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss=
ions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these meetings will star=
t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac=
teristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach to f=
ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The order =
states, "We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the=
 Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible."  =
The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b=
e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo=
pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal=
e electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the media=
tion as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta=
rting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other =
aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm=
ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, I am=
 attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the or=
der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs ar=
e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  The=
refore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi=
le a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


>From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

Even if it meets all the other requirements for an RTO, if the Board is a 
creature of Southern Company's selection and serving at the pleasure of 
Southern Company , it cannot be an independent organization.  There might be 
minor gains on the code of conduct issues, and this could be a hopeful 
indication of a move to full divestiture.  However,  the Gridco will still be 
in the position of proving its innocence whenever its actions seem to aid 
Southern Company.  Even if the organization were perfect in every way except 
for independence, no one can be sure that it is not acting in the interests 
of the integrated utility.  I see little value in the Gridco authoring a 
incentive plan vs the parent being the author, as long as the Board is not 
independent of the incumbent enterprise.

Perhaps them having no say is a big step but it appears that they, in reality

I don't have what Southern filed.  I understand the filing will be on 
Southern's web page (www.southernco.com) within a couple of days.  I'm in 
Virginia at the SERC Joint Committee Meeting and won't get the filings until 
I get home Friday night.

As for an independent Board, as long as Southern owns the transmission assets 
as it does in the proposed for-profit Gridco, there is about zero possibility 
of them agreeing to have no say in the selection of the Board or in setting 
the incentive plan.  What specifically are you concerned about (the selection 
process or the incentive plan or both)?  I think we have a shot at getting 
them to consider changing the setting of the incentive plan to let the Board 
do it, as long as it is restricted such that it cannot impact the value of 
the assets.  Any thoughts?

CONFIDENTIAL 

Later today we will receive the 2 plan proposals (one from the Grids and Entergy, etal. and one from Southern, Santee Cooper, GTC, etal).  Our response is due to the judge on Friday by 3:30.  We will have a meeting this week to discuss our response (our SE team -- (Joe, Luiz, and me) -- will prepare the response).

The judge has then scheduled the mediation "negotiations" for next Tues and Wed. in DC.  She is only allowing 3 parties from each sector to actually attend.  The power marketer sector reps are Enron, Williams and PSEG.  I will attend the negotiations for Enron.  The majority of IPP/trading entities chose to be in the IPP sector, which is represented by Calpine, Reliant and DENA.  Our views are very consistent in these two sectors.

The judge hopes to have a consensus reached during the negotiation phase*, but will make her own recommendation to FERC on what the SE RTO should look like absent a consensus.  She plans to report to the Commission the first week of Sept.



*No party is waiving any rights to protest her decision by participating in the negotiations, and clearly, those not attending retain their rights.  She simply wants to have a smaller group to facilitate the discussion next week.

Yesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session.  Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is "subject to extension" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.

One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.

Background

The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a "business plan" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.

Market Design

At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years ("Option 1-M"of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years ("Option 2-M" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 ("Option 3-M" of the Business Plan).  

We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.  

As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining "Best Practices."  Although PJM also conducted a "best practices" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are "best practices."  

The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) "far outstrips" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that "impatience, haste and greed" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process "at the expense of sound policy" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to "exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint." See Report, page 18.

Governance

The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.

PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).  

NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.  

We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.

Post Mediation

The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.  

The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.

Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.

Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.

Sarah, Dan, Howard and Tom

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.
