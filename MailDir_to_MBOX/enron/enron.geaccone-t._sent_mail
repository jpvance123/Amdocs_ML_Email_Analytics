FROM : 	ROD HAYSLETT

SUBJECT:	THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FUNCTIONALLY DRIVEN PROCESS 
ORGANIZATION

Last year we began an initiative whose end goal was the evolution of our former pipeline entity focused organization into an Enron Transportation Services (ETS) oriented process driven structure.   The reason for the new structure is fueled by the need to develop momentum on growing our business more broadly by focusing our best efforts in all areas which support meeting aggressive ETS targets.

To achieve that vision, several steps must occur in the first quarter of this year.   Simply stated, the vision of the company must be communicated clearly and effectively to all members, so individual departments can identify the areas of responsibility and opportunity available to them to achieve this vision. 

In the process of clarifying how we can most effectively utilize our experience and skills to achieve this goal, Rutherford Consulting will be assisting us.  Many of you have already met members of the Rutherford Consulting team currently on site or you will have the opportunity to do so in the coming weeks.

We have formed a Joint Implementation Team who will focus on the development and implementation of the functionally structured organization.  From our organization the following individuals have been selected to work with the Rutherford team in realizing this goal:  John Cobb, Dan Fancler, Patricia Wiederholt, Anne Jolibois, Jennifer Lev, Denis Tu and Caroline Barnes.

Although it is not possible for all of you to participate on the committee, your individual expertise is critical. Your participation and input will be requested over the ensuing weeks as the recommendations are unfolded.

Together with the Rutherford Consulting team, we will focus on the successful implementation of the functional structure, promote the development of an internal customer service orientation, and develop the foundational processes required to insure the perpetuation of the new operating methods.

Your creative and thoughtful participation will ultimately generate the dynamic and responsive organization that will master the challenges of today and tomorrow

Steve Harris has his group meeting some where and they have hired a bus to take them to and from the rodeo.  Just a suggestion.

Subject:=09Pilot Meeting

There's a lot going on!  We want to update you, and we want to invite you t=
o view a pilot of a financial data warehouse.  The pilot shows cost reporti=
ng using a small sample of real data (see below for more description).  Her=
e's the schedule to view the pilot.  Please contact Jennifer Reed at x39406=
 to RSVP, so we'll know if we need to schedule more sessions.

We've mapped out a strategy in each of these areas, set deliverables and ex=
pect to accomplish a lot while our BU reps are with us from Feb. 20th to 28=
th.

Data Warehouse Project Update

The cost reporting pilot has been built by Beverly Fennessy and the technic=
al team based on the design Li Chan has specified based on your input from =
the initial interviews, followups and several cost reporting workshops she =
has sponsored in the last month.

The pilot will be a mini-cost reporting button, using a small subset of act=
ual financial data from SAP-CO (one BU, three months of data), and showing =
only the cost center information (not project info).  It is designed to tes=
t this solution's (Acta/Oracle/Business Objects) ability to:

1.=09extract data from SAP using Acta,
2.=09report data using a team structure,
3.=09develop usable, presentable and technically efficient "canned reports,=
" and
4.=09provide users an ad-hoc query tool for reporting and analysis not cove=
red by canned reports.

The BU reps need to become familiar with the pilot, and all of our intervie=
w participants are invited to see the pilot and evaluate the tool.
We'll have a questionnaire for your comments and suggestions, which we will=
 incorporate into the development of the actual cost reporting button.  The=
re's a distribution list at the end of this memo - if you know of someone i=
n your group who should attend, please invite them.

 Assuming no significant changes are identified in the user review of the p=
ilot, we expect at least a portion of the cost reporting from the data ware=
house to be rolled into production by the end of April.  So be sure to voic=
e your input!

The second part of the warehouse will be cash reporting.  Steve Frazier is =
the BU rep leading this effort, with Mike Deville from Corp Reporting and S=
usan Bellinghausen from the ISC providing input.  We are working on both di=
rect and indirect cash flow (historical) and trying to determine the best w=
ay to source the data.  We'd like to get it from SAP since that's where we =
can get the most detail, with the Treasury workstation as the source for ma=
nual wires not yet input into SAP.  However, Susan's group has told us that=
 the current SAP design won't allow us to use the Cash Budget Management mo=
dule since that information doesn't tie to FI (due to differences in value =
date and posting date).  Therefore, we're looking at what SAP design change=
s might be needed.

The next step will be earnings, which will expand cost reporting by bringin=
g in gross margin, other income, interest expense, minority interest and ta=
xes.  We're hoping to be able to tie into the Energy Ops Project Enlighten =
(data warehouse) as a source of gross margin data for wholesale operations.

We envision that the counterparty reporting button will also interface with=
 other Enron warehousing efforts, such as Global Counterparty.

A significant objective of the warehouse is to provide ad hoc reporting, so=
 we will be looking at the data behind the reporting buttons and determinin=
g which other information should be transferred into the warehouse in the e=
arly phases.  Our strategy is to place only the information that is most re=
quested into the warehouse in the early phases, but to design the warehouse=
 to be flexible enough to allow additional fields to be transferred in over=
 time.

Budgeting and Forecasting Tool

In our interviews, many people expressed an interest in an automated planni=
ng tool.  We have looked at three products - SAP's SEM, Hyperion's Planning=
 and Adaytum's ePlanning. Some of you attended a demo of Adaytum last week.=
 We like because it seems to have the most functionality and  two Enron BUs=
 already use it (Europe and EBS).  We want to be able to plan for earnings =
as well as cash forecasting and projected balance sheets, with these number=
s feeding the warehouse so that our reporting could include both actuals an=
d plan or forecast.  We'd like to hear any thoughts you have on how you thi=
nk your BU would use a tool such as this.

We're evaluating the valuation proposition now and expect to can make a rec=
ommendation at Rick's February 27 staff meeting. =20

Susan Helton and James Weitekamp are working on this effort.

Close Process

Howard Selzer is leading the initiative to shorten the close process.  He i=
s gathering close calendars from each BU and is talking with each group abo=
ut possible opportunities to squeeze time out of the schedule.  He will als=
o focus on topside entries (after the 8th workday) to determine how to elim=
inate the need for these entries.  Glenn Kobes will provide the tax perspec=
tive.

Knowledge Sharing

Joe Darensbourg is preparing a plan to share best practices among groups.  =
He is also spearheading the Global Accounting Intranet site, which is one o=
f the media we can use.  A Web Advisory Team has been formed so that each B=
U will have input into how we can best communicate using this site (still w=
aiting for ETS and Europe to appoint representatives to this team).  Ideas =
for knowledge sharing include soliciting tips to be reviewed by the Web Adv=
isory Team and then posted to the intranet site, forming user groups in coo=
peration with the ISC (ETS has groups already in place), setting up a forum=
 to ask questions of other users (either as part of eThink or separately) a=
nd encouraging participation in the Houston ASUG (SAP user group).  We'll w=
ant to coordinate with the ISC's efforts to avoid duplication (they have FA=
Qs on their web site).

Alternate Hierarchies

Caroline Lothian is working to compare and document how the each BU uses al=
ternate hierarchies for reporting. This specifically addresses team reporti=
ng, but also includes anything other than the legal rollup.  A common desig=
n for team report hierarchies is necessary to build canned reports in the d=
ata warehouse, since we expect you will want to include data at drill-down =
levels such as BU, line of business, team, profit center and cost center. B=
eyond a team hierarchy, we're really looking to share best practices rather=
 than build a common standard.

Number of Entities and Cost Objects

Currently we have about 1,900 legal or accounting entities and nearly 200,0=
00 cost objects in SAP.  As far as we know, this is the largest number amon=
g all of SAP's customers.  We want to be proactive in controlling these num=
bers before they have the possibility of bringing our systems to their knee=
s.  In addition, the large number of entities and cost objects result in ex=
tra costs related to tax compliance and accounting maintenance, as well as =
the intangible costs related to higher complexity.  Jill Erwin is heading a=
n initiative to first find out how the BUs use various cost objects and whe=
ther there may be a way to simplify their use, and then to identify ways to=
 ensure that new entities and cost objects are set up only when that is the=
 best way to accomplish Enron's objectives.

Training and Change Management

In our interviews, we heard about some problems that may be able to be reso=
lved through specific training.  We will also need training on the new tool=
s and initiatives that will be implemented in Project Sunrise.  It is also =
important for us to continue to communicate with various accounting groups =
as to what Project Sunrise is doing so that we can ensure that we provide w=
hat users really need.  Madeline Chan and Dave McEllin are taking the lead =
on what approach we should take on training.  We have also spoken with the =
Change Management team in the ISC (under Andy Lawrence), who has agreed to =
provide direction and resources as well as help ensure that together we are=
 providing seamless service to our users.
=20
Other Issues

Other areas that we intend to address in Project Sunrise include the automa=
tion of buckets and e-schedules, balance sheets by profit center, intercomp=
any issues and foreign currency issues.  In addition, we working with Susan=
 Bellinghausen and Rick Boehm (ISC) to provide better reporting related to =
payroll distribution and labor distribution.

As you can see, this is a very broad project, and we want to be sure each B=
U is properly represented.  If you'd like to offer additional resources to =
Sunrise, either in general or related to a specific initiative, please call=
 Mark at x57193 or Jan at x33260.  Attached is the mailing list.

Ken Powers has been developing a Business Objects report along with Lindy Donoho and Jim Wiltfong.  They are trying to create a daily system balancing report by capturing reciepts, deliveries, fuel, OBA and Park and Ride activity  - all per pipeline segment.   The objective is to get a better handle on fuel.

Updates....



Corporate Overhead allocations are complete.
EGF Assessments are complete.
ENA Research Group Assessments are complete.
CATS entries for prior month were posted and final hours were transferred to CO and PS. 

Due to Labor Distribution valuation issues, True-Up postings are being postponed in order to allow time to analyze and correct the errors. We will evaluate our progress on Monday morning and provide you with an update in the close meeting.  Best case scenario we will begin running allocations on Monday afternoon. 

See you at 9am CST EB48C2 on Monday.

I am not sure what this is.  I thought we were billing the costs down to a legal entity.  This does not tie to the numbers Elise gave us.

This year we will be looking at the income statement on a functional basis rather than a legal entity basis.  As such, it is important the you and/or your functional unit coordinator (BUC) attend these meetings.  Your BUC should be meeting with you prior to these meetings to review your numbers.  We sent a planning calendar out last week which shows when these meetings are scheduled.  You do not need to attend the pre-meetings.  

Our first meeting with Stan for the first quarter is on Friday, February 23 at 3:30 in 49C2.

Please let me know if you did not receive the calendar or could not find it on the intranet.

We will bill in February the full amount.  We will not bill any charges in March unless services are being provided.  
This should apply to the Corporate charges as well.  The corporate charges should not be reallocated amongst only ETS companies.  They should be spread across all Enron Business units.

Thanks

Tracy

Effective 2/16/01, approximately 65 employees will move over to HPL Co. 0012.  Please have Corporate and ETS charges to Co. 0584 stop as soon as possible as we will not be able to charge them to ENA.  These should be charged instead to Co. 0012.

Karen, if you have any specific comments on this please let me know as soon as possible.

I think we should show margins and expense and come down to net contribution.  I think it be important to maintain the margin stuff separately.  We also should show the assets sales and others separately.

Subject:	Re: 1st QTR Forecast Margin   

Tracy, I agree.  We just weren't there yet last week when we met with Danny.  

Tracy and Steve, I want to substitute "Net Contribution Commercial" for the Net Margin on my combination schedule.  Do you have the other line items by Quarter that you can come to a Net Contribution Commercial number?

I think you should include net commercial contribution as that is what Danny is responsible for.  Can you add to this schedule.

Subject:	1st QTR Forecast Margin

Please look at attached schedule.  Tracy, please fill in TW. 

Steve, I have a $0.1 rounding problem.  Where should it be fixed?  I filled this in from your 2/16/01 file.

I will begin keeping this schedule without explanations.  This is designed very similar to how Tracy keeps her IBIT and NI for ETS as a whole.  Explanations and story line should be included on your individual margin pages just as we showed Danny last week.

I will do the planning for this company.  I assume Jennifer Lev's group will do the accounting as it is an ETS company.  Please let me know if you decide anything different.

Subject:=09Pilot Meeting

There's a lot going on!  We want to update you, and we want to invite you t=

ng using a small sample of real data (see below for more description).  Her=
e's the schedule to view the pilot.  Please contact Jennifer Reed at x39406=
 to RSVP, so we'll know if we need to schedule more sessions.

We've mapped out a strategy in each of these areas, set deliverables and ex=
pect to accomplish a lot while our BU reps are with us from Feb. 20th to 28=
th.

Data Warehouse Project Update

The cost reporting pilot has been built by Beverly Fennessy and the technic=
al team based on the design Li Chan has specified based on your input from =
the initial interviews, followups and several cost reporting workshops she =
has sponsored in the last month.

The pilot will be a mini-cost reporting button, using a small subset of act=
ual financial data from SAP-CO (one BU, three months of data), and showing =
only the cost center information (not project info).  It is designed to tes=
t this solution's (Acta/Oracle/Business Objects) ability to:

1.=09extract data from SAP using Acta,
2.=09report data using a team structure,
3.=09develop usable, presentable and technically efficient "canned reports,=
" and
4.=09provide users an ad-hoc query tool for reporting and analysis not cove=
red by canned reports.

The BU reps need to become familiar with the pilot, and all of our intervie=
w participants are invited to see the pilot and evaluate the tool.
We'll have a questionnaire for your comments and suggestions, which we will=
 incorporate into the development of the actual cost reporting button.  The=
re's a distribution list at the end of this memo - if you know of someone i=
n your group who should attend, please invite them.

 Assuming no significant changes are identified in the user review of the p=
ilot, we expect at least a portion of the cost reporting from the data ware=
house to be rolled into production by the end of April.  So be sure to voic=
e your input!

The second part of the warehouse will be cash reporting.  Steve Frazier is =
the BU rep leading this effort, with Mike Deville from Corp Reporting and S=
usan Bellinghausen from the ISC providing input.  We are working on both di=
rect and indirect cash flow (historical) and trying to determine the best w=
ay to source the data.  We'd like to get it from SAP since that's where we =
can get the most detail, with the Treasury workstation as the source for ma=
nual wires not yet input into SAP.  However, Susan's group has told us that=
 the current SAP design won't allow us to use the Cash Budget Management mo=
dule since that information doesn't tie to FI (due to differences in value =
date and posting date).  Therefore, we're looking at what SAP design change=
s might be needed.

The next step will be earnings, which will expand cost reporting by bringin=
g in gross margin, other income, interest expense, minority interest and ta=
xes.  We're hoping to be able to tie into the Energy Ops Project Enlighten =
(data warehouse) as a source of gross margin data for wholesale operations.

We envision that the counterparty reporting button will also interface with=
 other Enron warehousing efforts, such as Global Counterparty.

A significant objective of the warehouse is to provide ad hoc reporting, so=
 we will be looking at the data behind the reporting buttons and determinin=
g which other information should be transferred into the warehouse in the e=
arly phases.  Our strategy is to place only the information that is most re=
quested into the warehouse in the early phases, but to design the warehouse=
 to be flexible enough to allow additional fields to be transferred in over=
 time.

Budgeting and Forecasting Tool

In our interviews, many people expressed an interest in an automated planni=
ng tool.  We have looked at three products - SAP's SEM, Hyperion's Planning=
 and Adaytum's ePlanning. Some of you attended a demo of Adaytum last week.=
 We like because it seems to have the most functionality and  two Enron BUs=
 already use it (Europe and EBS).  We want to be able to plan for earnings =
as well as cash forecasting and projected balance sheets, with these number=
s feeding the warehouse so that our reporting could include both actuals an=
d plan or forecast.  We'd like to hear any thoughts you have on how you thi=
nk your BU would use a tool such as this.

We're evaluating the valuation proposition now and expect to can make a rec=
ommendation at Rick's February 27 staff meeting. =20

Susan Helton and James Weitekamp are working on this effort.

Close Process

Howard Selzer is leading the initiative to shorten the close process.  He i=
s gathering close calendars from each BU and is talking with each group abo=
ut possible opportunities to squeeze time out of the schedule.  He will als=
o focus on topside entries (after the 8th workday) to determine how to elim=
inate the need for these entries.  Glenn Kobes will provide the tax perspec=
tive.

Knowledge Sharing

Joe Darensbourg is preparing a plan to share best practices among groups.  =
He is also spearheading the Global Accounting Intranet site, which is one o=
f the media we can use.  A Web Advisory Team has been formed so that each B=
U will have input into how we can best communicate using this site (still w=
aiting for ETS and Europe to appoint representatives to this team).  Ideas =
for knowledge sharing include soliciting tips to be reviewed by the Web Adv=
isory Team and then posted to the intranet site, forming user groups in coo=
peration with the ISC (ETS has groups already in place), setting up a forum=
 to ask questions of other users (either as part of eThink or separately) a=
nd encouraging participation in the Houston ASUG (SAP user group).  We'll w=
ant to coordinate with the ISC's efforts to avoid duplication (they have FA=
Qs on their web site).

Alternate Hierarchies

Caroline Lothian is working to compare and document how the each BU uses al=
ternate hierarchies for reporting. This specifically addresses team reporti=
ng, but also includes anything other than the legal rollup.  A common desig=
n for team report hierarchies is necessary to build canned reports in the d=
ata warehouse, since we expect you will want to include data at drill-down =
levels such as BU, line of business, team, profit center and cost center. B=
eyond a team hierarchy, we're really looking to share best practices rather=
 than build a common standard.

Number of Entities and Cost Objects

Currently we have about 1,900 legal or accounting entities and nearly 200,0=
00 cost objects in SAP.  As far as we know, this is the largest number amon=
g all of SAP's customers.  We want to be proactive in controlling these num=
bers before they have the possibility of bringing our systems to their knee=
s.  In addition, the large number of entities and cost objects result in ex=
tra costs related to tax compliance and accounting maintenance, as well as =
the intangible costs related to higher complexity.  Jill Erwin is heading a=
n initiative to first find out how the BUs use various cost objects and whe=
ther there may be a way to simplify their use, and then to identify ways to=
 ensure that new entities and cost objects are set up only when that is the=
 best way to accomplish Enron's objectives.

Training and Change Management

In our interviews, we heard about some problems that may be able to be reso=
lved through specific training.  We will also need training on the new tool=
s and initiatives that will be implemented in Project Sunrise.  It is also =
important for us to continue to communicate with various accounting groups =
as to what Project Sunrise is doing so that we can ensure that we provide w=
hat users really need.  Madeline Chan and Dave McEllin are taking the lead =
on what approach we should take on training.  We have also spoken with the =
Change Management team in the ISC (under Andy Lawrence), who has agreed to =
provide direction and resources as well as help ensure that together we are=
 providing seamless service to our users.
=20
Other Issues

Other areas that we intend to address in Project Sunrise include the automa=
tion of buckets and e-schedules, balance sheets by profit center, intercomp=
any issues and foreign currency issues.  In addition, we working with Susan=
 Bellinghausen and Rick Boehm (ISC) to provide better reporting related to =
payroll distribution and labor distribution.

As you can see, this is a very broad project, and we want to be sure each B=
U is properly represented.  If you'd like to offer additional resources to =
Sunrise, either in general or related to a specific initiative, please call=
 Mark at x57193 or Jan at x33260.  Attached is the mailing list.

Enclosed is the January property tax billing for EOTT. Please forward this billing to the correct EPSC accounting employee so it can be billed to EOTT. The Enron Corp property tax RC is Co/ 011 / 100029 and should be credited to account # 52507300.

Hopefully, this process meets with your approval.

I like the reports.  I think we need a input section where it lists data by contract/shipper where we can manipulate and add  data for weekly/daily deals.  I also would like for there to be a section to extend to outer years.  We also need to the far right of the monthly a quarterly sum.

Some IT people will be joining us at 4:00 today.

Not really, because assessments are run at the end of the month only.  We can bill 584 and then you guys can make an entry to move 1/2 to 012?

We will bill in February the full amount.  We will not bill any charges in March unless services are being provided.  
This should apply to the Corporate charges as well.  The corporate charges should not be reallocated amongst only ETS companies.  They should be spread across all Enron Business units.

Thanks

Effective 2/16/01, approximately 65 employees will move over to HPL Co. 0012.  Please have Corporate and ETS charges to Co. 0584 stop as soon as possible as we will not be able to charge them to ENA.  These should be charged instead to Co. 0012.

Karen, if you have any specific comments on this please let me know as soon as possible.

Subject:	Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo Half-Price Carnival Tickets


It is that time of year again when the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is coming to town.  You will want to be a part of the exciting 2001 Show!  This year the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo will donate $8 million for scholarships that benefit youth and support education.  I am once again a member of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Carnival Ticket Sales Committee.  

As part of that committee, I am selling carnival ticket books at half-price through February 9th, 2001.  This year there are two ways to save!

There is a book of 24 ride coupons and 2 2-for-1 refreshment coupons (drink and popcorn).  This is a $20 value available for only $10.   

For an even better deal, there is a book of 125 ride coupons, a free ride on the Hurricane family ride coupon, and 12 2-for-1 refreshment coupons (including drink, cotton candy, popcorn, french fries, and ice cream).  This is a $110 value available for only $50.

The tickets are valid at the carnival February 8th - 10th and February 13th - March 4th.  All proceeds go to benefit the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Scholarship and Educational Funds.

I also have Advance Livestock Show tickets available for sale.  (A Rodeo ticket (good date of ticket only) or Livestock show ticket is required for admission to carnival.)  The prices are:  
Adults (13 and over) are $6 each
Children (6 through 12) are just $3 each
Children under 6 will be admitted FREE
Season passes are just $20

This year there is very limited parking at the Astrodome.  10 Metro park and ride lots will be available for your commute to the Dome.  The best part is, the ride is FREE!

You say you don't have children or don't attend the carnival yourself...anyone has the opportunity to sponsor underprivileged children to attend the carnival every year.  The price of sponsoring a child is $10 but any donation is accepted and will be combined with other donations received to sponsor children. Donors who contribute $1,000 or more, will receive rodeo badges that get you into the Livestock show for free.  All donations are tax deductible.  Any Enron employee donating money can have it matched by Enron.  Every $1 counts! 

If anyone would like to purchase these tickets, they can contact me by phone at 713-853-5305, in the Enron Building in room 1354, or by email at debbie.yates@enron.com.  I have attached a flyer with all of the information.  Payment is accepted in the form of cash, MasterCard, Visa, American Express, or a check or money order made payable to the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo (HLSR).  I will be selling the ticket books until Friday, February 9th.

The 2001 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo schedule will be announced in the coming weeks!  I have attached the schedule for The Hideout.  For more information, visit the official Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo website at :  http://www.rodeohouston.com/.

Feel free to forward this note to anyone  you think might be interested.  Contact me with any questions.

If you no longer want to receive information from me about the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, please send me an email asking to be removed from my list.

 	 

Thank you for your support!

Debbie

FI close is the 8th workday after the Tax file comes back in.  I am assuming that you would not want to pick up any topside adjusting entries until they have hit FI which would be in the following month if the process is followed correctly.  Is the 8th workday sufficiant?

I'd like to have the information as soon as it is available each month.  I don't know what the regular close schedule is so I don't know when it would be safe to extract the data and be sure that you have the entire month's activity.  Our expense close is on the fifth workday so I'd like to aim for  a date as close to there as is possible.

Karl,

I'll take care of it for you.  I have to follow up on your ID and the job scheduling anyway.  Is there a certain day this will run each month? 5th workday perhaps?

Who will be the contact for getting the January 2001 file?  Assuming successful testing of the December data, I would like to have the January data next week.  We are scheduled to close expenses for the month of January on Wednesday Feb. 7 and would like to be able to interface the SAP file on that date.  (Not sure who's question this is, but when all else fails, I usually call Shelia.)  Thanks

Karl,

Here is a file with December's data from our QA environment.  The program that produces this data will be in production later today, so I'll get you a file from PR1 then.  I had to zip it up because it was too big to deliver.  I'll set you up with an userid and password so you can pick these up off our interface server once it is scheduled in production.

I'm now settled in London.  If you need to reach me, I'm at 783-4269 (trunk+34269).

Thanks,
Shawn

As recently seen on Houston TV, BSE
or Mad Cow Disease, is a widespread
concern especially here in Houston
because of the world wide participation in
the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

Please foward this simple yet effective
test to all those who are associated with
or are actual participants in the HLSR.
It is believed that this act may raise confidence
levels and eliminate unwarranted histeria.

Thank you very much.

Stan has not directed me to do so.  He is the one who told me to send the $15,000. It is not really a % of anything.  Its your call.

We are invoiced  $15,000 every month as an allocation of Stan's salary to EOTT.  We are currently working on the compensation section of EOTT's 10-K and I need to know if we are going to be allocated any of Stan's bonus and if so, what that amount will be because I will have to disclose the amount.  I figured you were the best person for me to ask.  If there is someone else I should talk to just let me know.  Thanks for the help.

Bob,

I have checked with Sandy Sheffield in credit and she says that Enron Liquid Services has not yet paid that $16,000.00.  Could you please give Tracy Geaccone a call.  We would like to get that off the books.  Thanks for all your help.

Subject: FW:  Think You're Having a Bad Day!

Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out section of
forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male
was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with SCUBA tanks on his back,
flippers, and face mask.

A post-mortem revealed that the person died not from burns, but from massive
internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification.
Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver ended up in
the middle of a forest fire.

It was revealed that, on the day of the fire, the person went for a diving
trip off the coast some 20 miles away from the forest. The firefighters,
seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called
in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from
the ocean then flown to the forest fire and emptied.

You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific,
the next he was doing the breast stroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the
air. Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'-10" of the
fire. Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed!
(This article was taken from the California Examiner)

STILL THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the
kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it
accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding on to the handle
bars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the
motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house.

The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found her husband
laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle laying next to him and
the shattered patio door. The wife ran to the phone and summoned an
ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the
several flights of stairs to the street to escort the paramedics to her
husband.

After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital, the
wife righted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas was
spilled on the floor, the wife got some paper towels, blotted up the
gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet.

The husband was treated and released to come home. Upon arriving at home, he
looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He
became despondent, went to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet and smoked a
cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs
into the toilet bowl while still seated.

The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and her husband
screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying on the
floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the
buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin. The wife again ran to the
phone to call the ambulance.

The very same paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the
street. The paramedics
loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street.
While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife,
one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself.

 She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them
slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell down the
remaining stairs and broke his arm.

I need a list of all 2000 dollars that we carried into 2001 by Wednesday.  You can round to the nearest $100,000.  Let me know if they are in the 2001 plan or not.

Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss TW maintenance scheduled for this year.  We would like to discuss when the maintenance will be, the duration, and what will be done.  Please be prepared to discuss any savings we will have from the plan for maintenance that will not have to be done because of our planned expansion (capital and expense.)  We will be meeting on Monday, February 26 at 3:00.  I will send out the location later today.

Subject:	2000 Vacation carryover

As of December 31, 2000 I have  69  hours of vacation remaining. This exceeds the normal 40 hours allowed to be carried over due to:

- SAP implementation- was responsible for Cost center master data update and upload- May to July 2000
- EOTT Operations- Cost Center set up and 2001 Plan consolidation and reconciliation.

Thanks

Subject:	March of Dimes Walk Team


Greetings,

It is once again time for the March of Dimes Walk America event.  This is the largest fundraising event for March of Dimes.  As you probably already know, March of Dimes is a non-profit organization focused on promotion of healthy babies and prevention of birth defects.  As you probably also already know, this is a cause near and dear to my heart.  In 1998, Enron provided no support for March of Dimes.   This was simply not acceptable for a company the size and stature of Enron.  Several of you agreed and we formed an Enron March of Dimes Walk Team.  A new team in 1999, we raised $12,000.  In 2000, Stan Horton lent us his executive support and we grew our efforts to $46,000 - earning us the position of 15th place of Houston March of Dimes Walk Teams.  

Enron employees have shown that this is a cause that they want to support.  I believe that we can take our 2001 Enron Walk Team to the next level, achieving a goal of $75,000 and earning a place in the top ten Houston walk teams.  Danny McCarty has agreed to serve as our executive sponsor for 2001.

Of course to accomplish this goal, it will take a group of dedicated team leaders.  Please consider joining me in this effort. 
I know you are all busy and running at full speed, but that is exactly why I need your help.  I believe that with a small but focused amount of your time over the next few weeks, we can accomplish significant results.  Fundraising is our primary goal, walking is not required!

Please give this some consideration and let me know in the next few days whether I can count on you to lead the team.  

I am planning a kick-off luncheon for next Friday, February 16. I promise that this will be our one and only one formal meeting.  We can handle all other coordination and planning via email.

Subject:	Planned Outages - TW Compressor Stations 1-4


In response to your comments made in Tuesday's TW Marketing Staff meeting regarding planned outages for TW CS 1 - 4, David Boothe and Jerry Graves have a meeting planned for Tuesday, 2/27, to discuss timelines, throughput affects, and work scope for each station.  The matrix of additional work that you have obtained is additional to the annual maintenance and safety device work that you are already aware of.  In lieu of performing major overhauls at each station due to the "Redrock Expansion," the additional work is slated to sustain existing equipment reliability and engine performance during the interim period.  The objective of David and Jerry's efforts on Tuesday will be to minimize downtime and throughput affects, and you will be kept advised for your bulletin posting requirements.  Feel free to contact Jerry with any questions or concerns you may have.

Subject:	Mad Cow Disease


As recently seen on Houston TV, BSE
or Mad Cow Disease, is a widespread
concern especially here in Houston
because of the world wide participation in
the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

Please foward this simple yet effective
test to all those who are associated with
or are actual participants in the HLSR.
It is believed that this act may raise confidence
levels and eliminate unwarranted histeria.

Thank you very much.

This is the new company the TW people set up.  They set it up as subsidiary of TW.  Moran is okey with that.

Diane,

I have all the parent volunteers for the zoo trip lined up.  Do you need anything else for the trip, i.e. juice boxes, etc.?  Let me know and we will have it for you.

I think we really need to have this meeting.  We have some issues we need to discuss.  I have had a tough time getting these people together.  Do both of you need to attend the other meeting?

Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss TW maintenance scheduled for this year.  We would like to discuss when the maintenance will be, the duration, and what will be done.  Please be prepared to discuss any savings we will have from the plan for maintenance that will not have to be done because of our planned expansion (capital and expense.)  We will be meeting on Monday, February 26 at 3:00.  I will send out the location later today.  

Thanks

I heard from the Keltings....that would love to have dinner on Sunday. Sorry
we could not make the Rodeo. That would have been fun. Do we need to make
reservations at Lucinda's? What time shall we go? Jake got on Barry Loder's
soccer team. It was a strange deal. I will tell you about it Sunday or give
me a call when you get a chance.

Shouldn't Julia White attend this?  After all she is gas control and I think they should be represented.  Should I ask Steve Harris this question?

I am not speaking of capital, only O & M.  I really need a list of all items on the balance sheet for reserves, def. charges etc.  I need to know when they will turn, what they are for and if they are in your 2001 plan. 

thanks

Subject:	Carryovers into 2001

In the 2001 Capital Budget there are no true carryovers.

However, in reality there are dollars that need to be spent on 2000 projects that will finish in 2001.  These will have to be funded with management approval by other identified 2001 projects that won't happen.

Mary,

We have received you SAP Security Request Form.  However, before we continue processing this request, I need you to confirm several PS roles you requested for your.  I noticed you selected the following additional PS roles: FN PS Project Controls Engineer, FN PS Project Budget Controller, and FN PS Master Data Entry with FN IM Capital Budget Controller for yourself.  These roles are considered incompatible roles, because the combinations of the roles should not be jointly assigned to a user, as such would compromise segregation of duties and is considered a business risk.  Do you want me to continue requesting these roles for you?  If so, I would need approval from the Chief Accounting Officer (CAO) of your Business Unit.

Attached below is the SAP Security-Internal Control Guidelines:

 

Please advise.

Thank you,
SAP Security (Eva)

Judy should have been listed as CP17 in the PRC.  Her bonus shuld have been $5,600 which falls in the low range of the level for someone ranked a 3.  Please take care of this for me.

1999 = 9,182 Bbtu/d
  2000 = 9,130 Bbtu/d

Decline due to Northern Natural Gas lower south end volumes and lower offshore volumes.  Lower volumes does not necessarily mean lower revenues.  NNG's revenues are over 85% fixed.  The south end volumes have a very low transport rate as well.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Given that we're only looking for expense data and capital expenditures, and given that the tax data is not relevant to us, do we still have to wait until the 8th workday to receive the file?  Assuming no expense accruals, wouldn't our data be complete after the AP close?

FI close is the 8th workday after the Tax file comes back in.  I am assuming that you would not want to pick up any topside adjusting entries until they have hit FI which would be in the following month if the process is followed correctly.  Is the 8th workday sufficiant?

I'd like to have the information as soon as it is available each month.  I don't know what the regular close schedule is so I don't know when it would be safe to extract the data and be sure that you have the entire month's activity.  Our expense close is on the fifth workday so I'd like to aim for  a date as close to there as is possible.

I'll take care of it for you.  I have to follow up on your ID and the job scheduling anyway.  Is there a certain day this will run each month? 5th workday perhaps?

Karl,

Here is a file with December's data from our QA environment.  The program that produces this data will be in production later today, so I'll get you a file from PR1 then.  I had to zip it up because it was too big to deliver.  I'll set you up with an userid and password so you can pick these up off our interface server once it is scheduled in production.

I'm now settled in London.  If you need to reach me, I'm at 783-4269 (trunk+34269).

Thanks,
Shawn

Welcome back.  All the statistical data is on the Investor relations website.  I don't have an extra one.  They are in the kitchen on 49.   Investor relations drafts that supplement and has in the past worked with me to get any data they don't already have and to review the content.

Hi Tracy!

How are things going?  I'm slowly getting back in the groove!

I am currently working with the Annual Report writer on the ETS portion of the book.  Do you know who drafts the copy for the Enron statistical report?   Also, may I get a copy of the 1999 statistical report from you?

Thanks for your help.

Gina

I will be in Houston on Wednesday, February 7th.  I would like to meet with you or your representative sometime in the Morning (I suggest 9:00 to 11:00).

Please let me know as soon as possible so we can book a room.

I would rather we wait until the funtional income statements are complete.  I need to review with Rod and we will have some minor adjustments to make.  I will set up a meeting when we are ready.  It will probably be towards the end of next week.  We can also discuss the quarter forecast

Subject:	Re: Transition Issues   





 Dana Jones and I met with Steve Kleb last week for about 3 hours to go over the NNG Earnings model.  It was somewhat overwhelming  and I could easily see how it could absorb one or more full time equivalent.  I think there is still a great deal that is undefined right now regarding the amount of effort required to keep that model updated.   Some observations/comments.:
Who will take the lead on updating the earnings model for actual?  Is this more of an Accounting responsilbility than Planning ? .  From talking to Steve Kleb its pretty clear that a significant amount of work is involved in getting actual accounting entries at an account level and splitting it into separate business events.
Depreciation - Will Property Accounting take the lead in all aspects of the depreciation.  My impression is that this would be a change from  historical responsibilities.

OTHER QUESTIONS:

Who are the experts on these items?
Carrying charges 
Trackers
Other Income
Taxes


What are the deadlines for reporting legal entity and functional IBIT ( I assume the first quarter forecast is the next one)

I will be in Houston on  1/30 and hoping that we could get together for a couple of hours.  I am hoping we can start defining deadlines and deliverables for our respective groups.  

Please let me know  if you are available on Tuesday 1/30

Danny,

The attached below is where we will be for margins.  This is what we talked about last week.   The other expenses associated with commercial seem to be flat to plan.   I do not have anything else for you at this time.  I should have something by tomorrow and I will send to Julie.

Subject:	CORPORATE ALLOCATIONS - REVISION TO FINAL

Of course, shortly after my previous email, there were a few changes in the allocations, so please refer to the file attached here.  The changes were to Cost Centers:

100034 - Health Center
100141 - Body Shop
100142 - Employee Recreation

The changes were, for the most part, very minor.

Thanks,
Steve

I was hoping to find out the team colors before odering practice shirts.  Do we know what they are?

What a great group of kids! All 11 kids showed and gave a great effort. 

3 items to address: 

      1. Practice each Saturday has now been changed to 9am not 9:30. Same  
Location. Please show this Saturday at 9 so that we can start on time. 

      2. Please fill out and bring your child's medical release this  
Saturday if you haven't already. 
       
      3. Please contact Tracy (Team Mom) about ordering a practice jersey if  
she doesn't contact you first. 

P.S. I know Tracy is planning a fun team get together for the parents and  
kids soon so if anyone has suggestions, now is the time! 

       Thanks everyone, Cliff Lee Roberts

I will let you know when I have the company set up in SAP (the accounting system).  You can still do business, I just can't record any transactions.  This should only take one week.

Lillian, as I mentioned on the phone today, on the form I sent you I erroneously designated Mavrix as a subsidiary of Transwestern Pipeline Company.   Mavrix should actually be a subsidiary of Enron Transportation Services.  Mavrix has not yet done any business as a new entity.  Please make the necessary corrections as soon as possible, and let me know if you need further information.

Thank you!

Enclosed is the January property tax billing for EOTT. Please forward this billing to the correct EPSC accounting employee so it can be billed to EOTT. The Enron Corp property tax RC is Co/ 011 / 100029 and should be credited to account # 52507300.

Hopefully, this process meets with your approval.

Karl Jackson is at EOTT.  They have access to SAP in order to retrieve data for Co 1195.  Can you let him know when he can extract data?  We need to see it they want us to continue to send them a bill for Co 1195 (bill for all CASH spent).  We also need to discuss you guys sending an invoice for interest.

Thanks

I'd like to have the information as soon as it is available each month.  I don't know what the regular close schedule is so I don't know when it would be safe to extract the data and be sure that you have the entire month's activity.  Our expense close is on the fifth workday so I'd like to aim for  a date as close to there as is possible.

Karl,

I'll take care of it for you.  I have to follow up on your ID and the job scheduling anyway.  Is there a certain day this will run each month? 5th workday perhaps?

Who will be the contact for getting the January 2001 file?  Assuming successful testing of the December data, I would like to have the January data next week.  We are scheduled to close expenses for the month of January on Wednesday Feb. 7 and would like to be able to interface the SAP file on that date.  (Not sure who's question this is, but when all else fails, I usually call Shelia.)  Thanks
Karl

Karl,

Here is a file with December's data from our QA environment.  The program that produces this data will be in production later today, so I'll get you a file from PR1 then.  I had to zip it up because it was too big to deliver.  I'll set you up with an userid and password so you can pick these up off our interface server once it is scheduled in production.

I'm now settled in London.  If you need to reach me, I'm at 783-4269 (trunk+34269).

Thanks,
Shawn

I think everything is working for the Valentine's Day party. Julie backed
out on the activity, but Robin Burks and Lorraine Lewis are going to
oversee it. There is one problem though. The craft needs to be picked up
and paid for on Thursday morning after carpool in the cafeteria. Both Robin
and Lorraine are working and I will be in Chicago on business. Do you think
you could drop by there?
Thanks,

This unfortunately is true.  We, ETS, have agreed to an amount which is flat to previous years.  The IT has new managment in, primarily Kerry Roper formerly Clean Fuels, to try to fix or actually create a billing system similar to what we had.  Rod and Steve Hotte have been involved in this.  At this point in time, there is not a better alternative.

Hello, Tracy!    I am curious (and somewhat concerned because they are ALWAYS overcharging me for items I don't have or don't use!) about Paige's second paragraph.   Are her statements true?    And if so, who is going to "police" this to make sure that we are actually getting what we're paying for?

Subject:	Billing Update

Hi Cindy,

Looks like we've gotten to the bottom of the billing issue. The IT billing group is going to refund you $360.00 for erroneous charges over the last year. I had them audit your bill, and they sent me a list of the things that shouldn't have been billed in the first place, and this is the amount you are due. You should notice it on your January bill. Please let me know if you do not see this (you'll probably get the bill in Feb.)

Secondly, the billing system is being changed as of Feb 1. Now that we are using the SAP system, you will no longer receive an itemized bill. All IT charges will be sent to the business unit, at a pre allocated/predetemined amount. This amount was agreed to by all business units. Basically everyone will be billed a single amount for all IT usage, and the Business Unit will be charged, not the individual.

The only things you will be billed for are as follows:
Long distance charges
Market Data Application charges

These things can actually be traced back to the individual(s).

This should make life much simpler.

I think Mike was referring to the revised time table that we discussed in the last upload meeting.  We were going to have all templates uploaded by the 15th, then work with Lee to schedule running the plan assessments on the 20th, etc.  You had mentioned that you would publish the target dates after talking to Lee.

Elaine forwarded the functional IBIT statement (sent by James W)  to me today.  I was wondering if we could now meet  for a couple of hours to discuss the transition issues.  I will be in Houston on Wednesday, February 7th.  I would like to meet with you or your representative sometime in the Morning (I suggest 9:00 to 11:00).

Please let me know as soon as possible so we can book a room. 

Thanks

I would rather we wait until the funtional income statements are complete.  I need to review with Rod and we will have some minor adjustments to make.  I will set up a meeting when we are ready.  It will probably be towards the end of next week.  We can also discuss the quarter forecast

Thanks

Subject:	Re: Transition Issues   





 Dana Jones and I met with Steve Kleb last week for about 3 hours to go over the NNG Earnings model.  It was somewhat overwhelming  and I could easily see how it could absorb one or more full time equivalent.  I think there is still a great deal that is undefined right now regarding the amount of effort required to keep that model updated.   Some observations/comments.:
Who will take the lead on updating the earnings model for actual?  Is this more of an Accounting responsilbility than Planning ? .  From talking to Steve Kleb its pretty clear that a significant amount of work is involved in getting actual accounting entries at an account level and splitting it into separate business events.
Depreciation - Will Property Accounting take the lead in all aspects of the depreciation.  My impression is that this would be a change from  historical responsibilities.

OTHER QUESTIONS:

Who are the experts on these items?
Carrying charges 
Trackers
Other Income
Taxes


What are the deadlines for reporting legal entity and functional IBIT ( I assume the first quarter forecast is the next one)

I will be in Houston on  1/30 and hoping that we could get together for a couple of hours.  I am hoping we can start defining deadlines and deliverables for our respective groups.  

Please let me know  if you are available on Tuesday 1/30

Traci,

As I'm sure you are aware, Corp has moved up the filing of their 10-K to Feb. 16th.  We must have all of our audit work (with the exception of some post-10K items) completed by this date, including our 10-K review and our normal quarterly review.  I am in the process of sending out PBC requests for items we will need in order to finish our work.  Items pertinent to your group are listed below.  Note that these items are PBCs we normally receive from you each quarter.  

EOTT Calculation for 4th Qtr earnings release (we have already discussed this item)
ETS Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 12/31/00
ETS Consolidated Income Statement for 4th Qtr '00 YTD (we need the updated statement)
ETS Cash Flow Squeeze (3rd Qtr schedules are attached for your reference)
    

Please let me know if you have any questions and if there will be any significant delays in obtaining these items.  We would like these items as soon as they are available.  Thanks Traci.

Please review the attached schedule (the tab that shows first only).  This is what I want to give to the Commercial VPs and Danny.  

Tracy, I will need your numbers please when you can get them to me.  Tracy, I took your Plan from the schedules James compiled.  Let me know if your Plan has changed too.

Steve/Dana:  please review to see if I have grouped it the way you want.  I put the 0.1 plug in 4th QTR in Margins.

The main concern is that we won't have a schedule of when we are going to be performing the maintenance yet because that meeting won't be taking place until Tuesday. Since we weren't aware of your meeting until today, we had arranged for the Field people to be here on Tuesday. sj

Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss TW maintenance scheduled for this year.  We would like to discuss when the maintenance will be, the duration, and what will be done.  Please be prepared to discuss any savings we will have from the plan for maintenance that will not have to be done because of our planned expansion (capital and expense.)  We will be meeting on Monday, February 26 at 3:00.  I will send out the location later today.  

Thanks

We really don't want too many people at the meeting.  I am afraid the room will be overflowing.  Could you send Caroline and either Tony or Amy?

This year we will be looking at the income statement on a functional basis rather than a legal entity basis.  As such, it is important the you and/or your functional unit coordinator (BUC) attend these meetings.  Your BUC should be meeting with you prior to these meetings to review your numbers.  We sent a planning calendar out last week which shows when these meetings are scheduled.  You do not need to attend the pre-meetings.  

Our first meeting with Stan for the first quarter is on Friday, February 23 at 3:30 in 49C2.

Please let me know if you did not receive the calendar or could not find it on the intranet.

John,

Per our conversation......

Once HR moves these employees from payroll 0584 to payroll 0012 they will be out of ETS's jurisdiction.  It stands to reason when these people are moved they will be in a new ENA cost center .    It would be helpful to know who these employees are.

Please do whatever needs to be done to facilitate this.  Let me know if I can help. We want to be sure that those people start hitting0012 instead of 0584.  Thanks.

Re: Trailing costs, post HPL sale (hopefully minimal):

>From a practical point of view, I believe its likely charges will continue to "hit" 584.  Please expense.
If at some future time these trailing costs can be recovered from somewhere else in Enron - then, that will be good!
I'm not interested in retaining a deferred debit on this company, waiting for that reimbusement to happen.
Comments?

Effective 2/16/01, approximately 65 employees will move over to HPL Co. 0012.  Please have Corporate and ETS charges to Co. 0584 stop as soon as possible as we will not be able to charge them to ENA.  These should be charged instead to Co. 0012.

Karen, if you have any specific comments on this please let me know as soon as possible.

We've mapped out a strategy in each of these areas, set deliverables and ex=
pect to accomplish a lot while our BU reps are with us from Feb. 20th to 28=
th.

Data Warehouse Project Update

The cost reporting pilot has been built by Beverly Fennessy and the technic=
al team based on the design Li Chan has specified based on your input from =
the initial interviews, followups and several cost reporting workshops she =
has sponsored in the last month.

The pilot will be a mini-cost reporting button, using a small subset of act=
ual financial data from SAP-CO (one BU, three months of data), and showing =
only the cost center information (not project info).  It is designed to tes=
t this solution's (Acta/Oracle/Business Objects) ability to:

1.=09extract data from SAP using Acta,
2.=09report data using a team structure,
3.=09develop usable, presentable and technically efficient "canned reports,=
" and
4.=09provide users an ad-hoc query tool for reporting and analysis not cove=
red by canned reports.

The BU reps need to become familiar with the pilot, and all of our intervie=
w participants are invited to see the pilot and evaluate the tool.
We'll have a questionnaire for your comments and suggestions, which we will=
 incorporate into the development of the actual cost reporting button.  The=
re's a distribution list at the end of this memo - if you know of someone i=
n your group who should attend, please invite them.

 Assuming no significant changes are identified in the user review of the p=
ilot, we expect at least a portion of the cost reporting from the data ware=
house to be rolled into production by the end of April.  So be sure to voic=
e your input!

The second part of the warehouse will be cash reporting.  Steve Frazier is =
the BU rep leading this effort, with Mike Deville from Corp Reporting and S=
usan Bellinghausen from the ISC providing input.  We are working on both di=
rect and indirect cash flow (historical) and trying to determine the best w=
ay to source the data.  We'd like to get it from SAP since that's where we =
can get the most detail, with the Treasury workstation as the source for ma=
nual wires not yet input into SAP.  However, Susan's group has told us that=
 the current SAP design won't allow us to use the Cash Budget Management mo=
dule since that information doesn't tie to FI (due to differences in value =
date and posting date).  Therefore, we're looking at what SAP design change=
s might be needed.

The next step will be earnings, which will expand cost reporting by bringin=
g in gross margin, other income, interest expense, minority interest and ta=
xes.  We're hoping to be able to tie into the Energy Ops Project Enlighten =
(data warehouse) as a source of gross margin data for wholesale operations.

We envision that the counterparty reporting button will also interface with=
 other Enron warehousing efforts, such as Global Counterparty.

A significant objective of the warehouse is to provide ad hoc reporting, so=
 we will be looking at the data behind the reporting buttons and determinin=
g which other information should be transferred into the warehouse in the e=
arly phases.  Our strategy is to place only the information that is most re=
quested into the warehouse in the early phases, but to design the warehouse=
 to be flexible enough to allow additional fields to be transferred in over=
 time.

Budgeting and Forecasting Tool

In our interviews, many people expressed an interest in an automated planni=
ng tool.  We have looked at three products - SAP's SEM, Hyperion's Planning=
 and Adaytum's ePlanning. Some of you attended a demo of Adaytum last week.=
 We like because it seems to have the most functionality and  two Enron BUs=
 already use it (Europe and EBS).  We want to be able to plan for earnings =
as well as cash forecasting and projected balance sheets, with these number=
s feeding the warehouse so that our reporting could include both actuals an=
d plan or forecast.  We'd like to hear any thoughts you have on how you thi=
nk your BU would use a tool such as this.

We're evaluating the valuation proposition now and expect to can make a rec=
ommendation at Rick's February 27 staff meeting. =20

Susan Helton and James Weitekamp are working on this effort.

Close Process

Howard Selzer is leading the initiative to shorten the close process.  He i=
s gathering close calendars from each BU and is talking with each group abo=
ut possible opportunities to squeeze time out of the schedule.  He will als=
o focus on topside entries (after the 8th workday) to determine how to elim=
inate the need for these entries.  Glenn Kobes will provide the tax perspec=
tive.

Knowledge Sharing

Joe Darensbourg is preparing a plan to share best practices among groups.  =
He is also spearheading the Global Accounting Intranet site, which is one o=
f the media we can use.  A Web Advisory Team has been formed so that each B=
U will have input into how we can best communicate using this site (still w=
aiting for ETS and Europe to appoint representatives to this team).  Ideas =
for knowledge sharing include soliciting tips to be reviewed by the Web Adv=
isory Team and then posted to the intranet site, forming user groups in coo=
peration with the ISC (ETS has groups already in place), setting up a forum=
 to ask questions of other users (either as part of eThink or separately) a=
nd encouraging participation in the Houston ASUG (SAP user group).  We'll w=
ant to coordinate with the ISC's efforts to avoid duplication (they have FA=
Qs on their web site).

Alternate Hierarchies

Caroline Lothian is working to compare and document how the each BU uses al=
ternate hierarchies for reporting. This specifically addresses team reporti=
ng, but also includes anything other than the legal rollup.  A common desig=
n for team report hierarchies is necessary to build canned reports in the d=
ata warehouse, since we expect you will want to include data at drill-down =
levels such as BU, line of business, team, profit center and cost center. B=
eyond a team hierarchy, we're really looking to share best practices rather=
 than build a common standard.

Number of Entities and Cost Objects

Currently we have about 1,900 legal or accounting entities and nearly 200,0=
00 cost objects in SAP.  As far as we know, this is the largest number amon=
g all of SAP's customers.  We want to be proactive in controlling these num=
bers before they have the possibility of bringing our systems to their knee=
s.  In addition, the large number of entities and cost objects result in ex=
tra costs related to tax compliance and accounting maintenance, as well as =
the intangible costs related to higher complexity.  Jill Erwin is heading a=
n initiative to first find out how the BUs use various cost objects and whe=
ther there may be a way to simplify their use, and then to identify ways to=
 ensure that new entities and cost objects are set up only when that is the=
 best way to accomplish Enron's objectives.

Training and Change Management

In our interviews, we heard about some problems that may be able to be reso=
lved through specific training.  We will also need training on the new tool=
s and initiatives that will be implemented in Project Sunrise.  It is also =
important for us to continue to communicate with various accounting groups =
as to what Project Sunrise is doing so that we can ensure that we provide w=
hat users really need.  Madeline Chan and Dave McEllin are taking the lead =
on what approach we should take on training.  We have also spoken with the =
Change Management team in the ISC (under Andy Lawrence), who has agreed to =
provide direction and resources as well as help ensure that together we are=
 providing seamless service to our users.
=20
Other Issues

Other areas that we intend to address in Project Sunrise include the automa=
tion of buckets and e-schedules, balance sheets by profit center, intercomp=
any issues and foreign currency issues.  In addition, we working with Susan=
 Bellinghausen and Rick Boehm (ISC) to provide better reporting related to =
payroll distribution and labor distribution.

As you can see, this is a very broad project, and we want to be sure each B=
U is properly represented.  If you'd like to offer additional resources to =
Sunrise, either in general or related to a specific initiative, please call=
 Mark at x57193 or Jan at x33260.  Attached is the mailing list.

Attached is a file which contains the IT Infrastructure 2001 charges split by pipeline.  You will note I have added two line items: Telephone direct and Market Data direct.  These represent charges which will be billed based on actual usage and will post to the applicable cost center(s) which incurred the usage to the EIS general ledger account.  The numbers reflected in the attached file for these items are our estimate only.  If you would like to plan a different estimate, that is your call for your BU.  The remaining line items are for the items which will be billed via an SAP assessment based on the agreed plan amounts.  Please contact Kerry or me if you have questions.

Thanks,
Elise

I would think what you are charging should include benefits and payroll taxes as they are part of employee expenses.  I don't think there is a way in SAP to stop that from happening unless it is a manual entry.

Subject:	Mark Up Rate

 		


Elaine:

As discussed earlier,  the cost center accounts will have to be programmed such that only the Labor Cost move from the Cost Center out to the project.  It is my understanding that Labor Costs at ETS is defined as Base Salary plus Benefits/Burden/Taxes, and therefore, these costs follow with the base labor.

When we define a markup rate in the general E&C business,  the markup is always on the base labor only.  I am asking that you also freeze the transfer of Benefits/taxes/Burdens so that our markup rate will be correct.

Thanks,
Greg

I think everything is working for the Valentine's Day party. Julie backed
out on the activity, but Robin Burks and Lorraine Lewis are going to
oversee it. There is one problem though. The craft needs to be picked up
and paid for on Thursday morning after carpool in the cafeteria. Both Robin
and Lorraine are working and I will be in Chicago on business. Do you think
you could drop by there?

David,

I can set these up but I just need direction on how to do it.  I've never set anything up in the Planning module.  Plus, I guess I need assurance that no one else is setting these up so we don't have a duplication of efforts.

Who can walk me through one?

If you want me to setup the plan cycles for the NNG and TW benefits, payroll taxes and incidental distributions I will.  Maybe I was supposed to without me realizing it.  If so let me know what Actual cycles are in use for these allocations.

Subject:	Re: Plan distribution cycles   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

David,

No one has told me to set up any cycles for plan.  From the meetings, I was under the impression that planning was supposed to copy all cycles and I was just running them.  Is Planning only setting up the fixed distribution cycles and expecting me to set up benefits, taxes, incidentals, and residuals?  Because no one has told me to do anything with those.  If I am expected to do just that, then someone will have to show me what to do as I haven't worked with plan as of yet.  Plus, I think this will have to be made clear to others because I don't know if the other accountants know about this also.

Je

I have assumed you will be creating the plan distribution cycle for incidental expenses for NNG and TW cost centers.  Is this correct?

I was not aware that you were having  problems.  This is the first I have heard of them.  I do not know Cliff Jackson and I am unable to control his actions.  I am not even sure if he works for ETS.   In the future,  if you are having problems, please contact someone in my department, Judy Lin, Mary Botello or James Weitekamp.   Please provide me with a complete list of the things you need and we will be more than happy to work with you.

Subject:	Reports


If these are reports (Property and EIS) that I can get from my computer then I need to know how to get them.  If they are reports that are to be sent to me, I don't understand why I am not getting them.  I did get the EIS report but the RC for Gina Taylor, Kimberly Nelson, and Alma Martinez also include Dave Schafer, Lisa Costello, and Jerry Harkbreaker.  I sent it back to Cliff Jackson and asked him to revise the people names on that RC.  I have not heard back from him.

I need some answers.

Tracey, it is almost time for the February reports and I have not gotten the Property Report or the Report that gives me the budget and actual figures for January.  I know these are monthly.  I don't know why it is so hard to get them but if I don't get some response this week, I am going to Rod Hayslett.


I am getting flack so I am passing it on.

Yes, the one we've all been waiting for... Darwin Awards 2000. They have  
finally been released! 

For those not familiar with the Darwin Award,  It's an annual honor given 
to the person who provided the Universal human  gene pool the biggest 
service by getting killed in the most extraordinarily  stupid way. As 
always, competition this year has been keen again. Some  candidates 
appear to have trained their whole lives for this event!  

DARWIN AWARD CANDIDATES 
1. In September in Detroit, a 41-year-old  man got stuck and drowned in 
two feet of water after squeezing head first  through an 18-inch-wide = 
sewer 
grate to retrieve his car keys.  

2. In October, a 49-year-old San Francisco stockbroker, who "totally =  
zoned 
when he ran," according to his wife, accidentally jogged off a =  
100-foot-high 
cliff on his daily run. 

3. Buxton, NC: A man died  on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had dug 
into the sand caved in as he  sat inside it. Beach goers said Daniel = 
Jones, 
21 dug the hole for fun,  or protection from the wind, and had been = 
sitting 
in a beach chair at  the bottom Thursday afternoon when it collapsed, 
burying him beneath 5 feet  of sand. People on the beach, on the outer 
banks, used their hands and  shovels, trying to claw their way to Jones, 
a resident of Woodbridge, VA,  but could not reach him. It took rescue 
workers using heavy equipment almost  an hour to free him while about 200 
people looked on. Jones was pronounced  dead at a hospital. 

4. In February, Santiago Alvarado, 24, was killed in  Lompoc, CA, as he 
fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he  was 
burglarizing. Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in  
his mouth (to keep his hands free) rammed into the base of his skull as  
he hit the floor. 

5. According to police in Dahlonega, GA, ROTC  cadet Nick Berrena, 20, 
was stabbed to death in January by fellow cadet  Jeffrey Hoffman, 23, who 
was trying to prove that a knife could not  penetrate the flak vest = 
Berrena 
was earing. 

6. Sylvester  Bridal, JR, 26, was killed in February in Selbyville, Del, 
as he won a bet  with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded 
with four bullets  into his mouth and pull the trigger. 

7. In February, according to police  in Windsor, Ontario, Daniel Kolta, 
27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a  head-on collision, thus earning a 
tie in the game of chicken they were  playing with their snowmobiles. 

DARWIN AWARD HONORABLE MENTIONS  

1. In Guthrie, Okla, in October, Jason Heck tried to kill a millipede =  
with 
a shot from his 22-caliber rifle, but the bullet ricocheted off of  a = 
rock 
near the hole and hit pal Antonio Martinez in the head,  fracturing his 
skull. 

2. In Elyria, Ohio, in October, Marty Eskins,  attempting to clean out 
cobwebs in his basement, declined to use a broom in  favor of a propane 
torch and caused a fire that burned the first and second  floors of his 
house. 

3. Paul Stiller, 47, was hospitalized in  Andover Township, NJ, in 
September, and his wife Bonnie was also injured, by  a quarter-stick of 
dynamite that blew up in their car. While driving around  at 2 AM, the 
bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the  window to see 
what would happen, but they apparently failed to notice that  the window 
was closed. 

4. TACOMA, WA - Kerry Bingham, had been  drinking with several friends 
when one of them said they knew a person who  had bungee-jumped from 
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the middle of traffic.  The conversation = 
grew 
more heated and at least 10 men trooped along  the walkway of the bridge 
at 4:30am. 
Upon arrival at the midpoint of the  bridge they discovered that no one 
had brought a bungee rope. Bingham, who  had continued drinking, = 
volunteered 
and pointed out that a coil of  lineman's cable lay nearby. One end of  = 
the 
cable was secured  around Bingham's leg and the other end was tied to the 
bridge. His fall  lasted 40 feet before the cable tightened and tore his 
foot off at the  ankle. He miraculously survived his fall into the icy 
river water and was  rescued by two nearby fishermen. "All I can say," 
said Bingham, "is that God  was watching out for me on that night. 
There's just no other explanation for  it." Bingham's foot was never 
located. 

AND NOW, FOR THE WINNER:  

1. PADERBORN, GERMANY - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt  
fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more  
than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged up =  
pachyderm 
finally let fly - and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds  of poop! 
Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give  the 
ailing elephant an olive oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on =  
him 
like a dump truck full of mud. "The sheer force of the elephant's  
unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he =  
struck 
his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued  to 
evacuate his bowels on top of him," said flabbergasted Paderborn police  
detective Erik Dern. With no one there to help him, he lay under all  
that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and during =  
that 
time he suffocated. "It seems to be just one of those freak  accidents 
that happen."

Blue, white, and orange are the colors.  I think blue or orange would be  
good. Cliff and Lee will commit to one apiece.    Also you may want to call  
all the parents about the practice shirts and remind them of the changed  
practice time this Saturday which starts at 9am. Thanks Tracy!   CLR

Attached is an explanation of the revised capital charge that will be used for 2001.  It is substanially different from the methodology used in prior years and will be applied only on at the business unit level.

The 2001 Plan will be restated to include the revised capital charge.  The restated plan format file will be due on February 24.  We will send a template for calculating the plan capital charge next week.

The actual capital charge for January will be booked in February business.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Subject:	Re: HPL Operations   

I need to make a clarification.  Those Corporate and ETS charges which are headcount driven should be the only ones to stop being charged to Co. 0584 and instead go to 0012.  The non-headcount driven charges should continue to be charged to Co. 0584.  On these we can continue to earn a management fee.  Tracy, perhaps we need a sit down and we can identifiy those Corp./ETS charges that we determined are headcount driven.

Barney estimates that any participation of GCO in HPL Operations will end perhaps in June 2001.

oversee it. There is one problem though. The craft needs to be picked up
and paid for on Thursday morning after carpool in the cafeteria. Both Robin
and Lorraine are working and I will be in Chicago on business. Do you think
you could drop by there?
Thanks,
Karen

This year we will be looking at the income statement on a functional basis rather than a legal entity basis.  As such, it is important the you and/or your functional unit coordinator (BUC) attend these meetings.  Your BUC should be meeting with you prior to these meetings to review your numbers.  We sent a planning calendar out last week which shows when these meetings are scheduled.  You do not need to attend the pre-meetings.  

Our first meeting with Stan for the first quarter is on Friday, February 23 at 3:30 in 49C2.

Please let me know if you did not receive the calendar or could not find it on the intranet.

Subject:	Revised Capital Charge for 2001

Attached is an explanation of the revised capital charge that will be used for 2001.  It is substanially different from the methodology used in prior years and will be applied only on at the business unit level.

The 2001 Plan will be restated to include the revised capital charge.  The restated plan format file will be due on February 24.  We will send a template for calculating the plan capital charge next week.

The actual capital charge for January will be booked in February business.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
