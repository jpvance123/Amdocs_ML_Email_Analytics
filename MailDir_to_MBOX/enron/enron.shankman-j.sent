Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 07/2001




Highlight

The cape market is still rising, but very gently.  Owners are still quite 
concerned about the year as a whole and are actively seeking coverage.  We 
spend much of last week covering all our short positions thru to May.  Plan 
is to sit back for a couple weeks and then sell short again for Q2, Q3 and Q4 
if feasible.  

We struck a deal last Friday with Cetragpa ( Pierre's ex co. ) by which we 
agreed a collar on the RBCT/Rotterdam route for 2002/2003.  We bought a call 
at $7.80 and sold a put at $6.80 for 600,000 MT ( this could be valuable 
hedge for the first 2 years of the Gijon Business).

On the panamax front, Pacific market is still relatively active and strong 
while the Atlantic is soft with few grain cargoes from the US Gulf.  We fixed 
last week a contract to supply 3 panamax vessels of coal and Petcoke to 
Aceralia ( Spanish Steel Mill ).

We are also currently seeking freight for our first freight and coal business 
into the US east coast ( Thanks to the US coal guys ) on a Belted self 
discharge handy max to load in second half of this year.

Regarding MTBE we all are aware it will likely phase out over the next 2/3 
years BUT we are a producer of 15,000 bpd from our company owned gulf coast 
plant. We also have several years left on our MTBE marketing agreement with 
Dubai Natural Gas Company. As a producer we are in an Ideal position to make 
markets in gulf coast MTBE. While the production facility was not a good 
business for Enron (and has been mostly written off) MTBE Trading has been 
and continues to be a good business. I would assume that the plant is also 
now making profits with the capital expense written off.

Enron is the major underwriter of a very unique and INNOVATIVE exhibit at the 
Museum of Fine Arts ... Star Wars:  The Magic of Myth.   It will be on 
display from March 11 - June 24, 2001 and we're really excited about it!  We 
know that there are going to be a variety of ways to involve the business 
units, employees and our external customers, and therefore we are asking you 
to participate on a steering committee to make sure that we leverage this to 
Enron's maximum potential.   Your expertise is needed!

Our kick-off meeting will be Monday, October 16th at 3 p.m.  in 4C2.  I will 
explain the exhibit in further detail at that time.  Please let me know if 
you are able to attend.  Cookies will be served ... 

Thanks in advance for your help in what I am certain will be a fantastic 
collaboration between Enron and the Museum of Fine Arts!

Jeff,
Great to meet you this morning.  I enjoyed learning about the directions
that you have Enron moving in and I look forward to continuing discussions
with you in the new year.  It was also nice to exchange notes with someone
who shares the collecting bug.

Have a good time out west and don't let Michael and Halley con you into more
cold weather fishing.

Thanks for breakfast,

Nat

Jeff,

I need to get resources dedicated to building an intranet site specific to 
Coal, Emmissions and Clean technologies.  West Power built an intranet site 
which proved invaluable in providing fundamental info to the group.  Stu 
Staley is independently working on one in London.  I am also aware gas is 
pushing the same initiative.  Jeff Andrews, a new research hire in our group, 
was hired to develop an intranet site for our group.  I have attached a memo 
he has written which is pretty good considering his limited experience.  I am 
hearing you have initiatives for this started, and would like to get 
resources dedicated to our group as well.

Subject: Bankers Trust / Deutsche downsizing

Jeff- a couple of weeks ago, BT decided to close the Houston office and move 
the 6 people they have to New York - only 1 or 2 will go up there.  I just 
thought I'd tell you my thoughts of the Houston people - I worked with most 
for 4 years.  I know you probably know most of them.

Nigel Patterson- basically trained me - he is the NYMEX trader- worked for BT 
almost 13 years in London, NY, and Houston .  Andy Zipper trained him.  He's 
a good trader - traded currencies, commods (metals, energy).  He could trade 
any of our products- would be especially good at new businesses.  He has been 
in Houston for 4 years and is originally from New Zealand- has a wife and 2 
girls.  Vice President.

Calvin Schlenker- ran Calgary office for 2 years before we shut it in 1997- 
he then took on head of marketing role in Houston - his successes have been 
with producers - being able to exploit lending and hedging.  Most recently, 
he's been trading the nat gas options book.  Very smart guy with good ideas- 
analytical and conceptual- he'd be VERY good with Per's syndication efforts 
or credit derivative initiative.  Knows gas and crude.  He is Canadian- 
ex-wife and 2 kids.  Director.

Steve Provenzano - basis trader - very good contacts in the industry.  Worked 
for MG before BT. He did a lot of marketing with me.  Because he's done both 
trading and marketing, he's got a good edge with customers.  Only has gas 
experience.  He is likely to go to New York but recently got married and has 
a kid on the way.  Director.

Also, Deutsche's two head oil traders in London just quit- but I am not sure 
what they are doing yet- will find out.  That is Janelle Matharoo and Jason 
Thiel (MD and Director)- both been with BT almost 15 years- very good 
traders- always in London.  Jason used to be BT's head gold trader: Janelle 
has also traded metals.

Looks like Deutsche is crumbling on energy- I know they have added a few 
crude traders in NY to service their hedge fund clients (our prospective 
clients) but they have not been able to pull everything together- they are 
loosing all the key people in the business.

I'd like to help in the process of pulling some of these people in if we have 
the desire.

Kind Regards,
Caroline

Gentleman,

We are currently planning a three day trip in early March to provide you with 
the opportunity to visit the coal properties in our portfolio and meet the 
principals.  These include the following:


DPR Holding Company  Chris Cline  Beckley W. Va.
The American Coal Company Bob Murray  Galatia, Ill.
BMR Resources  Richard Gilliam  Benham, Ky.

We plan to use the corporate jet in order to facilitate transportation to 
these garden spots. You will have the option of touring all three operations 
or limiting your visits to a specific mine/principal. Each visit will include 
an underground mine tour.

Bill Giuliani will be coordinating the visits for Enron and will be 
contacting your assistant  this week. Please let us know of your availability 
and particular areas of interest.

Mike

You have been nominated to participate in a video which will be shown during 
the Houston analyst meeting. The objective of the video is to demonstrate the 
depth, diversity and transferability of Enron people. The video will be shown 
early in the day's presentations and will also help set up the theme for the 
day which is Execute and Extend.

I am attaching a briefing note which outlines the questions that we would 
like you to answer on video. In addition I would be grateful if you could 
supply me with a map of your career - ie a list of all the business units and 
associated groups in which you have held positions at  Enron.   

Laura Valencia  - Houston ( Ext 3-6785)  or Fiona Grant - London (Ext 5308)  
will be calling you to  schedule a specific date and time for the shoot.

Many thanks for your help with this video.
If you have any questions please call me on 3-4785.   

Kathryn

Jeff, 

It seems that NYMEX will not make a decision any time soon
or they rejected Tom. I think the latter is the case.

Tom is looking for a trading or origination job with Enron.
I think that we can use his expertise here.

Our old friend Tom Costantino is interested in coming back

Jeff,

I spoke with your assistant earlier this week to get a date where you would 
be available to meet with El Paso regarding current LNG opportunities.  
Unfortunately, Eisbrenner (Senior VP El Paso Merchant Energy Services) was 
only available on Friday October 13th.    

Please come back to me if you can juggle your schedule to join us.  I have 
not invited any of the initial team for the time being.

Thanks
Eric

Hi Jeff,

Thank you so much for coming last Friday and speaking to the students about 
resumes - and everything else!  I think your story was an extremely valuable 
one.  It is good for the students to hear that there is a life outside Wall 
Street, and that their desire for challenge and stimulation can be more than 
fulfilled outside of New York.  It is also good for them to hear that there 
is not one answer to any particular question, and I appreciated that you and 
all of your colleagues pushed back when they pressed you for THE ANSWER.  All 
of us at MBA Career Management can say that until we're blue in the face, but 
when you speak they listen.

Thank you once again for participating.  And please pass on my best regards 
to Evan Betzer.

Best regards,

Sara Simons

Jeff, I enjoyed visiting with you last week.  Subsequent to our meeting, I
did speak at greater length with our physical and derivatives traders.
There are developments which  may well provide for our examining ways to
work together on OTC, risk management and clearing collectively.  How would
you like to proceed?

Subject: gdansk refinery

was asked into a meeting yesterday regarding the eventual purchase of 15-25% 
of the gdansk refinery.
enron has been approached by the polish govt (and the main russian crude 
supplier JNS) to participate in this privatisation.  i have copies of the 
brief for all of you.  further background is that JNS (a smaller russian 
crude supplier) has 85% of the contracts into that refinery (and the Plock 
refinery), and controls the Druzbha pipeline.  they want us to b involved as 
the headline western company.  (the Plock ref people and the JNS people wud 
like to buy the thing but for political reasons cannot until about 5 years 
down the road.)   Therefore, we can structure our deal w/ a put option for a 
later date.
We can view this as a long crack position, with an eventual put in place 
if/when we don't like the deal.
There are other optionality benefits that need to be assessed.  (so far i 
have told them to count the trading angle as 0 profit, so that they don't 
load us up w/ a lot of bs).  We can use the facilities as a terminal.  We can 
just use the infrastructure to re-sell the crude that they get on the 
pipeline.  We can sell the ulsd they make and replace w/ regular diesel.  
Given their power needs they have their own plant but are still short 300 MW, 
so the power people like it.  etc etc.
I have already told them that we did not really want to waste our time 
thinking about this project if the specter of a reuters headline blaring that 
'Enron Buys Polish Refinery' is going to kill the deal from Skilling's 
perspective.  they assure me that they have run it by sheriff and he likes 
the power aspect and the higher profile this wud give us in poland so he is 
favorable towards it, for the moment.  rac will be looking for 20-25% roi, 
which may kill the whole thing anyway.  they have already gotten toxic waste 
indemnity from the govt.

we need to ask questions/poke holes and get as much information as possible 
out of the govt and JNS, because either they will do the deal and throw this 
in our laps, or they might pass on something that wud actually turn out to be 
interesting.  
if everybody wud please read the brief and come up w/ issues to be clarified 
by wednesday next week, i would appreciate it. thx

Subject: lng shipping

jeff
long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

John

We are pleased to confirm today's launch of the following products via EOL:

Ethylene Contract (NW Europe)
Propylene Contract (NW Europe)
HD Polyethylene (German Film)
Polypropylene (German Inj)
Polystyrene (German General Purpose)

In a 2nd roll-out (timing TBC) we are looking to add:

PVC (German Pipe)
LD Polyethylene (German Film)
LLD Polyethylene (German C4)

We are initially offering 6 month and 12 month swaps for each product.

SUMMATION OF EUROPEAN MKT

- market is very conservative and tunnel-visioned, with derivatives as very 
new concept to all players (case of tail trying to wag the dog)

- even though no OTC trades have been done we are looking for the launch to 
act as a magnet for potential counterparties to at least start looking at our 
numbers on a regular basis (personalised letters + PR in industry mags is 
underway).

- Shell / BP are talking of launching similar platform 2001, but Enron only 
company aggressively marketing in Europe (look at 
http://www.eyeforchemicals.com/chem/presentations/hurley.pdf for Shell 
perspective).

- Enron brand is not known to converters/consumers  - profile awareness / 
promotion is continuous process.

- 6mo and 12mo prices are offered, as shorter term we are exposed due to the 
fact we are not in physical mkt.

- spreads are reasonably aggressive, but for hedging purposes all products 
show close correlation to each other and US equivalents.

regards
Rob Brewis

What happened?  

Here's a story...as I was waiting at the bus stop (7:35am) to go to school, a 
lady approached me and asked if I'd make sure her daughter got on a certain 
bus.  The mother was running late for work and could not wait.  I couldn't 
say no...so Nicki (the little girl-10 yrs. old) and I waited for the bus.  It 
was now, 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus.  

On top of  things, I had quiz at 8am.  Which I then realized I missed.  I 
decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own.  I asked her if she 
had any relatives that  would want to know of her whereabouts.  I called her 
grandmother and explained things to her.  Pretty strange...aye. 

A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her, but I 
couldn't do it.  Finally, I told the little girl that she would have to 
accompany me to school (8:30am).  There were only 15 minutes left of class.  
I stayed for the remainder of the lecture. After class we went back to bus 
stop and within minutes her bus arrived.  I told the bus driver where to drop 
her off.  I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure.  And I 
was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe.

We had one of our most successful days on Enron Online today.  In addition to 
the frontline NYMEX look-a-like trades, we did six jet swaps and two heat 
cracks online.  Although it is from a small base, this business continues to 
grow.  This business we are doing is also better than the NYMEX look-a-like 
business in that we are developing a mix of counterparties who are paying the 
bid/offer. Today's counterparties included Valero, Hess, Cargill and Bank of 
America. 

Next week we will launch our NYMEX heat and gas crack products.  Many of our 
counterparties have expressed interest in this product so we believe our 
volumes will continue to grow.

Hi Rick, 

I understand it is hot in Dubai--hopefully it will cool off soon.  On an 
organizational matter, I'm not too comfortable with your creating new org 
charts, and creating a new exec committee, etc.  Please call me next week so 
we can discuss this.

Subject: The Way Forward

Dan, in response to your question yesterday, it should still be possible to 
get a structural ruling from the IRS along the lines that Deutschebank (DB) 
had contemplated.  In that respect, last week's IRS announcement leaves 
things unchanged.

That's the good news.  However, in light of last week's IRS announcement, DB 
is unlikely to be able to get the new ruling that they desired confirming 
Pacificorp's existing letter rulings, which they have told us was critical to 
them.  It would appear then that the Pacificorp deal is a non-starter from 
their perspective, at least based upon the present plan of operations.  Tim, 
is it at all possible that DB would be willing to drop their demand about 
going back for a confirming letter ruling as long as the Pacificorp 
facilities are processing at least some percentage of coal fines with their 
run-of-mine coal, consistently with their existing rulings?  I doubt it, but 
if not, we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to 
do a coal deal with Pacificorp.  I believe that Pacificorp still needs to 
unload their facilities, and they may still be able to leverage off of their 
existing rulings, which are still valid and have not been revoked by the IRS. 

Without a deal with DB, what are our options now?   

First, it is important to recognize that we still have options.  The IRS has 
not killed synfuel.  There has not been any change in the substantive law.  
Last week's announcement was just that -- an announcement of the IRS's point 
of view.  The news is that the IRS is getting out of the business of issuing 
private letter rulings to private taxpayers in the synfuel business, which 
has been an important source of comfort to many investors, but not 
necessarily vital.  Deals get done all the time without the benefit of having 
a private letter ruling from the IRS (generally in reliance on an opinion of 
outside counsel).  We just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks 
like in the absence of getting a new ruling.

One approach would be to follow through with our plans for Pacificorp's 
facilties, meaning we would relocate them, and continue running run-of-mine 
coal, the IRS be damned, and just find an equity player with a greater risk 
profile than Pacificorp.  In short, we would need companies who are willing 
to rely on Pacificorp's existing rulings, period (along with an appropriate 
indemnity).   It seems to me that if the price is right, someone ought to be 
willing to step up.   While the risk is now greater, the potential returns 
are potentially mind-blowing, and an equity player ought to be able to get an 
opinion of outside counsel vouching for the viability of the credits, 
notwithstanding the IRS' current view of the law.  It seems to me that this 
is the only approach that makes sense.

Alternatively, Pacificorp's facilities could revert back to being a pure coal 
fine processing facilities in an atttempt to conform with the IRS's recent 
announcement.  The IRS announcement implicitly endorses facilities that 
process "waste coal fines," so such facilities could still qualify for new 
private letter rulings.  The IRS announcement defines the term "waste coal 
fines" very vaguely, not specifying either the coal size, or what it is that 
makes coal fines properly viewed as "waste" coal fines.  If you think in 
lawyerly terms and try to deconstruct the literal language they use in their 
announcement, I can envision that Enron could synthetically create "waste" 
coal fines by rewriting some of our coal supply contracts with utility 
customers to provide for the sale of only coal of 3/4 inches or greater, 
resulting in a residual category of "unwanted" coal that we could separately 
market to synfuel plants as "waste" coal fines.  In other words, they could 
be fairly described as "waste" insofar as another coal customer specifically 
excluded it from their contract.  In addition, the IRS announcement does not 
require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output, as 
some commontators had feared, which is a helpful development because the 
pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity.  

However, there are real difficulties with this approach.  First, the relevant 
language in the IRS announcement defining "waste coal fines" is not real 
statutory law.  It is basically just an IRS policy statement, meaning that we 
cannot bind the IRS to it.  So the opportunity for gamesmanship over the 
IRS's choice of language is much more limited than it would be if this were 
statutory law.  Also, Price Manford has reported to me that what the IRS 
really has in mind in terms of what is acceptable to them as bonafide waste 
fines is fines from true waste ponds.  Even if the taxpayer can argue over 
the meaning of the term "waste" fines, the IRS can stick to their 
understanding of the term, at least for the sake of deciding whether to issue 
a new ruling.  In short, the IRS may not be willing to give a new ruling 
based on a coal fines facility that does not process the truly 3 or 4% waste 
fines incidental to mining operations.  If you are not going to be able to 
get a new ruling anyway, what's the point of going back to being a coal fine 
processing facility?

But there is another more fundamental problem to the latter approach.  
Pacificorp already has good private letter rulings that bless coal fines 
generally (i.e., not merely "waste" coal fines) as well as run-of-mine coal.  
Why would anyone want to go back to the IRS to get a new ruling that is more 
restrictive than the ones that they already have?  That is truly putting 
value at risk.  

In my view, the best deal for Pacificorp would be to market their existing 
rulings as essentially "above market" rulings, insofar as they go farther 
than the IRS currently allows, giving them a competitive advantage over other 
synfuel operators who never got a ruling.  It seems to me that if they can be 
persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape, 
since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk, then we may 
still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal.

When she was hired, there was no 3rd year analyst program.  She is going to 
be placed in the trading non-rotational program, as well.  In addition, she 
has made well over 1million dollars trading a book on the gas floor, and has 
been made our resid trader.

Jeff,

According to our criteria, Sara is not eligible to be promoted to an 
Associate at this time.  Sara would only have 20 months in the program as of 
3/31/01and does not have the 2 years of relevant commercial experience prior 
to Enron necessary to promote her to the Associate level.  However, Sara 
could be promoted to a 3rd Year Analyst at the mid-year PRC.  

Thank you,

Subject: US Election

We are tracking the poll numbers and trends heading into the election.  Still 
too close to call, but momentum may be swinging back to Gore.

The major tracking polls: Bush Leading in 4, Gore in 1.

       ABC    CNN    MSNBC  Voter  W.Post
Bush   48     49     43     44     47
Gore   46     42     45     40     45


Note that Bush is leading in West Virginia and Louisiana, what should be Gore 
states, but Gore is leading in Florida and Ohio, two "must-win" Bush states.  
Gore is trending favorably in large vote-rich states including not only 
Florida and Ohio, but also New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well as traditional 
Democratic strongholds such as Minnesota and Wisconsin.  One caveat is that 
today's NYT Florida poll is the flip of yesterday's Florida Sun Sentinel 
Florida poll that showed Bush leading (46-41).  Bush has changed his schedule 
and is on his way to Ohio tonight. 
 
Latest State Polls: "Bad News" for  Both

??? ???   AZ  CO  FL* LA* MI  NJ

Jeff,

We are reviewing the P+ spread option book.    One item of note is that the 
correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from 
what was being used a year ago (see charts below).   I also remember that 
John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.  In fact 
he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not 
allow it, so he was using 0.999.

We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.   If 
you want, Vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day.   Just 
let me know what time would be convenient.

		 Subject: Summary of EES "Bear Trap"

Purpose
To explain the EES strategy for 2001 and how they will deliver on their 
number.

Details
EES has 3 product lines: Global National Outsourcing - Bundled Services 
(Angela Swarz / Mike Mann), Fast Track (Craig Sutter) and Regional Commodity 
(Greg Sharpe / Greg Cordell)
 1. National Accounts
 Part A - Bundled Service
 * This is the full bundled product (DSM, Commodity and Risk Mgmt)
 * Angela Swarz is the team lead
 *They are targetting large commercials (i.e shopping centers, hotels etc). 
 *They are also going aftersome large industrials (i.e. they closed Quaker 
Oats on 1/25)
 Part  B: Midddle Marketing- - Industrial Origination
 * Mike Mann heads this up
 *They are targetting heavy industrials including the Refining, Petchem and 
Chemical industries
 * They sell Risk Mgmt, Commodity etc.......
 * They are making a concerted effort on Ags and Chems
 * Approaching customer at the executive Level
 * Already approached Farmland and IMC
 * Have a deal with Kerr McGee for outsourcing
 2. Fast Track "Boiler Room"
 *Run by Craig Sutter
 * ABC - always be closing-- They have written a script for originators to 
close a deal in 4 calls.
 *They have a computer that generates leads for their new marketing products 
( "ENvest" (Asset capex), ENpower "commodity swaps", Commodity sales  
"ENsomething" and "Entelligence" -
 3. Commodity Sales
 * Greg Sharp and Greg Cordell
 *Have big plans for power in TX
 *Do some gas commodity sales
 *Basically anythinmg smaller than the wholesale load

Impact on EGM
In August 1999, all NAICS (SIC) codes except Pulp and Paper and Steel 
reverted to EES in September 2000. This includes Refining, Petchems, 
Transport, Chemicals, Coal, Ags, etc...They a model "Value Enhancement" that  
shows an itemized account of a customer's VAR by commodity (metals, plastics, 
petchems,
products, gas, power, etc). They planon covering the whole universe of risk 
management. Obviously we need to manage the relationship with EES.

Next Steps:
Meet with Mike Mann. I have his target list. We probably need to see how we 
help them bring business to the EGM books, since they are cross-selling 
everything.

Let me know what you want to do.

Subject: Migration to Windows 2000

Jeff:

 During my assessment of your machine, I noted your current hardware 
configuration:
SP750 with Dual 800Mhz PIII processors
512MB RAM
Matrox Quad video card

We currently do not have hardware in stock that matches these 
specifications.  Our current practice is to prepare a machine that is like or 
better than the machine the customer has currently, then swap that hardware.  
The benefits here are minimal downtime and the ability to switch back to the 
old machine quickly if an application does not work correctly in Windows 
2000.  Because we do not have a machine of equal or greater speed in stock, 
here is what I propose:

Every machine we migrate is Ghosted.  By this, I mean we run a program called 
Ghost which takes a snapshot of the machine in its current state.  This image 
can then be put back on the machine or accessed to retrieve files or other 
data.  I propose we Ghost your existing machine, make a backup copy of that 
image (after verifying it works correctly), then re-use your current hardware 
with Windows 2000.  The risk here is that we cannot go back to Windows NT 
(your current system) as quickly if something does not work.  

If you would like to move ahead with this plan, please let me know.  
Otherwise, we will order a machine with the same specifications, but it will 
take some time to get here.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

-Mike Hernandez

Subject: Garcia Munte / Spain


The situation of this file, which was on the last leg , is suddenly 
worsening.  (cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :  19 million oct 
3rd  / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,  zeroing in november  as 
we have stopped deliveries to GM  - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti 
cargoes direct to the third parties) .
Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where 
combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of 
terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the 
above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to 
be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to 
sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being 
unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic  
inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in 
the early 2000.   
As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name 
(and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more 
documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk 
that a Spanish liquidator contest our position.
We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by 
GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to 
continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and 
stop payments...

GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and 
save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without 
increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for..

We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to 
accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential 
buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC 
Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be 
in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company 
cannot get sold.

Thanks
Michel

Subject: SADAF

You had asked for clarification regarding the status of our SADAF bid and how 
the 501D turbine that Delaney wants may impact us.

Our bid, along with bids from others, are still under evaluation by SADAF.  
We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within 
two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be 
forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA 
negotiations that could take about six months to finish.  Until the PPA is 
signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal.

We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, 
and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed 
with or without this specific turbine.  

Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects.  
However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron  affiliate if there is a 
bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line.

If Delaney has a firm "bird in the hand" he should take the turbine.  
Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want 
to take the turbine.

My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF.

Subject: ARA Coal Mkt Summary

MKT SUMMARY

  Dust is settling after latest supply side incident to hit the market - 
namely the Drummond Force Majeure. What remains now is cif mkt
   which is in backwardisation for Q4 and Q1 01 versus the rest of 2001 but 
where stocks in Rotterdam are at near record highs at around
   2.5 million mt for the end of September. Indeed, utilities and traders 
alike have taken advantage of the weak spot mkt we experienced 
   during August and early September to buy up distressed parcels in ARA and 
play the cash / carry game. This has certainly paid
   dividends as any slack which was in the pipeline has certainly been 
swallowed due to a number of incidents which has restricted
   production/shipments from various geographies. While the whole curve has 
shifted north as a result of early buying interest for 2001
   the backwardisation in the frt curves coupled with above has seen Q4 and 
Q1 prices increase by some $4 over past 6 weeks to
   absolute values at $39 cif ARA - this represents a prm of between 
$0.75-$1.00 over Jan/Dec 01 run. Believe the front end will continue
   to remain tight due to supply squeeze we are feeling and high frt rates 
but going forward into next year we may see some price pressure
   from levels we are today as a consequence of lower frt rates, increase in 
prod'n, synfuel into Europe and weaker continental power prices 
   from the high levels they are today. Control of FOB origin prices through 
continued consolidation in the production side of the industry 
   could put ruin to this and hence we look for opportunities to spread our 
long FOB origin posn into as many geographies as possible. 

SPOT TRADES

Bot one pnmx of Caypa Steam coal from Masefield for December shipment FOB 
Santa Marta at $US 31 basis 11800btu.
Sold 70mmt of chinese material to EVN delivered stockpile for October and

Sold 2 x 15mmt SECA contracts to Glencore for December delivery at $40 Fob 
barge and $40.50 fob barge respectively.


SELLING SIDE

Mission continue to look for La Loma material for December delivery - now 
looking at 2 pnmx 1 into east coast and 1 into hunterston.
Bewag have tender out for 500mmt for 2001
Rheinbraun/Duisbourg combined looking for close to 250mmt Colombian material 
on delivered basis.

Preussen deal. 3 firm pnmx plus 3 options. 
Masefield - offered further pnmx cargo of 11800 material for Q1 delivery at 
$32 FOB Santa Marta.
BBC Trading - 10-15mmt Russian material ex-stockpile Sczcecin to supply our 
bewag commitments.

Likely to be a cape quantity for Q2 delivery.
AES - UK coal for Q4 and Q1 2001.
BHP - 1 June 2001 Cape.


EOL

We are just shy of reaching 500,000mt mark for total volume of tonnage traded 
via EOL with the activity that went on this week. There 
continues to be excellent interest from all sectors of the industry and we 
really need to focus on converting the increasing number
of guest user ID's we are giving out into actual transactions on the system - 
many are still afraid of the technology, many are still ignorant
of how they can utilise the system as a risk management tool and many simply  
don't have the authority - hence we continue to focus
on preaching the word to all and sundry!! Highlight this week was having 
Glencore trade on two occasions and not surprisingly they were 
propping the mkt up on the buy side. We are moving ahead with posting options 
on the SECA contract on EOL.

GAMEPLAN

Current mkt environment has generated healthy buying interest for 2001 and 
with the expectation that we will still see frt rates ease off for 2001
from the high levels today ($9.50 RBCT - ARA Cape) combined with a somewhat 
weaker tone in continental power prices for 01 we are fairly 
keen to hit some of this business at current price levels. We have benefited 
from the current price hike maintaining an overall long position 
but with the lions share of that long being placed in Drummond we must focus 
on securing physical commitments from Drummond for first half 01 
shipments in order to participate in any of this business with peace of mind. 
Hence we continue to look for opportunities to tie up tonnage from
other geographies such as South Africa, Australia, U.S and Russia that will 
allow us the flexibility which adds so much value to our book.

Have extended dlist this week - if you donot wish to receive then please let 
me know and likewise if you would like people
added.

Best Regards
Jez

Subject: Venezuela LNG

Randy- Emilio and I had a vigorous debate today over the content and 
conclusions of the CABC Group's analysis of the questions you asked about the 
political and regulatory situation in Venezuela.  He expressed a number of 
areas of concern, some pertaining to the tone of the paper and others to its 
accuracy.

I acknowledged his concerns and promised to do my best to improve the tone 
and clarify any inaccuracies.  We will revisit with our sources to clarify 
the following issues:

1. Will the new Hydrocarbons Law just address liquid hydrocarbons or will it 
address gas hydrocarbons?  What details are available on the proposed law?
2. If the new law does affect gas, will it in effect overturn the 1999 Gas 
Law?
3.  Will gas tariffs be separate for transportation, distribution, and 
upstream, or will there be a single unified tariff?  Is there a dispute 
between PDVSA and the  Ministry of Mines and Energy on how this should be 
handled?
4. What is the current royalty and tax structure on gas?  Will it be affected 
by the new HydroCarbons Law?
5. What are the current renegotiation dynamics of the Cristobal Colon project 
between the government and foreign operators?

Once we have revisited with sources, I told Emilio that we will be happy to 
correct any subsequent errors.  However, if we reconfirm the information in 
the paper then perhaps the three of us can confer on how to proceed.

This has been a difficult assignment because we are essentially dealing with 
areas that are subject to interpretation and forecasting.  Emilio and I 
disagreed in some areas about the Chavez agenda, while agreeing in others.  
Also, because the HydroCarbons Law has not yet been written, we can only go 
on what sources in country are saying.  Clearly, we have conflicting 
information and will work to clear up the contradictions ASAP.

I suggest we postpone our Thursday meeting until both Emilio and I have time 
to conduct further follow-ups.  As I have said to both you and Emilio, the 
CABC role here is not to take any position on the merits of the deal, but 
rather to answer the specific concerns brought up by RAC.  Hopefully, these 
next steps will resolve the situation in mutually satisfying manner.

RJ

Jeff/ John--I left a voice message  with you re: the attached.

BICC ( formerly known as General Cable)  is one of  EES's key national

manage the  volumetric/price risk associated with  the below commodities. 
They have provided us this information  on a confidential basis. Are these

career path.  Are you interested in bringing in guys like this to EGM, and to 
whom should I direct him if so?

Thanks,
Brad

Clay, get with Nowlan to see who else should be put on this system.  You are 
missing products traders, and others who should be on this system.  Thanks.

Jeff has asked me to get instant messenger so that i can flash fast breaking 
news to all crude traders at once without using email.  I think the best app 
for this is Yahoo Instant Messenger.  Once you have it, please email me your 
screen name or just write to me (mine is clay_seigle) and we'll be ready.

Also, if there are other traders who should be included, let me know.

Thanks

I'd like to know how we purchased the Katz.  Was that outside our budget, and 
in Ken's dining room budget?  Mike and I will get together and address the 
points you bring up below.  Looking forward to our meeting.

Subject: Presentation to Skilling etc.


Mike,
As you know, I have arranged for a meeting on December 6th among the Art
Committee and Jeff Skilling.  I feel that you should run this meeting.  I
would like to accomplish the following:

1) Discuss our Vision for the collection
2) Introduce Ned and Barry
3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings
4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable
5) Discuss the process:  To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the
decision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Vision
and having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)  The
latter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but we
definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed.
Questions right now for you:
1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting?
2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so should
we postpone?  Barry is a "maybe".  Remember they are there to help us shape
a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any
purchasing "mistakes".
3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss it?
Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed list
of potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) so
that we have a Master from which to work.  I will run it by Bonnie McCloud
and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy.
Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we are
considering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to
discuss where his piece might fit in the new building.  I have also placed a
call  Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to
meet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would like
to propose a "water piece" for the circular drive.  You will recall that
Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there.  Eliasson is very
well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow "up" and
wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.  I've asked
his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in
Houston on their next trip.
Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hanging
in 50M.  Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Lea

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 02/2001




Highlight

The cape market continues to slide ever southward with owners unable to 
repeat last done on rates obtained.  Richards bay to Rotterdam rates have 
fallen about $2 in 45 days ( key coal route )  and Brazil to China rates have 
fallen $3 in the same period ( key iron ore route ) which has owners running 
for cargo  coverage.  However charterers smell blood and are not willing to 
enter into freight contracts ( Edf trading and NCSC  are playing spot and so 
are we ).  Even the mighty Bocimar seems unable to turn the tide and are 
offering us cheap rates on the quiet as they keep playing their vessels spot 
and are  being run over.  The average cape rate has lost $ 4200 from its peak 
and hangs around $20,400 presently.  To get cargo contracts for the balance 
of the year an owner has to fix his vessel at around $16,000 to get 
charterers willing to agree.  The downward fall is the result of two 
concurrent market shifts 1- coal shipments into Europe have slowed 2- market 
is predicting that sometime in Q1 2001 , Japanese steel mills will cut back 
on production and reduce their raw material imports.  As a result, you have 
on one side, Japanese vessel owners panicking as they fear that their main 
account ( Japan ) will not need their vessels shortly and you have the 
European owners also worried as they are seeing their utilities postponing 
their coal requirements.  Furthermore, the holiday season in Asia is 
approaching and little activity is predicted for the next few weeks.

On the panamax front, the outlook is still very bleak as you now have about 
two new buildings being launched per week in a market which is currently well 
balanced.  In the spot market, the Atlantic is weak as the grain out of the 
US gulf is slow as the main rivers are frozen upstream and the vessels have 
little to load.  In the east the market is strong as there is a flurry of 
grain activity but in the paper market, February is already traded at a big 
discount to Jan as people predict a quick slowdown in the activity as Asia 
goes on holiday.

On the long term strucutred front, last week we agreed to charter a new cape 
building starting in late 2003 for 10 years with an option for an 11th, 12 
th, 13 th and 14 th year.  Furthermore, we have the option to buy the vessel 
after year 3 at a fixed agreed Japanese yen amount ( if currency goes our 
way, we buy the vessel dirt cheap !!!).  The counterparty in Mitsui, a big 
and financially strong Japanese company.  The deal is still subject a few 
details but we hope to be able to book this deal within the next 5 months 
when the ship building contract will be drawn up.

Also last week we had about 6 banks over a period of three days come to our 
office to discuss possible opportunities in the shipping world and to get 
them to trade on EOL.  Larry Lawyer and Simon Crowe organized the meetings 
and we expect a few of these leads to pay off sometime this year.

Subject: Cement- a new business opportunity?

Jeff:

CALME's HR advised me that there is no match for my skills and experience in 
your business unit.  I spent a great part of my professional career in the 
oil & gas business.  Therefore, I have contacted Mike Brown to see if I can 
bring value to his team.  I have not gotten any response yet.

As I have about three weeks left to find a position within Enron, I would 
like to explore/seek origination opportunities in a totally new area for 
Enron:  Cement.  This industry can be transformed to the new economy and 
given its size, it may well be a significant income generating market for us 
and certainly within a short time another commodity for EnronOnline.

This is new for me but enormously challenging.  I am asking you to give me a 
chance to sell this concept to you at your convenience.  I have enclosed a 
brief resume for your review.

I look forward to meeting with you.  Thanks, Jeff

Did you have any doubt that the best logistics school is  Wharton?  (I think 
they call it transportation sciences, no really).  I'll call up there this

I spoke with Geoff Pollock (Stacey Rosen's cousin) who is the logistics mgr 
at Frigidaire.  He's helping me identify candidates for the transportation

get into their placement office.  Do they have alumni job boards?

Folks:
We interviewed three candidates. One of the three (Tony Hamilton)  seems to 
be a very good fit within the Enron culture and values.
Recommended Next Steps
Vince, Mike and Jeff interview Tony via video conference or avistar

Tony Hamilton Key Strengths
Quick thinker
Good teams skills
Driven - will be able to get the project off the ground quickly
Has a commercial attitude
Sees "the big picture"

Tony Hamilton is available for follow up interviews the first week of January.
Thanks

Can you try to use your amazing persuasion skills on Mauricio - he has an 
Associate offer and came to sell weekend.  He's trying to decide between us 
and ABN Amro (also had a JP Morgan offer, but decided not to take it).  His 
concern is the $10k differential on our signing bonus and $20k differential 
in the guaranteed year end bonus because he wants to pay down his loans.  He 
wants to see if there is anything that we can do.  He feels like Enron is the 
better long term choice, but banking is a better short term choice.

Can you give him a call - 215.732.9989 (home) or 215.432.0183 (cell).

I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete 
for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased 
expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This 
was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece 
of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners 
going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we 
do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.  
Maybe I don't understand it all.

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 49/2000




Highlight

The freight market for cape and panamax size vessels appear to be on the 
verge of a significant downward correction.  The news from Japan and the 
Asian economies as a whole is bleak with fear of more bankruptcies looming 
and low to flat growth projections. Furthermore, the US economy is showing 
strong signs that it has peaked.  As a result, ship owners are openly worried 
about demand for next year and are desperately seeking cargo contracts while 
rates are still attractive.  The cape time charter rate has lost more than $ 
3,000 over the last 3 weeks and Panamaxes have lost $ 1,500.  On the cape 
side, Bocimar is unable to prevent the index sliding even though they still 
control 60 ships ( on Friday index fell 33 pts, single biggest point drop 
ever recorded ) and other owners are fighting for the few spot cargoes still 
unfixed before the Christmas break. 

Of significance, we fixed on subs a four cargo contract with Bao Steel ( one 
of the biggest Chinese steel mills ) that runs into March 2002 from Brazil 
into China and also fixed a a four panamax contract with Adaro from Indonesia 
to Spain, which is on subs until or if Adaro sells the coal into Spain.

JS:
I just met with Chris Gaskill and Kevin McGowan. We are in dire need of 
analysts. I proposed the following and would like your buy-in:
1- A return trip to Wharton to get more finance and engineering grads.
2- An off cycle super Saturday based on the resumes we pull from the 
collection Ted Bland put together.

Thanks

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 51/2000




Highlight

The cape market continues on its downward momentum with this time bunkers ( 
Fuel Oil ) helping the slide as they have lost approx. $30 in the last couple 
weeks and make the costs of running the ships significantly less.  Panamaxes 
have on the other hand, started a slow upward trend.  Most bundits think that 
this latest rise might be the 'dead cat bounce'.  The Japanese buyers and the 
US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks 
while arguing over 'starlink' which is basically genetically modified crops 
while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news 
of resumed shipping.  When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week, 
Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed, and the panamax market 
quickly reversed trend and starting going up.  

With the Christmas season quickly approaching, we expect the market to slow 
down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining 
positions quickly.   This is the last report in 2000.  Have a good holiday 
and see you next year !!!

Subject: systems developments in london

we are working with the systems development group here in london to create 
for the global products trading group a curve spreadsheet and options
calculator (can do cracks spreads and asian options).  the aim is that we can 
have a central site that is accessible to other groups and all 
traders/marketers in this group to facilitate our ability to service customer 
business.  brian hudson is the person who developed this system for the gas 
and power groups here in europe and has been recommened to us by steven 
leppard who heads the IT research department.   Without going into the 
systems history story here I think we are inadequately prepared on this side 
and need to strengthen in this area.  We understand from Steve that in order 
for them to dedicate the resources required for what we are asking they would 
like to take on an additional person that would be partly for our and the 
coal group's acct.  Steve can keep this individual busy with other projects 
so it would not be a full time expense for Global Products.  our excel 
spreadsheets methodology is not stable enough given the increasing 
unreliability of the London servers which keep falling over and thus the 
traders without any pricing tools.  This is what brought about our 
discussions with the IT department to try and improve the present system.

Subject: how to go forward in the oil markets


CUSTOMER BUSINESS - EOL
Jeff - I think your ideas of adding marketing and research analysis to the 
group are good starting points. I don't feel this will increase revenues for 
us in 2001 as our  efforts here are only to win volume from others in a thin 
volume environment.  Eventually the captured deal flow should help the group 
trade from a better knowledge base but for the next year it will require a 
significant recruitment and training effort.   Both the recruitment and the 
teaching process are ones that we need to focus on.  Please let me know what 
you have in mind on the recruitment side and I would like to highlight that I 
feel there are very few people to teach the analysts and associates.  I plan 
on spending an increasing amount of my time working with the younger team 
that I'm assembling in London.   By end October, the London office will have 
5 managers, 4 associates and 1 analyst in our group.  This is a real shift 
from the approach of the past where the focus was on recruiting directors.   
Given our previous track record on recruiting from the outside (about 33% 
success in terms of performing well and acclimating to enron) I think this is 
the right approach but we must realise this is a slower process when we look 
to revenue growth and one that will also require us to shift more focus 
toward teaching. My plan is to put much of the associate resources toward EOL 
marketing initially and see what talents they have for being marketing and 
analysis.  The one analyst joining the group is coming over one of the 
consulting companies in London and I'm putting him in charge of drawing up a 
list of potential customers in every European country.  Please let me know if 
you have any plans of bringing somebody in to organise globally the marketing 
business.  Can't help but feel that we are very marginal in the electronic 
trading of oil and could lose all of our business in the near future.  Having 
seen the ICE demo I would prefer that system of ours because of volume.  This 
is a complaint that I have heard from many traders regarding the use of our 
system.  The challenge is how can we put up more volumes, more markets, and 
tighter 2 ways to convince more people to trade with us and not get run 
over.  What do we know about the ESPEED system and what they are going to 
have.  I saw a Reuters story saying they were launching Oct 2nd with Koch, 
Dynergy, Entergy, Willams, and a few others.  Are we thinking about trying to 
join up oil markets with either of these two sites and what are the plans if 
we do begin some of the small customer basis we do have?   This is area that 
we giving a great deal of effort and attention to but what are our plans if 
we fail to be the largest in this platform.  I don't feel that in the oil 
business we will be successful unless we can be the most preferred site 
because most companies will not have two websites up on the computers.   We 
are having a difficult time getting anybody but the most aggressive trading 
companies to look at our numbers so it seems difficult to believe the 
industry will look at two different e-trading sites.   

BUILDING THE PHYSICAL TRADING BUSINESS 
This has always received luke-warm interest from Enron.  I believe that the 
inefficiency within the oil markets is not great enough to try and profit on 
that
alone.   So when we talk about going big that really means getting involved 
in some kind of steel and trying to dominate certain aspects of the physical
business.  Tankage and shipping are the easiest and quickest ways for us to 
increase the business we are already doing in these areas with the shortest
financial commitment.  Mike and Jeff you should be aware though that the 
corporate commitment to be in the oil business has previously been poor.  We 
can
candycoat this subject but it is very clear that most of our competitors are 
more aggressive on the credit and performance risk in emerging markets.  We 
have
a credit department that have done a poor job, if any at all, in getting out 
there visiting with the national oil companies that we have to be able to 
participate with
(petrobras, pertamina, petrolimex, sinochem, sinopec, egpc, nnpc) if we have 
any real plans of significantly expanding our physical volumes.   We are also 
the
worst company in the oil business in putting out a contract that shows we 
have a commitment to perform.  Our contracts are also drafted with many 
escape clauses that will be rejected by many end-users who will insist on a 
greater performance guarantee.  As we discussed briefly in Singapore, I think 
there are several airlines that we could target in the U.S. for physical 
supply.  I will tell you now that legal would not accept the consequential 
damages that the airlines have in their tenders.   Previously, I have not 
gone after this business because I didn't believe we would have the political 
clout or sponsorship from those in your position to take legal on in such 
matters.  Please consider this (I will fax you a tender offer from Japan 
Airlines) and lets discuss if we are ready to accept that if we fail we are 
willing to accept that it could cost us several million dollars.  That kind 
of loss I have never experienced and seen it happen on very few occasions but 
it is something that we have to accept if we want to go after the airline 
business.  


I will let you know more my thoughts about how we go should try to go 
forward....this message was more to highlight how I'm trying to advance the 
group along and what are the challanges we face at the moment.  Lastly, on 
that theme we are trying to work with IT over here to develop some systems 
that will make us better suited to do customer business.  At the moment 
everybody is working off of individual excell spreadsheets and we are trying 
to get toward a server based system
and options system that would be available to everybody and designed by IT 
people instead of traders.  I will let you know if we need any help from you 
on this as intially we do seem to be getting stonewalled by the London IT 
department.

Subject: Liquids VaR violation

Liquids VaR for effective date Dec. 06 is $8.5MM, a seven percent violation 
of its limit.  The cause of the violation was due to the following factors.
Company wide crude position got shorter 6.3MM barrels
Short NG from Jan-Feb-01 of 1.2 BCF.  (EOL trade placed in error, position 
Nowlan intended for was 10 contracts/month instead of 10 contract/day.)

With component VaR attached below, it is clear that crude product resulted 
the most VaR increase.  Keeping everything constant, if Nowlan gets out of 
his NG position, VaR would be $7.8MM.

Hi John, hope things are well...Hickerson and I were talking yesterday about 
the convert bond desk, and he mentioned to me that it make sense for it to 
come to his group.  I understand you have had prelim discussions about this, 
and wanted to catch up with you on this matter.  I'll give you a ring by 
week's end if we want to proceed.  My initial reaction is that it probably 
makes sense....

We have completed the preliminary Transammonia valuation analysis with an 
equity range of $70MM to $80MM (enterprise value of $250MM to $260MM).  The 
conditional and non-binding letter to the counterparty will be faxed today 
with an equity range of $60MM to $80MM.  I lowered the bottom end of the 
range to $60MM for negotiation purposes.

Attached is a presentation we've put together focusing on Transammonia's 
business, deal specifics, and our financial valuation.

Our inventory (physical position) is aprox 494,000 credits long which at 
roughly $125/credit value for the strip (2000-2010) would have an asset value 
of $62 million.  Give me a call for an explanation of our position report

First--Ted your voicemail isn't working.

I would like to get active in recruiting products traders, in a real attempt 
to high grade the group.  Can we, and how do we make a full court press with 
the headhunters out there?  Also, what do you guys think of putting a big ad 
in the Chronicle, and the WSJ?  We could also look for originators and 
marketers.

Jeff,

Jane Allen and I met with Doug today to discuss the green card procedure for 
he and his wife.  We will start this process immediately, but it's a long 
road - approx 2.5 years.

Doug asked if we would be willing to cover immigration attorney fees for his 
wife should she find an employer willing to file for a work permit, but is 
unable to pay legal fees of  $2-3,000.  It is fairly common that Enron would 
cover legal fees for the spouse in this situation, but I will need your ok.

Shanna

November 11th (Associates)
Columbia, NYU Stern, UCLA, UVA (Darden), Cornell and Vanderbilt

December 9th 
Wellesley, overflow and re-schedules from previous Super Saturdays

If you don't have a preference. I would prefer that you do either November 
4th or 11th.  I think that would be most beneficial.  You are certainly 
welcome to do both but I didn't want to push my luck (smile). Please let me

Jeff,
To ensure that the business units are involved in the recruiting of top 
quality candidates I am requesting your assistance in the Super Saturday that 
is scheduled for either Saturday, November 4th, November 11th or December 
9th.  We would like for you to participate as follows:

Be the speaker at breakfast
Interview candidates 
Facilitate the decision making meeting

The breakfast is from 7:30 AM until 8:30 AM.  The speech would begin at 
approximately 8:00 AM and need not be more than 15 to 20 minutes.  You would 
interview approximately 4-6 candidates.  A vital part of the process is 
determining which candidates will receive offers to join the Program.  We 
would like for you to facilitate the decision making meeting.  The meeting 
will be held in 5C2 beginning at 1:30 PM. and conclude by 3:30 PM.  We will 
provide the administrative assistance.
Your assistance and input would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know 
as soon as possible of your availability.
Thanks in advance.

By the way thanks for the help you have provided with Penn at both the 
graduate and undergraduate level.  It is very much appreciated.

Charlene

Dear Ms. Fraser,

I am writing after having heard from a contact at Enron that you are seeking 
a number of people to fill various vacancies at your Houston office.  If this 
is the case I would very much like to be considered for one of these 
vacancies.

As you will notice from the attached Curriculum Vitae I am currently employed 
as an Energy Markets Consultant at Wood Mackenzie in Edinburgh, the energy 
consultancy arm of Deutsche Bank.  My prior work experience includes two 
years as a Gas Markets Analyst for a Management Consultancy firm in London, 
time as an Energy Journalist covering the European gas and electricity 
markets and a year long spell as an academic Research Assistant.

Prior to these positions I read for an MSc in Energy Studies at the Centre 
for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy at the University of Dundee, 
Scotland.  Whilst reading for the MSc I elected to specialise in oil and gas 
industry economics and law.

Before undertaking the MSc I read for a B.A. (Hons) Business Administration 
degree.  This allowed me to build, develop and hone to a high standard the 
essential skills of financial, strategic, business and economic analysis.  
Having majored in Management Accountancy I am well versed in undertaking 
analysis tasks of this type at both a micro and macro level, from both a 
qualitative and quantitative approach.

Given the opportunity, I feel confident I could make an immediately tangible 
contribution to the work of Enron.  I have attached my CV in Word 97 format.  
If this is incompatible with your systems please do not hesitate to contact 
me and I will send it in a different format.

I apologise in advance for this unsolicited approach.  If you feel that there 
is a likelihood that my skills and background could potentially be of 
interest to Enron I look forward hopefully to hearing from you in due course.

Yours faithfully,

Andrew Hill B.A. (Hons) MSc  M. Inst. Pet.

Jeff, 
Interesting.  Do you like this guy?  What about Crude and products 
origination working for Randy?  On the LNG front we should look at him if you 
like him but i don't think it is a no brainer.  Neal will be coming on in 2 
weeks, do we need him?  Maybe we do.

house isn't furnished yet.  Who has time to go the grocery store?
The hotel is the Hotel Costes on the Foubourg (sp?) St. Honore.  It's muy 
bueno.  Please, let's not telll the world about this gem.

Jeff,

When you get a chance, could you email me the name of that hotel in Paris you 
were telling me about?  My friend Megan and I are going to pop over to Paris 
for a weekend later this month and we might check it out.

Hope everything is well with you.  Is the new house all furnished?  Will we 
be seeing you on this side of the world anytime soon?

Happy New Year!

Regards,
Merritt

you're doing a great job.  don't be rattled, I was going to ask you to assess 
someone, but I'm not ready to ask you yet.  
keep up the good work.  By the way, do you have a current resume so the 
trading track people can keep track of you.  I need one to get you in the 
program.

Jeff-
 When I was in your office you rattled me a quite a bit when you said you 
weren't ready to ask me a certain question.  I know that you and I have not 
had the chance to really talk lately and I've actually been in and out of the 
office in the late afternoons trying to get some health issues resolved.  I 
want to let you know I'm trying very hard to focus and work with Niamh in 
London, learn as much about reisd, and trade into what we think are solid 
positions.  So far I feel like its been going better than I even expected, 
but I know I have a lot more to learn.  I'm enjoying this product and working 
in EGM.  I'm trying to manage this Penn thing on the side and still help out 
Jenn and Fundamentals when they need it.  I'm begining to see what it means 
to be streched thin, something I'm sure you experience quite often.  I do 
want you to feel like you can ask me anything.  I'm here to express my ideas 
to you or if you feel like I'm not working hard enough, I'd like to know.  
I've really appreciated everything you've done.

Sarah

Hi, hope you are doing great.  I was wondering if you've met Russell Dyke, 
who is in Lagrasta's group, and who I told could get into the LNG before you 
came over.  He has great international experience, and LNG experience.  He 
might be a great match with the Jose team, since I'm uncomfortable with their 
understanding of MTM, and their overall appreciation of the Enron way of 
doing business.  (Today, Russel (assoc/mgr at year end) closed a deal with 
CSFB worth 19 million to us.)  Overall a solid guy.   Let me know what you 
think.  (Merritt and Russell know each other well, and have worked on 
projects together)

Also, I mentioned to Merritt that I was excited about her opportunity to 
trade dutch power, but was very interested in staying in touch with her, 
possibly to trade freight, etc.  

Jeff

The V@R violation memo should state that the reason we had a violation was 
the additional trading positions relating to the EOL 24 hr. trading 
activity.  There is currently a memo requesting an additional $2mm of V@R on 
Greg Whalley's desk.  This addtional V@R will be temporary until there are 
Board approved limits for these trading positions.

for Thursday, 2/22 from 8 am to noon.  Representatives from McKinsey will 
also participate/direct this meeting as facilitators to our strategic 
process.  We're finalizing an agenda which will be forwarded to you once it 
is complete.  (de la Roche/Terlip - please be sure this gets sent to all 
attendees asap).


This will be a very important process which we feel your input is critical 
and valuable.  I want to encourage everyone to not only attend but to be 
proactive in the process as well.  This will start as somewhat of a 
"brainstorming" session but our plan is to evolve into a definitive set of 
priorities, opportunities and action items which we hope will create value 
across both the trading and origination groups.  Given the size of the group, 
it has been very challenging finding a convenient time and place to 
accomodate everyone but I hope each of you will do what you can to attend.  
We've purposefully started the meeting late to try and accomodate the 
traders' schedule needs.



BETH:

WE NEED TO GET EITHER A CONF ROOM (preferably) OR RESERVE A MEETING ROOM AT 
THE DOUBLETREE, HYATT OR WEDGE TOWER, ETC... FOR THIS MEETING.
PLEASE CHECK THE DISTRIBUTION LIST ABOVE AND COMPARE AGAINST YOUR LIST OF 
ORIGINAL INVITES TO THIS MEETING.  IF I'VE MISSED SOMEONE, PLEASE BE SURE 
THEY ARE NOTIFIED OF THE CHANGE IN DATE, TIME AND PLACE.  ALSO, BE SURE TO 
LET MCKINSEY KNOW THE LOCATION AS WELL.

They are looking at trading advertising time.  Ed Ondarza may be the guy.  
I'd be happy to introduce you to him, if you'd like.

okay-i have a question-have you heard anything about a new group in Broadband 
that will be trading commercial air time?
I believe it involves Edward Andarza and some other guy named Ben Freeman. I 
thought it might be of interest to someone with 
a communications background, that purchased television air time.....

thanks-Kim

Doug Leach call me  this morning and told me that the offer that he made to 
the LNG group 6 months ago is now off the table. He said that this has also 
been transmitted to Mike McConnell in writing. His reason was that he had 
bent over backwards to make the proposal originally and the LNG group has 
been slow to respond. I reminded him that we were delayed in getting back 
because of some legal issues but now that we were all part of EGM that this 
was no longer an issue. He went on to say that he will not turn over any of 
the fees until phase 2 kicks in, some time next year (Marc de La Roche said 
something to me the other day about Jan.01). That the LNG group will have to 
bear all expenses until that time just like EFI had to for liquid fuels. He 
did say that in their case India did reimburse them on their previous 
expenses as a reduction/credit to the fee. He also went on to say that he was 
not happy with India's attempt to get a piece of EFI's fee.
Please advise how you would like me to proceed.

FYI---this project is heating up rapidly and may be quite attractive.  I had 
separate talks inLondon on Friday last week to explore turning this into a 
regional development project in the Aqaba/Eilat area at the tip of the red 
sea (where Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi all meet and where a regional 
planning authority is in place).  There may be a good opportunity for a 
regional power and district cooling plant with energy management and 
gas/power marketing opportunities.

Will advise after Rob's meeting s in Cairo/Amman and after we scrub this at 
our Dubai planning meeting this week

Charles,

Further to my last email my thoughts on the competing schemes are as
follows;

I reviewed the subject of your email from the angle of competing schemes and
the advise I received is that the whole project should be presented and
dealt with as an "area" project serving several countries inclusive of
Jordan (ie. the hub approach). It is very important that it is promoted this
way or there might be a big risk of leaving the image or consideration that
this is just purely a Jordanian project without a broader scope.

Regards,
Hamdi

Fellows,

I had a number of interesting sessions today on Amman on the subject of
Egypt gas. IN summary:

- The Prime mInister and Oil Minister are open to discuss this project,
in the context of clear future needs, estimated at 400 BCF by 2005. As a
matter of fact, the Oil Minister - Wa'el Sabri - brought in his senior
team to the meeting and scheduled a working session with Enron for
September 27, at 10:00 AM

- In addition, the Royal Court (Diwan) support this development and has
sent to the meetings Dr. Bassem Awadallah, the Economic Advisor to King
Abdullah

- The Amoco deal is dead: they had an axclusivity arrangement which
ended recently and they had in mind a pricing scheme linked to the "fuel
being used currently" or to oil prices, both of which were totally
unacceptable to JOrdan

- Whatever deal there is will need to compete against the odds that the
deal with Irak, which provides Jordan with virtually "free" oil, will
keep as it is. In fact, it is this deal which has allowed the Government
to procrastinate on the AMOCO discussions

- Jordan is comfortable that there is gas in Risha, close to the Irak
border. Schlumberger are currently exploring in that region. The thing
is that the government is convinced that whatever gas they may find in
Risha should not prevent them fromstriking a deal for an import scheme

- The government has been approached by the Saleh Kamel group of saudi
arabia, which believes thay may be able to set up a new company which
will develop gas fields in the northwestern part of saudi (Tabouk) and
export it to Jordan. This is still at a very preliminary stage, but
appears to be of great interest to the jordanians

- IN addition, British Gas approached the minister with a new scheme,
relying on gas discovered "off the coast of Gaza and Israel, which will
require a shorter pipeline. the thing is that the Jordanians feel
uncomfortable with imports through Israel at this stage of the "peace
process"!

So here we are, welcome to pitch into this situation. I used the
argument of speed of development and this is something we need to check
with the Egyptians.

The course of action is as follows:

1. ENRON is to issue a letter to the Jordan Energy Minister (ASAP)
stating the opportunity and formally requesting discussions. No
MIDDLEMAN PLEASE...THIS WAS CLEARLY STATED BY THE PM and the Minister!.
The address is:
H.E. Eng. WA'EL SABRI
Minister of Energy & Mineral Resources
P.O.Box 140027, Amman, Jordan
Fax No. 9626 586 5373
Phone No. 9626 581 1338

A fax will do, as far as the minister is concerned.

2. A meeting has been scheduled on september 27, at 10:00 AM in the
Minister's office. it is likely to be attended by Ahmad Bashir,
secretary General of the Ministry and Rashad Aburas, Advisor to the
Minister (National Electric Power Co.), plus some other people

3. Based on the demand projections and timing, the jordanians expect
some kind of a formal proposal. time of important, as other competing
schemes may have political or technical delays

Fellows, the Jordanians are supportive of the scheme and its sponsors,
so we need to capitalize on this.

In line with my phone discussions with Rob, I will try to rearrange the
meeting for monday sept. 25 and, if possible, our meeting in Cairo for
sunday sept. 24.

I will keep you posted. Any thoughts on the competing schemes are most
welcome.

Charles

Jeff- Hi- 

WE finally started trading with them- have done some Brent/ WTI and heating 
oil.

Jason Hotra- the younger trader is coming into the Houston office tomorrow 
all day with me- I was hoping he could come into the crude meeting-

Would this be OK? We'd have to announce him to all the traders- it would be a 
great forum for him to get a feel for what we are doing.

Sorry for last minute- 

Per probably told you they are very interested in the syndication deal he is 
working.

On other fund fronts: Tudor started trading Brent with us and is putting on a 
large position in nat gas/ heat.

We have documents signed with 3 other funds - ready to roll on Jan1

On funds and metals, I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes.

Thanks and Regards,
Caroline

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking

hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking

Jeff, I understand you've been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders 
for some of your transportation work.  Please do not go directly to the 
traders, rather the structuring desk.  Also, please coordinate your activites 
with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight, dealing with all trucking and 
rail issues.  We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of 
the customers you've pitched.  In most cases, we have been covering many of 
these customers from the energy side already.

Thanks for your cooperation

Jeff,

To continue on an email I sent to you and Mark Tawney a couple of weeks ago.

As indicated then, over the past couple of months I have been building a 
relationship the Sr. VP /Head of Product Development of Wells Fargo Capital 
Markets Group in SF. His mandate is to broaden the bank's capital markets 
capabilities.

In the hopes of achieving this,  he has asked me to explore (with him) 
potential areas where Wells and Enron could benefit from some sort of 
strategic relationship with Enron i.e. bringing commodity, weather, credit, 
etc.  risk management capabilities to their broad corporate client base.

Mark has suggested to me that he would welcome the opportunity to join me 
(EnronCredit.com) in representing the weather desk to Wells Fargo and 
exploring any potential strategic relationship with them.

Do you have any interest in presenting Wells with Enron Global Market's full 
trading/risk management capabilities?
If you do not on any organised basis, would you just I speak to the desk 
heads on an individual basis to explore their interest?

Understanding you are incredibly busy, please let me know of your thoughts 
regarding your interest in this as soon as possible.

Thanks,
George Zivic

Janie,

Per our telephone conversation, I am attaching my resume for your review. As 
we discussed, I am seeking a permanent (Manager level) position where my 
finance and origination skills would be best leveraged.  I am very interested 
in a role in financing and/or orginating energy deals - wholesale or retail.  
If you or one of the groups interested in interviewing me require a 
reference, please contact my current supervisor, Rob Gay, or current and 
former colleagues Peter Anderson and Greg Blair, respectively. 

Thanks again for your help and advice.

Regards,
Tracee

Jeff:

It was a pleasure to meet you last week at the Inn at Penn.  It sounds as
though Enron is doing some very exciting things with more to come in the
future.

I called Vince Kaminski a few times last week.  His secretary mentioned that
he was off again this week on a business trip returning on Oct 9th, I
believe.  I am confident that he will get a project proposal to us by the 13
Oct deadline.

Thank you for your support of the Wharton School.  We look forward to having
Enron host a Tiger Team Project.

Sincerely,

Subject: Intercontinental Exchange enrollment

In order to manage the enrollment of users onto this system, all users must 
enroll via eRequest.  The approval process will mimic that of EnronOnline.  
The requester will go to our internal security application (eRequest) and 
search on ICE.  They must select the products they want to trade - ICE offers 
gas, power, oil and metals.  This will then generate a message to the 
applicable desk head for approval, and generate the appropriate message to 
security to install the application needed to run the ICE.  Once this is 
approved, Stephanie Sever (x33465) will coordinate getting user ids from the 
ICE.  This normally takes a couple of days.  As soon as we get user ids and 
passwords, we will notify the applicable individual.  

To date, the entities that have signed Participant Agreements are ENA, EPMI 
and ECC.  The cost is $500 per month per user on the ICE.

Please call me if you have any questions.

It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  

Thanks.   Jeff

No, I don't have that CD.  Can I crank it up so loud in my house, and piss 
off the neighbors?  I was out til about 11:30 last night.  (another two shift 
evening).  I'm pretty close  to the point where I can't drink after 10 ish on 
a school night.  Then, my neighbors house alarm went off for over 1/2 hour at 
2:30.  Of course i called the police.  So i didn't wag my butt out of bed til 
7:30.  
So first party may be feb 24.  any thoughts?
I'd forward an email that has gone around a few times about your dad's girly 
friend, only then letting her know she's invited.  maybe tell her the wrong 
time.

When are you off to san fran?  I have a wallet i'm trying to have made out 
there at some stuffy, but cool store off union square.

Rick,

I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting
with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them
a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us 
their progress implementing risk management practices.

Can we arrange for them a standard presentation, like the one we have for 
banks
(you or David Port, Bill Bradford, research)?

Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
(given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8,
at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.

I shall also contact Jeff Shankman and John Nowlan
to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them.

Vince

SUMMARY

Atlantic

Over the last week we have really seen the consequences of the wet and warm 
winter in Europe with a total of some 1.7 million
tonnes being offered to us on the resell for delivery over the next couple of 
months. As a consequence spot/Q2 prices are now
trading at $2 discount to replacement from South Africa ($40.75 FOB ARA 
versus $42.75 replacement) - a concept which many are
struggling to get their head round. The Lion's share of the resell mkt is 
South African which makes sense as the strong U.S. mkt has 
taken what little slack there has been in the South American pipeline. In 
truth, while the U.S. mkt has been steaming, only very limited 
incremental tonnage from SAM has made it into the U.S. as the Utilities only 
pay up for spot spot material. If the steep backwardisation
in the U.S. rolls forward there may remain opportunities to bury spot SAM 
cargoes at high levels but one thing is for sure is that the
strong U.S domestic market will keep U.S. exports into Europe very low. 

Pacific

Very few Australian cargoes have found their way to the fair shores of Europe 
over the last few months and this has been a function of 
the strong Pacific market at the back end of 2000 and indeed in part due to 
the consolidation which has been going on, the latest 
development to be Rio Tinto's acquirement of Peabody's asset's in Oz. We are 
currently entering the period of negotiations between Oz 
producers and the JSM's for pricing of their long-term contracts. It is not a 
secret that the producer's plan to go for broke and are looking to 
lock in prices above $30 FOB Newcastle - currently wud call the mkt $28.50. 
JSM's are apparently holding tight citing world economic 
slowdown.  At $28 the oz producer is making some $13 a tonne, the chinese are 
due to export a further 6 million mt this year and steel 
production is forecast to be down some 10% year on year - while we may see 
some activity at higher prices in the short-term I think it 
will be difficult for the producers to realise the numbers which they are 
talking longer term. China is also talking prices of $30 which is
$3/4 higher than last year but have some $3 frt advantage versus Newcastle.

Gameplan

We are currently a total of 2.4 million mt short ARA (1 million API2 / 1.4 
million SECA) with the bulk being in back end of this year. We will
continue to sell the front end aggressively in the belief that the mkt has 
some further downside from where we are today - the mkt has merely 
sold off on rumour thus far but when these cargoes actually start arriving 
unsold into Europe there shud be some additional pressure on prices
if the stock situation does not improve in ARA - currently a 13 day lineup in 
Rotterdam. There are reports of Siberian type weather heading our
way which cud increase burn temporarily but I donot think this will have a 
significant impact. We are busy looking for any opportunity to sell
out of our South African long as Glencore tries to prop the mkt up and will 
then look to buy back our physical shorts into Europe from the
Armada of coal which is due to arrive. Psychology shud create downward 
pressure along the whole forward curve and we will be looking to 
buy in some our deferred short sub $30 RBCT equivalent. Meanwhile we are 
working to sell 3-5 year agreements with several utilities while
the mkt loiters in the higher regions of the historical range. We are also 
talking with several producers about securing longer term contracts 
which will give us a good supply base to work from going forward. In the 
Pacific we will look for an opportunity to cover our CLP short on the 
nearby but will look to the fundamentals to do their work bfor covering 
anything further forward.

Love the new place!  Hopefully you kept warm last night!  (You didn't have to 
sleep in your car, did you?) (Or did you have to drink the champagne to keep 
from freezing?)   Unfortunately I won't know about the Lay's party until 
tomorrow.  Hopefully it will work out.  
My first party--first week in Feb--Ali's planning it.
Aren't I cooler than Kenneth's brother Mark?  Just checking.

Looks like there is plenty of work to do, and I continue to believe shipping, 
etc. has great possibility for Enron.  I'd like to get a group of people to 
talk about plans going forward, and will fill you in shortly on time, where, 
etc.  One point is that it is our policy not to speak to the press without it 
being cleared through public relations first.  Your comments were 
interesting, but I was concerned about perception.  Please coordinate public 
statements, interviews, and the like through the proper channels going 
forward.   

Thanks.  

Jeff

No thoughts on Skilling's speech.  He just needs to emphasize we are a great 
productive entrepreneurial company.  Any we're are largest energy trading and 
risk management house in the world.  It would be ok if he mentioned that I am 
a Wharton '89 undergrad and run a large part of our trading group.  Students 
like to see where successful wharton alum are in the world.  (By the way, I'm 
the lead for wharton grad and wharton/penn undergrad).  This speech he is 
giving is a great opportunity for us to recruit...

On another note, I have an idea for you.  Get on my calendar for early part 
of week after next  (I'm going to the Japan office opening, then to sydney 
and will be in the office nov. 6)  Keep a low profile on the xcelerator for a 
week.

Later,  

Jeff

Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting:  have
you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in
particular).  We have been very successful in helping customers save quite
a bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and
gas markets, that can be extremely valuable...

Did you use the emergency call?  I almost called you on your cell phone in

the singing I got the stuff an Neiman's that I needed.  I had a freak out 
attack though b/c I thought I lost the Saks bag with the $600 bracelet in it 
and was running around Neiman's like an idiot.  Then I remembered that I 
DROVE from Saks to Neiman's and it was in my car.  I think I was just a 
little bit on edge last night!  I met my friend at Barnaby's for dinner and 
then got under the covers and finished my book.  It was great.  By the way, I 
wish I dragged you to the singing b/c Sarah, the 10 month old cutest baby on 
the planet was there.  She was clapping and singing along the whole time 
which was the cutest thing especially b/c she was on my lap the entire time.  
It was worth sitting through a horrible rendition of every Hanukkah song you

meeting or walk around to your employees' desks, we need you to let them know 
that the survey is important to Enron and we would appreciate their

Dear Jeff:
?
Hello!? I wanted to make a bill for you for  the table and ceramic pieces, is 
that ok?
?
?
Can you be in Washington on October 28??  There's a great day-long symposium 
in conjunction with the Art Nouveau show  (which I saw on Friday, and which 
is, incidentally, much bigger and better than  the one in London was) which 
I'm going to, and I would love to be able to tour  around the show with you.? 
Also, Macklowe Gallery is having a cocktail  party that night for our 
clients, friends, experts, and assorted fabulous  hangers-on.? You'll get an 
invite in the mail, but I?wanted to give  you advance notice since I know how 
hectic your schedule is.
?
I hope it was an easy and meaningful fast for you,  and that this year brings 
you happiness beyond your wildest  imagination.
Tell me what's up
love.
ben?

As you suggested last week, I am letting you know that I have yet to hear

about what she is doing and I was exited about what she had to say.  let me

Jeff,
I am following up on the voicemail I left you on Thursday October 5th, 
requesting a recommendation for a Director and Vice President to represent 
Analyst and Associates in the final 2000 PRC.  Due to promotions and 
additions to the Associate and Analyst Programs, we have an additional slot 
for both the Associate PRC and Analyst PRC that we would like to fill with an 
EGM participant.  This will keep the distribution throughout the business 
units equitable.  

We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the 
PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.  Please forward your 
choice for Global Markets representation to me by this date or contact me to

Draft:

We are please to announce the following within Enron Global Markets:

Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to start our new 
finance origination activities.  In this role, he will work with all 
commodity products, assets,  and teams and lever our existing businesses with 
new this new focus.  (Do you want to put in his background--which you 
probably now more than I?)  He will be reporting to the Office of the 
Chairman.

Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick 
Bergsieker.  We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG 
markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity.  (Do you want to put in 
his background?)  Rick will be relocating to Dubai, and bring his martket 
relationships and  industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project 
Dolphin (do we want to say this?) and other related Mideast projects.  Eric 
and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman.  

Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all 
products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet 
pages exist today.  Previously, Jen was working in the Mid Market origination 
group.  Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial 
interface for our intranet page.  Heather was with Azurix, where she worked 
on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives. 

Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable.  This group will be 
comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management 
businesses.  This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics 
important to their individual markets, and discuss other  markets in a macro 
sense.  We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group.  In this 
group, traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability 
will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a 
bias toward structural shifts in markets.  This group will not be involved in 
customer activity, and will execute through our principal desks.   Gary will 
manage this new group, as well as continuing with his current F/X, Rates, 
Equity, and Agriculture initiatives. 

(anything else?)

Before I call Don, I just want to confirm with you that your understanding is 
that we will assist EES in putting their publications on their own site.  In 
other words, Don would need to appoint his own people - an IT person to build 
the site (which we can assist with) and someone to research all their 
publications to see whether they're available electronically.  The EES Marcom 
group sent me 33 publications which they subscribe to and before I call Don 
to tell him he needs an EES person to take care of these, I want to make sure 
you and I have the same understanding.  We briefly talked about this before, 
but I want to be certain.  Thanks.

Subject: LNG Offsite -----Nov 20/21

Mike/Jeff:  

Each year at about this time I hold an LNG Offsite meeting to review the 
progress of the year and to set direction for the next year.  This year's 
offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.  We picked 
these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year 
because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at 
this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.

Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international 
direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.

I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in 
the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite 
into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team 
meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day.

This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on "mark to 
market" mechanics, the LNG "book", enron online and any other similar topics 
that may be appropriate.  To that end, we are working on the following agenda:

Overview of EGM/Enron Corp direction:  Mick Mcconnell/Jeff Shankman

LNG organization and strategic objectives:  Rick Bergsieker/Eric Gonzales

LNG risk book:     Presented by Merritt Thomas/Brad Hitch??

Enron Online demonstration and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brad Hitch

Mark to Market fundamentals and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brent 
Price

2000 review/objectives for 2001:

Eastern Hemisphere:  Clay Harris

Atlantic Basin:  Doug Arnell/Emilio Vicens

Shipping, terminalling and Fuel Management:   Wayne Perry

Legal:  Dan Rogers

Several questions:

Mike/Jeff:  would either or both of you be available to participate,at least 
for an hour or so to get us started?

Eric:  can you be there at least for Monday?

Jeff:  have I picked the right people for risk book and online presentations?

Brent:  can you be there to conduct a seminar on Mark-to-Market (including 
key contractual provisions required)?

FYI, Wayne Perry and his assistant Cindy Long are coordinating arrangements 
for this offsite.

This is the proposed invite list to the LNG offsite that has been scheduled 
for the Woodlands on Monday, Nov. 20. Please send me the names of any 
additions you suggest. I would like to get out a note to people on this ASAP.

We plan an all day meeting on Monday and Golf, etc for those that want to do 
so on Tuesday. That way those that need to travel or work are only tied down 
one day. I would also appreciate any agenda ideas you may want to include.

Jeff,

The LNG group currently has 4 development engineers where their reporting was 
previously into Haug.  I was wondering if within EGM, we had any other 
engineers that we could group these resources with in terms of reporting.  

If not, I would suggest that we make the most senior one group lead (Dave 
Glessner) and have them report directly to you or Mike.  Although these guys 
are currently focused on LNG activities, I know from experience with a couple 
of them they also have generalists capabilities.  In Europe, Brian Stanley 
leads this develop engineering effort where he represents the owner (Enron 
Europe).  He has dual reporting into Sherriff and Larry Reynolds (one of 
Izzo's guys).  

If you could come back to me on this quickly it would be very helpful as this 
is the last thing we need to finalise in our group structure.

Thanks
Eric

 Office of the Chairman
From: Office of the Chairman@ENRON on 19/10/2000 17:24 CDT
To: All Enron Worldwide
cc:  
Subject: Organizational Changes

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.

Jeff,
To ensure that the business units are involved in the recruiting of top 
quality candidates I am requesting your assistance in the Super Saturday that 
is scheduled for either Saturday, November 4th, November 11th or December 
9th.  We would like for you to participate as follows:

Be the speaker at breakfast
Interview candidates 
Facilitate the decision making meeting

The breakfast is from 7:30 AM until 8:30 AM.  The speech would begin at 
approximately 8:00 AM and need not be more than 15 to 20 minutes.  You would 
interview approximately 4-6 candidates.  A vital part of the process is 
determining which candidates will receive offers to join the Program.  We 
would like for you to facilitate the decision making meeting.  The meeting 
will be held in 5C2 beginning at 1:30 PM. and conclude by 3:30 PM.  We will 
provide the administrative assistance.
Your assistance and input would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know 
as soon as possible of your availability.
Thanks in advance.

By the way thanks for the help you have provided with Penn at both the 
graduate and undergraduate level.  It is very much appreciated.

Charlene

I've already talked to Cliff B.  The only thing we are precluded from is 
building a power plant in Singapore...

Jeff, You're right. I missed it.  Go ahead and send yours back with the 
Singapore operations and current trading operations exclusion and mention

I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete 
for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased 
expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This 
was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece 
of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners 
going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we 
do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.  
Maybe I don't understand it all.

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

fyi - it doesn't sound like the weather piece of the Oslo long-term deals is 
going to have much value.  We are still trying to get that value from Oslo 
and ensure that the weather risk is captured appropriately in EGM risk 
books.  I will keep you updated.

This deal was done as a Power game and when we split it, the main value will 
be on the power book, so don't calc on anything substantial on this

Quarter earnings.  If we can get an idea by then of the value associated with 
the weather piece of the Kotka deal it would be helpful.  Call me if you have

Bjarne and Thor,

Thanks for the confirmation and other information that you provided on this 
deal.  I still need the associated P&L and Weather Risk transferred from the 
Nordic Power books to the Weather book.

It is imperative that this be done immediately from a Risk controls 
standpoint not to mention the fact that Quarter-end is fast approaching.  
Please call or e-mail so as to update me of your progress.


Thanks,
Todd

Subject: lng shipping

jeff
long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

The Weather Risk Management Group will transfer Catherine Woolgar from the 
Oslo office to the Houston office as soon as she is able to transition out of 
her responsibilities in Olso.  In Houston, Catherine will assist in trading 
the US portfolio and be responsible for a number of EOL cities.  Catherine 
has developed a very good understanding of trading weather risk management 
products and the peculiarities of the weather market.

Ross McIntyre in the London Office will continue to provide general support 
to the Oslo office while developing relationships with the commodity desks in 
London and with the market generally.  Additionally, Ross will continue to 
assist in the development of the trade and portfolio analytical systems to be 
utilized globally by the weather desks.

In oder to significantly grow the weather risk management business, we are 
committed to the vision of trading and orginating locally while managing 
globally.  Tthe Weather Risk Management Group ultimately expects to have 
weather trading in most Enron's offices that trade other commodities.  
Accordingly, as soon as commercially feasible, Catherine will return to 
London to work with Ross McIntyre to establish a trading presence in the 
London office.

		 Subject: Asian Credit Alert- AP & P

The Asian Pulp & Paper debt situation is once again becoming critical to 
Asian growth prospects.  AP & P is the most popular Asian bond holding among 
foreign investors.  AP & P narrowly met a Feb.1 deadline for a debt payment 
and has a 30 day grace period on another which runs out at the end of 
February.  Depressed pulp and paper prices and a high risk premium for 
Indonesian debt raise serious doubts about AP & P's ability to meet this 
payment.

The ripple effect of an AP &P default or government-imposed restructuring 
would be significant for Asian credit and equity markets, with possible 
contagion effects for other emerging markets.  We will continue to update 
this issue in the days ahead.

Word from Israel is that the alert has been downgraded for the time being.  
Sources report that US aircraft flying over western Iraq saw that the troop 
movements and missile preparations have been halted, at least for the time 
being.

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with 
each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition.  It is 
important that both business units work together to determine which 
individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will 
begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious 
that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the 
synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power 
businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

If you'd like to get me the resumes today, I'll take a look, and pick a few 
out.  This way we won't need to change the meeting time.  Michelle was my 
first choice to lead the effort.  OK about Suzanne.  

I'm serious about keeping a highly visible presence on campus, and am willing

Would you like to change the meeting to Tuesday October 10th?  The meeting 
would have to take place at 9am because I have a flight out of town at noon.  
Just let me know what you would like to do.

On another note, I wanted to let you know I am removing Suzanne Farrow from 
the team this season.  This decision has come after her incessant quibbling 
with me about pettily details.  I have better things to do with my day than 
to banter back in forth with Suzanne, as I am sure you do as well.  Suzanne 
has been a problem with her continual emails from day one.  I feel we as a 
Wharton team have the recruiting season under control.  Also, Michelle 
Nezi-Marvin has agreed to be the Wharton team lead and has been very helpful 
with details and arrangements over the last couple of weeks.   Thank you.

Dear Mr. Shankman,
?
We met during?your recent  presentation at Wharton.? I had several questions 
about internship and  career opportunities in the oil and gas branch at Enron 
for an MBA  graduate.? You asked me to send you my r,sum, (attached), and 
offered to  put me in contact with people from that branch for further 
information.?  
?
As you will certainly notice, my past  experience is clearly focused on the 
upstream activities.? Although I  am?highly motivated by this sector, I also 
have a strong interest in  other?dimensions of the energy industry, 
especially in the huge, dynamic  growth potential of the utilities branch.

?
I would welcome any comments or questions  you may have concerning my 
motivations and what I could offer Enron in  return.? Therefore, please do 
not hesitate to contact me at home by phone  or by e-mail.
?
I look forward to hearing from you in the  future.
?
Thank you in advance, 
?

In order:

If the A/A program will pay, otherwise, get with my asst Jennifer, and she'll 
help you out with cost allocations.
I have your pitcher, and will bring it to the office.
I'll be happy to have you sit with some of the traders.  Any commodities in 
particular?
I'll try to go to dinner--I may end up with a conflict.

Thanks again for hosting the BBQ on Saturday night.  Your house was Couple of 
things . . .

Where should we charge all of the expenses for the weekend?  Should we charge 
them to recruiting or to your cost center?  If we should charge your cost 
center, what is it?
I think that I left my glass pitcher at your house Saturday night - can I 
come pick it up one night this week?
A while back I mentioned to you that I wanted to spend a day with a gas or 
power trader to understand more about our trading business.  Could you help 
me set that up?  Also, are there any materials that I can look at in advance 
to help me get up to speed or understand what's going on?
Are you planning on going to the dinner Thursday night for the Tiger Teams?

Just to reiterate:  Yes the Saudis are against $40 oil or above.  However, if 
the Israel thing gets bad and a lot of people die or it turns into a 
religious war over al-Aqsa mosque, the rulers will come under serious 
pressure to not help the West by producing more oil.

Arab leaders are holding a summit Oct 21 in Cairo.

No doubt about drinks with you being more fun!  (My haircut is perfect, 
you'll be pleased to know)  I did go out with my neighbors last night--I 
needed to because the guy who is buying my house on woodhead st.  came over 
last night and backed out of his contract.  Boy was I annoyed.  And still am, 
but the good news is he loses his earnest money to me.  So I'm going to take 
out a bunch of friends to dinner when i get back.  Want to go?  I'm thinking 
Tony's or something else fun/festive.  To be determined...but fun.

previous 24 hour period.  Let us know if this is sufficient or if you would

Mr. Shankman:

     I am Dan Reck's new administrative assistant.  I initially interviewed
with Jennifer and Shanna Funkhouser and knew that they were both special.
However, since I have been here (an entire 5 days now!), Jennifer has been
invaluable to me.  On my first day at my desk, she called and asked me to
come to her office and she introduced me to Cathy Phillips and Yolanda
Martinez.  The reason for this e-mail is that I have encountered some
employee problems at my location and have confided in Jennifer.  Her
professionalism, eloquence and intelligence belies her youth.  As I am sure
you are aware, Jennifer is a diamond and she will only shine brighter as
her experience grows.  Life is short and I was raised to say nice things
when warranted.  I am so impressed with Jennifer  and I am proud and feel
privileged to be a member of her team.  Thank you for your time.

Subject: Cement- a new business opportunity?

Jeff:

CALME's HR advised me that there is no match for my skills and experience in 
your business unit.  I spent a great part of my professional career in the 
oil & gas business.  Therefore, I have contacted Mike Brown to see if I can 
bring value to his team.  I have not gotten any response yet.

As I have about three weeks left to find a position within Enron, I would 
like to explore/seek origination opportunities in a totally new area for 
Enron:  Cement.  This industry can be transformed to the new economy and 
given its size, it may well be a significant income generating market for us 
and certainly within a short time another commodity for EnronOnline.

This is new for me but enormously challenging.  I am asking you to give me a 
chance to sell this concept to you at your convenience.  I have enclosed a 
brief resume for your review.

I look forward to meeting with you.  Thanks, Jeff

Thanks for all your help with Sempra.  Hard work, but certainly worth it.  On 
another note, Mike and I have discussed this $2 million issue with American 
Coal, and the interest rate hedge in the MPR.  Bottom line, we are not taking 
this hit.  It seems it was a problem with Treasury, so send it to them.  

Thanks.

Jeff-

As you know, Enron has been working diligently to further its relationship 
with Wharton.  We have recently been asked and have committed to provide a 
speaker for the Wharton Fellows in e-Business conference on the morning of 
January 11th in the San Francisco area.  

We are, of course, in need of a high level speaker from Enron who can speak 
with expertise to the topic of Enron's evolution as a company (from gas 
pipelines to financial products and beyond).  

Are you available?  A Wharton grad with your background would be a stand-out 
contribution to the program.  

I have more detailed information regarding the program and the attendees for 
your review.  Please let me know if you can fit this into your schedule.

Thanks.

Mike

Visited with a ship owner this week who has 2 vessel's they are looking at 
taking ownership and would like us to work with them on a 5 year time 
charter. Both vessels are clean products vessels and we can go over the 
opportunity in more detail. My questions, are this something 1) we are 
looking to pursue? 2) is it being coordinated at some level? The opportunity 
we are looking at would have some MTM value and some forward risk but the 
vessels do handle all the products we trade so we can keep the active and we 
also could use the space to market online. I like the structure and believe 
it is worth a good look.

Subject: California Power 1/15/01

As talks continued toward the Tuesday deadline markets have been focused on 
for the California electricity crisis, state officials around Governor Gray 
Davis have
  toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed 
they would be in the market as early as Tuesday taking bids for energy to be 
paid by the
  State of California. One problem on that front is still how much producers 
want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and 
his aides
  want to pay around $50 to $55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want 
about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best 
way to
  determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market 
approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term 
contracts.

Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the 
view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term 
power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the 
utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.  This week's legislative 
activities
in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing 
purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to 
finance power 
purchases after utility bankruptcy.

1. Audit- Untangling Utility Relationships

California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment 
front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that 
half of the $9 to $12 billion  the utilities say they owe is actually owed to 
themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations

This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both 
the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a 
holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&E 
and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices 
was bought from themselves. 

  But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that 
Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part 
of any 
potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to 
use state credit to eliminate the "risky debt" premium that PG&E 
and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and 
that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase
 utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In 
return he is demanding that the companies prepare to "share the 
burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension."

2. Debt Restructuring- Guarantees, but No Direct State Money

 Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $12 billion in back 
debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up
during a 90-day forbearance period (whether that period has been agreed to by 
all creditors is not something we are clear about right now). Davis' idea, as
he laid it out in the meeting, is to use the forbearance period to securitize 
the debts and sell them against the utilities' forward rate base or by 
establishing a
medium-term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees. 

 In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without 
direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to
paydown their debt. One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the 
$50-$55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can 
pay
down this debt. There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state 
guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations, but he remains
opposed to using direct state money. This frustrates both Clinton 
administration and utility creditors, but Davis has not yet shown much 
flexibility.

3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation

  Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury 
and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political
  advisers have with "non-market" solutions to the energy crisis. Although 
the Governor's aides actually believe the weapon is more a "way to force 
eventual
  agreement, than an actual solution," the talk returns frequently to these 
non-market mechanisms. "We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by 
the
  Tuesday deadline. If we make no progress. If this thing looks like it will 
turn into a genuine crisis, then we will use our powers of condemnation and 
we will re-take
  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves," a close political aide to 
Davis said. "We will absorb the plants, the transmission lines and the 
reserved parking
  places of the executives. The legislature would agree in a second."

Dear Celeste and Kristin:

I am re-sending information regarding the Wharton Entrepreneurship
Conference and the opportunities to sponsor the conference as well as
participate in the Expo.  We are expecting the conference to double in
size with more than 1000 attendees.  In addition, we would like to
emphasize that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well outside
of the "dot.com" world including in large, innovative companies such as
Enron.  We have already lined up some smash hit speakers including
Christy Jones of Trilogy and PCOrder as well as Anita Roddick of The
Body Shop.  We would be very interested to have the participation of
Enron in the conferences as a sponsor or at the very least, a
participant in our career expo.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Cassandra Santos

Subject: Wells Fargo visit to Houston

Jeff K.,

Just a follow up to our prior conversations.

Representatives from Wells Fargo will be visiting Enron on Tuesday, January 
9, 2001.

As initially discussed, Wells is looking to learn more about Enron's overall 
risk management/trading capabilities and to explore potential areas of 
co-operation -- "areas where the two organisations may benefit from working 
together". Wells is incredibly interested in the breadth of markets that 
Enron is currently involved in. My sense is that, with a mandate to grow 
their capital market reach, Wells will be looking to us as a potential 
strategic partner in taking many of our capabilities to their immense 
corporate client base.

Based on my relationship with them, they have expressed special interest in 
EnronCredit. The form of this seems quite interesting. My sense is that they 
have explored building their own credit derivative capabilities and for 
various reasons feel that it may be more efficient/economical to build some 
sort of shared capabilities with our group -- I think that our focus on 
solutions for the corporate risk manager is attractive to them. In addition 
to this, their Chief Credit Officer will be joining on this date to explore 
our capabilities in assisting with management of the Bank's credit portfolio. 
Based on my discussions with them and my sense of their interest in exploring 
various types of working relationships with us, I would suggest that we have 
a senior presence at this meeting.

This being said, they also have a great deal of interest in speaking to the 
Heads of all our other risk management/commodity desks. My hope is that Jeff 
Shankman will be available to discuss/introduce Enron Global Markets which 
would then be followed with product presentations from all desks interested 
(Mark Tawney has already agreed to presenting our Weather Derivative 
capabilities). Also, our Global Finance Group has expressed their interest in 
participating during these discussions.

 It has been indicated to me that the following people will be attending from 
Wells Fargo:
Treasurer
Chief Credit Officer
Sr. VP, & Head of Product Development, Capital Markets
Head of Derivative Sales

My hope is to finalise an agenda by the end of the week. In order to 
accomplish this, I would like to discuss (as a group) the best format in 
which to present -- one which will ensure an accurate representation of our 
capabilities and of our interest in developing this relationship.

Thanks,
George

I am pleased that Jason Fischer is doing a fine job as he took my place in 
the role of checking out NYMEX trades and formulating new
relationships with brokers.

One of the key aspects of this job was moving trades to brokerage houses with 
credit financing available at no cost.  Basically,
the brokerage houses want to capture the brokerage fees, in volume, and 
believe that they are able to not worry about charging
for the credit lines.

I'd like to meet you with about this.  An contact of mine in accounting and I 
developed a spreadsheet (see attached: Xpit analysis) to measure
how much we are able to save by these movements.  Also, according to the 
accomplishments list, you'll notice that because of our actions on Fri Oct
13 directed by John Wilson in Products, only for CL, HO, and HU, we were able 
to see an instantaneous change from paying out millions each day to 
the numerous brokers to having millions of dollars wired to us by the brokers.

One of the critical functions of my former job was to manage the positions of 
all futures and options
for all commodities.  From my experience in working closely with the traders, 
we discovered, especially on
Friday, October 13, that moving positions to brokerage houses with credit 
financing dramatically 
reduced our margin expenses thus increasing our daily cashflow in our wired 
brokerage 
accounts. 

Most of September and the week of Oct 9 had negative cashflows.

In addition, I worked with our global finance group, (Sarah Wesner) , to 
increase existing lines and open
other lines of credit at other brokerage houses.

This action, provided we monitor this vigilantly and remind the traders on a 
frequent basis to stay
focused on clearing trades with houses that have financing, will save Enron 
millions of dollars everyday.

Our treasury group, (Mary Perkins), is pleased with this type of financing 
approach as we
are using the additional money to reduce Enron's short term debt.
 
I have informed my former group (esp. Jason Fischer) of the tremendous value 
which my prior
function may add to Enron's financial well-being. 

It is this type of proactive thinking and creative financing that I hope to 
generate in my next rotations. Currently, I am in 
EnronCredit.com.

Furthermore, now that I am in the analyst program, I'd like to discuss with 
you in the late summer/early fall for rotation opportunities.

Thanks
David

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 04/2001




Highlight

Cape market continues to fall but probably too fast and too early by most 
players  Asia will be back from holiday Monday and market is expecting rates 
to stabilise by end of next week.  We are currently evaluating taking another 
cape on short period or fixing a COA with a distressed owner for our Q2 
cargoes out of RBCT or Colombia or both.  The average earnings for a cape has 
fallen from a high of $25,000 in November to $18,500 today.  Pierre is in 
Japan next week and should get a good feel as to what the Japanese steel 
mills are up to and what kind of opportunities are out there for us to 
concentrate on.   

Panamaxes as anticipated are very difficult to read with close to zero Far 
East biz. Atlantic very short term has slight imbalance of tonnage but backed 
by very good USDA corn sales yesterday, the grain will start to role by end 
Feb. Paper rates have remained stagnant again lacking real physical input, 
nearbys marginally easier forwards flat neglected. Strategy will either be to 
bear spread where nearby premiums are good or bide our time and buy Q2 dips 
or calls.

The story out of Bocimar this week is that they view this year as being 
definitely weaker than last year and that they feel it should average around 
$15,000 to $17,000 for the year ( which is still a good market for shipping ) 
and at those levels, they are happy to sit back and watch.   Furthermore, 
last week CMB ( parent company of Bocimar ) released their earnings for cal 
00.  Their Dry bulk division made 60 million Euro and their tanker division 
made 60 million as well.  These are very good numbers for their dry bulk 
division taking into account the incredible rise in bunkers last year ( cost 
of fuelling the ships ) and the fact that their ships were often at anchor 
and not generating revenues.

On the funny side of things, Coeclerici is having their yearly audit by 
Arthur Anderson and AA has discovered that although Coeclerici makes money 
trading FFA's, they lack proper daily position reports and models to value 
options.  As a result, I got a call from Koert ( head shipping at Coaclerici 
) asking for our assistance as AA had mentioned to them that they should talk 
to us about our systems and procedures.  Being that Coeclerici is our biggest 
counterpart, we jumped on the opportunity to assist and Andy James is being 
sent to genoa Tuesday for a one day tutorial about risk controls and 
procedures while trying at the same time to better understand how Coeclerici 
values deals, which needless to say should help us in the future when 
negotiating with them.

probably have a spot for him in the Enron organization so that he doesn't

Jeff,

I don't know if I'm going to get to meet Andrew, but he looks good on paper.  
My only question is whether we need another person working on LNG in Dubai.  
Obviously, I don't know quite what structure you want to put in place, and 
perhaps there are some projects I'm not aware of, but from what I've seen I 
would be worried that this guy would get bored. 

Just a thought, but looking at this guy's resume he'd be an ideal guy to work 
with Jonathan Whitehead and Joe Hirl in Tokyo.  He speaks fluent Japanese, 
knows the Japanese market, has contacts at Mitsubishi, and knows the LNG 
world.  Quite frankly, he might do more good for Enron's LNG effort working 
for Enron Japan than for LNG.

Also, regarding Elba Island, do you think you'd be ready for a conference 
call on Monday?

Thanks,
Brad

Thank you for your note.  It is always appreciated.  I'm sure you will find 
your career here very exciting, and Dan is a leader in our company and I know 
he is excited to have you as part of his team.  

If you are running into some employee issues, I'd ask you to get Shanna

everyone's success.

Mr. Shankman:

     I am Dan Reck's new administrative assistant.  I initially interviewed
with Jennifer and Shanna Funkhouser and knew that they were both special.
However, since I have been here (an entire 5 days now!), Jennifer has been
invaluable to me.  On my first day at my desk, she called and asked me to
come to her office and she introduced me to Cathy Phillips and Yolanda
Martinez.  The reason for this e-mail is that I have encountered some
employee problems at my location and have confided in Jennifer.  Her
professionalism, eloquence and intelligence belies her youth.  As I am sure
you are aware, Jennifer is a diamond and she will only shine brighter as
her experience grows.  Life is short and I was raised to say nice things
when warranted.  I am so impressed with Jennifer  and I am proud and feel
privileged to be a member of her team.  Thank you for your time.

I reached Greg today and had a nice conversation. He encouraged me to call 
you.  

Having missed you today I wanted to make a few suggestions. 
With regard to your reservations about an investment in plant and equipment- 
I understand that any such investment would be: limited and subject to your 
being very attracted to the deal. I am confident that I can bring you deals 
that will sell themselves. 
-need to have an exit strategy that would allow an exit within 2-4years 


A trading strategy without investment in plant and equipment will yield 
attractive results. 

With regard to how that would look - I will draft a short business plan and 
send it to you next week basing it on a pure trading basis.  

Let me invite you and Greg to a breakfast (or any other meal) during the week 
of 16 Jan. That will give me a chance to get a few numbers in your hand 
prior. 

Regards for the New Year

Mike and Jeff:

I am rethinking the legal reports.  Alan and I am preparing a monthly trading 
and transactional summary, a litigation report and the TOP TEN legal risk 
report.  To me the last two are the most important.  On a conceptual basis, 
is that what you need or want to see?

Jeff,Eric   Platt's just reporting what Euell said so they really have no 
reason to aplogize, other than to us for running a story with our name with 
no confirmation as to the validity of what was said. I do not think it a good 
idea for us to be saying too much about this publically and being too 
defensive as it may be interpreted wrongly. I agree with Eric' s decision 
which will be confirmed by  Mark Palmer that we keep our reply to the WSJ 
where we can have some comfort that the facts will be properly reported.

Word today is that the Saudis are committed to defending $25 OPEC basket/$28 
WTI.  They are likely to endorse a further reduction in the OPEC quota of up 
to 1 million b/d at the March meeting, if the data at that time supports such 
a move.

Finally completed tonight

Net to Enron LNG Marketing Company - $ 272,000 ( $0.10/ mmbtu )
Net to Eco  about $3,300,000   ( Enron 50% share about $ 1,650,000 )

Enron total gain not counting  ENA's trading desk margin is $1,922,000 

Not bad for a single cargo.

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

Very different hotels.  It is one of Paris' palace hotels right in the middle 
of of the city.  (near vendome and concorde area)  very central to all of 
paris.  costes is two minutes away, so both are great locations.  Big lobby, 
lots of gold, etc.  Great, but not as cool/hip as costes.  

How's London and the marketing of the 24/7 product?

Hey, I'm over in London. All is well over here.  I was curious if you were 
familiar with the Crillon hotel in Paris?  If so, is it better than the Hotel 
Costes???  I'm heading to Paris this weekend, let me know.

Thanks,

Subject: Potential Nsea deals thru Chris Harris team

FYI, these are the type deals we as a trading group really like as they give 
us some physical volumes so we can get into that market as well as a 
financial transaction to make some money. Both sides should be a winner for 
us.  We have worked with Chris on 2 others of these and they have failed due 
to the variuos reasons but primarily the way the uk tax authorities look at 
the structures. I will keep you posted on the progress.

Subject: Potential Nsea deals thru Chris Harris team

F.Y.I.
We are helping Chris Harris here in London putting a structure together that 
can give us crude oil in the Nsea. 

The idea is that we will buy the crude oil from a North Sea producer to a 
fixed price. The duration could be for the next 4-6 years depending on how 
comfy we are with the exposure. By buying future oil to a fixed price at 
lower numbers than the future curve would suggest and paying upfront (due to 
time value of money), the producer will end up paying less tax.
This has been tried many times before by different banks and never worked. 
This time Chris Harris thinks that by presenting the correct package it might 
pass.  We will see.

However, in case of  success, we will have to do two things.
1. sell futures for the next 4-6 yrs, volume could be 25-50' bpd.
2. sell the physical bbls.

Number 2 is no problem and depending on the volume I think number 1 should be 
OK. We might have to hedge thru WTI, but will try Brent.

Question: with a deal like this do we need any signatures from above? Chris 
Harris will be happy to run a full presentation if required.

regards
chris glaas

At our LNG coordination meeting in London last Friday, I asked Doug Arnell to 
be the point person tocoordinate the assembly of a quick data base of all of 
our LNG sources and uses and ship availability over the next several years.  
He will work with Merritt Thomas, Brad Hitch and Eric Groves and will 
coordinate all of his work with Eric Gonzales.

The purpose of this exercise is to give us, in light of the fact that we do 
not have an operational LNG book,  a quick picture of the overall situation 
so that we can make some quick calls on Hoegh Galleon, Abu Dhabi etc.

I have noted that Doug has since started copying the two of you on lots of 
emails.  I will ask him to take the two of you out of the details on this for 
now so that we don't overload your email inboxes, unless you want to see all 
of the details.

I will screen the emails and forward you info to keep you in the loop but at 
a higher altitude without all of the gory details.

Please advise

I asked Tess about Japan while we were up at Wharton and she wanted to try to 
remain under the radar screen as far as her Japanese expertise because she 
was trying to get some personal issues resolved.  She also wanted to stick it 
out in the Steel Group until some of the uncertaintly was resolved.

I agree that we should put Chris on the resume list.  I am very hesitant to 
guarantee or even indicate where people would go once they get to Enron 
during the interview process.  I know that last year we were looking for 
people who were interested in Asian opportunities (especially Korea and 
China), yet by the time these folks started we no longer had opportunities 
available there, leading to a lot of disappointment and disenchantment with 
Enron.  Jeff, how likely is it that we will still have a strong need for 
people in Japan next August?

I think he has a strong resume.  He's definitely worth putting on the 
interview list.

As for Japan opportunities, is there a way to get Tess Dyar plugged into 
those?  She just started (from Wharton) after spending nearly 10 years at 
Goldman in Japan.  She definitely has an interest in continuing her work with 
the country.  I think she's been a little disappointed since getting here and 
seeing APACHI dissolved.

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Hi Jeff,

Thank you so much for coming last Friday and speaking to the students about 
resumes - and everything else!  I think your story was an extremely valuable 
one.  It is good for the students to hear that there is a life outside Wall 
Street, and that their desire for challenge and stimulation can be more than 
fulfilled outside of New York.  It is also good for them to hear that there 
is not one answer to any particular question, and I appreciated that you and 
all of your colleagues pushed back when they pressed you for THE ANSWER.  All 
of us at MBA Career Management can say that until we're blue in the face, but 
when you speak they listen.

Thank you once again for participating.  And please pass on my best regards 
to Evan Betzer.

Best regards,

Sara Simons

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time 
dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather 
business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become 
full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I 
will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by 
this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important 
that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be 
in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the 
weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations 
and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide 
powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure.

The Weather Risk Management Group will transfer Catherine Woolgar from the 
Oslo office to the Houston office as soon as she is able to transition out of 
her responsibilities in Olso.  In Houston, Catherine will assist in trading 
the US portfolio and be responsible for a number of EOL cities.  Catherine 
has developed a very good understanding of trading weather risk management 
products and the peculiarities of the weather market.

Ross McIntyre in the London Office will continue to provide general support 
to the Oslo office while developing relationships with the commodity desks in 
London and with the market generally.  Additionally, Ross will continue to 
assist in the development of the trade and portfolio analytical systems to be 
utilized globally by the weather desks.

In oder to significantly grow the weather risk management business, we are 
committed to the vision of trading and orginating locally while managing 
globally.  Accordingly, the Weather Risk Management Group ultimately expects 
to have weather trading in most Enron's offices that trade other commodities.

Jeff- Hi- 

WE finally started trading with them- have done some Brent/ WTI and heating 
oil.

Jason Hotra- the younger trader is coming into the Houston office tomorrow 
all day with me- I was hoping he could come into the crude meeting-

Would this be OK? We'd have to announce him to all the traders- it would be a 
great forum for him to get a feel for what we are doing.

Sorry for last minute- 

Per probably told you they are very interested in the syndication deal he is

I will schedule you for Nov. 11th.  If you are around on Dec. 9th we will use 
you but I will also make sure we have someone else.  We don't generally do a 
spring Super Saturday.  We ask the teams to bring back their best two or 
three candidates and then we get together informally to decide.  I will let 
you know when that begins to take place.  I would like to get a small group 
of commercial people for that process as we did with the summer offer 
process.    It generally takes place in February and March.
I will keep you informed.
Thanks Charlene

Jeff thanks alot.  I really appreciate it.  Here are the schedule of schools:

November4th (Analysts)
Rice, UT, Baylor, Texas A&M, OU, Florida, LSU and Univ. of Houston

November 11th (Associates)
Columbia, NYU Stern, UCLA, UVA (Darden), Cornell and Vanderbilt

December 9th 
Wellesley, overflow and re-schedules from previous Super Saturdays

If you don't have a preference. I would prefer that you do either November 
4th or 11th.  I think that would be most beneficial.  You are certainly 
welcome to do both but I didn't want to push my luck (smile). Please let me 
know as soon as possible so that I can get someone else for the ones you 
can't attend.

Again, thanks alot.

Jeff,
To ensure that the business units are involved in the recruiting of top 
quality candidates I am requesting your assistance in the Super Saturday that 
is scheduled for either Saturday, November 4th, November 11th or December 
9th.  We would like for you to participate as follows:

Be the speaker at breakfast
Interview candidates 
Facilitate the decision making meeting

The breakfast is from 7:30 AM until 8:30 AM.  The speech would begin at 
approximately 8:00 AM and need not be more than 15 to 20 minutes.  You would 
interview approximately 4-6 candidates.  A vital part of the process is 
determining which candidates will receive offers to join the Program.  We 
would like for you to facilitate the decision making meeting.  The meeting 
will be held in 5C2 beginning at 1:30 PM. and conclude by 3:30 PM.  We will 
provide the administrative assistance.
Your assistance and input would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know 
as soon as possible of your availability.
Thanks in advance.

By the way thanks for the help you have provided with Penn at both the 
graduate and undergraduate level.  It is very much appreciated.

Charlene

Rick,

As you recall we had previously decided to have E Power be the counterparty 
to BHP for formal arrangements in pursuing the terminal opportunity is Japan. 
Should we reconsider this approach given the new organization. E Power 
interest is in cheap fuel and not the terminal or pipelines. Please advise 
and I will handle with Carey. We have a meeting in Japan with BHP on Oct 16th 
to execute the CA.

As I was packing some books this weekend, I stumbled across an old copy of 
The Story of O, and almost fell over.  I knew I had heard of that book--I 
must have read it some time ago--I think it was orig published in 1954 or 
1965.  Now I remember how much I didn't like it!  Hope you've recovered from 
all your parties.  How was the book dinner.  Did I mention I had a spur of

It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  

Thanks.   Jeff

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 39/2000




Highlight
Had a meeting with Bocimar in our offices this week as they were interested 
in knowing our plans with ABC.  From meeting it became very clear that they 
were out of the running for ABC as they were unwilling to purchase that 
company without a significant discount to current market levels.  Few days 
later, met with CEO of ABC as he had just received a bid from a rival 
shipping company ( Zodiac ) and he was basically begging us to join the 
bidding as he really did not want his company  to fall in the hands of 
Zodiac.  Pierre and I continued to express our interest in ABC but told him 
that we needed more time to evaluate their assets and could not counter on 
such short notice.  Told ABC that we would continue to follow with interest 
and that if buy out by Zodiac failed, we would come back to discuss.  Our 
goal all along was to make sure that Bocimar were not going to get their 
hands on ABC or they would have effectively controlled 50 % of the spot cape 
fleet and made our short position into next year look worrisome.  Having 
shown interest we not only were kept well advised as to what Bocimar was up 
to but it could have reacted quickly to protect our position.  We are 
relatively pleased with the potential of Zodiac buying ABC. 

Also, this week we fixed another Coeclerici cape for period.  We fixed the 
cape Asia build in 1990 for minimum 4-6 months to allow us to use the vessel 
to load out of Australia for CLP in December and hedge ourselves against a 
late winter surge in cape rates but we have the added advantage of having an 
option for a further two years to be declared mid January 2001.  We bought 
ourselves a very cheap call option with an exercise date in three months time 
in a very volatile market.  Further, Coeclerici gave us a put in year two to 
cap our downside and gave us a call option to extend the deal into an 
additional third year .  We are currently discussing with Bocimar the idea of 
putting that cape into their pool if they secure us a floor for year one and 
a share in any upside.  Will keep you posted  !!!


Fixed a 6 panamax contract as vessel owner with National power from South 
Africa to Bristol with option Immingham to give us a very useful short 
position into next year in the panamax sector.  This deal will add to our 
already significant business in South Africa for next year and will allow us 
to arbitrage between cape and panamax vessels as we hold contracts in both 
sectors.  

Furthermore, Intercore has asked us to offer them 6 capes from Bolivar into 
ARA from next March till September which if we were to win the contract would 
make us a definite market maker in the two busiest coal routes ( RBCT/ARA and 
COLOMBIA/ARA ).  


Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Down	Down	Down
Cape Size	Flat	Flat	Flat


Panamax : Market continues to fall for balance of the year as China/Asia was 
on holiday this week and fixings were relatively few 
Capes : Market is steady but few expect a fall in rates for balance of 2000.  
Owners and charterers waiting for coal trans to fix for next year.

Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed  2+1 geared panamaxes from Indo to Hong Kong for November to January 
2001 at $6.35.
Agreed window of 12-21 November with MOSK for Drummond-Redcar lifting
Fixed a panamax for late October loading from Drummond to LBT at $9.80 with 
Bell ships
Sold a cape to the coal desk from Bolivar to Rotterdam at $6.85 for q3 next 
year

Third parties freight deals
As mentioned above structuring a deal with Coeclerici and Bocimar
Fixed 6 panamaxes from RBCT to UK ports for National Power for all of 2001 at 
around $10
Trying to sell 4 capes to Billiton from RBCT to Rotterdam and again  buying 
same deal with Coeclerici as a back to back with some profit.


OTC 
FFA s
No trades
      
EOL
No trades this week but EOL trader joining our group Thursday and new routes 
to be added shortly which should add liquidity and new players.

Miscellaneous
Our position as it stands now is short about 350,000 tons for balance of 2000 
mostly attributed to our November/December Colombia/LBT panamax short.  For 
cal 01 we are 6.2 million tons short and cal 02 1.7 million short and cal 03 
about 400,000 tons short.  These figures do not take into account our two 
Coeclerici cape deals as those have not been finalised with counterparty and 
have not been booked as of yet

Travels
Pierre is in Asia all week and I am in the office

I would wait.  Otherwise if we bring him in now and he gets offer, then we 
would have to place him elsewhere for his first six months.  If you want him 
for a first rotation, it may make sense to wait until we get closer to 
February.

We will have a need for another associate in February and would be interested

a few months to interview him?  I don't think that Kevin has any immediate

We can bring him in for a round of interviews for the Associate Program.  If 
you have an immediate need and he passes interviews then its likely we can 
make offer now.  Confirm thats what you want and we will facilitate getting 
him in for interviews.

The attached resume comes highly recommended to us and it looks like he's got 
some very relevant experience to some of the things going on in EBS.  Kevin 
Howard and I would both be interested in talking to him about positions in 
our group, but it seems to make the most sense to bring him into the 
Associate/Analyst Program.  He's been out of school for 2 years and was one 
of the founders of Network Oil, a Houston based startup.  What is the best 
way to proceed with this?

That's a good idea.  If we get him in for interviewing, it would probably be 
a couple of months before he has an offer and starts - they'd probably just 
lump him in with the MBA recruiting and Super Saturday timing.  We'd 
definitely have an interest in talking to him about opportunities in our 
group to see if there is a fit.  Do you want me to work with the Associate 
program to try to make that happen?

Michelle:

This would be as an associate in the EBS program.  I am full right now but 
seemed like someone we would want in the family.  Louie Fischer is very high 
on him and she is typically a tough critic.  If we could get him in for 
interviews, we could consider placement and timing.

Any updates on the Gdansk refinery, or should I assume that the deal is dead?

Dear Mr. Shankman,
I guess I stumped you with my resume.  Nevertheless, I still would like to 
hear your comments - positive or negative.  As mentioned, I am extremely 
interested in working  for Enron and would like to pursue that jop 
opportunity.  
Look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
Rina

Hi guys,

Shawn Cumberlan, the former head of the CALME region, is very interested in 
learning about the transportation businesses we are pursuing.  He will be in 
London end of next week or so and I'd like you guys to spend some time with 
him.  

Dan, expect a call from him before he heads to London.  Mark Frevert is 
having him explore opportunities within the wholesale businesses.

Later,

Jeff

Thanks for the note.   We are still looking at the value chain, but think we 
may have an idea.  I think Mike and I learned a lot from you guys when we 
were in London.  Nobody thinks our speculating in the grain markets does much 
for us, and is probably the wrong way to run that group.  Interestingly, the 
cargill CEO hasn't met with us yet.  We have been trading softs, but very 
small.  Next time Gary Hickerson is in London, which should be soon, I'll 
have him give you guys the story, and ask for more of your input.  

Regards

Jeff

recently got some calls from former Cargill colleagues, it rumors fly around 
in that company that we are about to start trading softs tomorrow...they are 
also interested in stealing some EnronOnline ideas

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 44/2000




Highlight

The cape market is starting to show signs of weakening in the spot market as 
the Panamax market is trading at a discount to most major cape routes and 
charterers have started to split cape stems into two panamax stems.  As for 
next year, the cape market is still trading at robust numbers but the 
sentiment on the panamax market has definitely turned bearish as the massive 
new order of vessels and the lack of grain cargoes from the US is front page 
news everywhere.  We are now starting to see big grain houses really starting 
to sell the panamax freight market for next year.  We are also having several 
large owners calling us directly over the last few days to try to convince us 
to take their tonnage for next year or fix COA's.  We are short approximatly 
45 pananamx cargoes world wide next year.

The long term Coeclerici deal was finally concluded this week and booked for 
$1.3 Million.  We have another smaller deal with Coeclerici which we will put 
into the books within next week and are looking currently at repeating the 
same strategy on a smaller panamax vessel to be delivered in 2003/2004 with a 
purchase option included in the deal.  
Last week we added to our short panamax position for next year by agreeing to 
sell an additional 6 panamax cargoes to National Power ( now called Innogy 
).  In total we now have sold 12 panamax cargoes to Innogy from RBCT to the 
UK for 2001.  Further, we are in discussion with Intercore to sell them an 
additional 3 capes for Q4 2001 from Puerto Bolivar to Rotterdam ( we have 
already sold them 4 capes for next year ) and also discussing selling 3 capes 
or 6 panamax cargoes ( our option ) to Glencore for Q1 01 from RBCT to the UK.

On the EOL front, last week was an active week as we traded with EDF trading 
a total of 375,000 tons of sea freight and then on Friday, just before going 
home, Louis Dreyfus transacted 5 times on our new grain panamax route ( U.S 
Gulf/Japan ) for a total of 270,000 tons.

I asked him (and John Nowlan) to call you about this project that looks 
pretty cool.  I thought you could lend a hand.  (John Montcrief also does wet 
shipping for the crude and products group in London and works for Nowlan as 
well.)  It looks pretty interesting.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks....

What do you think of this:

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering most of 
the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross 
commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and 
promote aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in room 3321.

Dear Mr. Shankman,
? How are you doing? We met last week at the  undergraduate Enron 
presentation and discussed the possibility of an Enron/ESPN  deal that would 
enable television viewers to order old sporting events over the  television 
(similar to the Blockbuster deal). You told me to send you an email  around 
this time to follow up, so I can find out who to contact to get the ball  
rolling. Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my idea.
?
Sincerely,
Zachary Costello

Subject: CERA Monthly Oil Briefing - CERA Alert - December 20, 2000




TITLE: CERA Monthly Oil Briefing: Fundamentals Update 
E-mail Category: CERA Monthly Briefing 
CERA Knowledge Area: World Oil 

In the past two weeks, oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength 
that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages 
this winter. The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard 
to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil 
stock situation is at least stabilizing, even if stocks have not built 
substantially, and that, thus far, despite a few weeks of colder-than-normal 
temperatures, heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key 
US market. That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving 
speculative interest into the market. Furthermore, the potential for weakness 
in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001. 

The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that 
Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide, yet, the Iraqi export 
cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals. If the cutoff lasts 
through December, the effect will be pronounced-it would turn a projected 
fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) into a 
stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic 
because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions, and 
exports may again cease. At some point such a development would have a price 
supportive effect. 

CERA's price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch 
released in late November. Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or 
repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production, the projected average for first 
quarter 2001 is $29 per barrel for WTI. However, this outlook is based on 
OPEC's announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its 
production by the start of the second quarter. A failure to restrain output 
would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $27 WTI for the first 
quarter of 2001, with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in 
the first. The downward pressure results from the prospect of a 
larger-than-usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 
3.0 mbd-with a cut in OPEC output.

Iraq in a Twilight Zone 
As anticipated, Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UN-controlled "oil for 
food" program as of December 1 in protest over the rejection by the Security 
Council's sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule.*

Iraq's pricing was judged by the UN overseers, who monitor the export program 
and advise the sanctions committee, to be about 60 cents per barrel below 
comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that 
Iraq was seeking from buyers.

Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues, Iraq partially 
resumed exporting on December 13. Since then, about 1 mbd has been exported 
from the Mina al-Bakr terminal in the Persian Gulf. Prior to the shutdown, 
Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of 2.21 mbd for November, as 
compared with 2.08 mbd for the third quarter. Exports for November were about 
1.3 mbd from Mina al-Bakr and about 0.9 mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean. 
Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed, owing to the surcharge dispute, with 
the result that about 1.2 mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market.

Iraq's semi-shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its 
dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues. (In the midst of 
this dispute, the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oil-for-food 
program at the last minute on December 5; it became effective on December 6 
and has been accepted by Iraq). As of December19, Iraq's revised export price 
for Ceyhan, proposed for the remainder of December, has again been judged too 
low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions 
committee. Additionally, the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude 
that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow 
account would be a violation of UN sanctions. Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina 
al-Bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a 
surcharge to Iraq.

How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear, but it continues 
to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an 
apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are 
the heart of the sanctions system. The distinction that Iraq has made between 
Mina al-Bakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina al-Bakr by 
loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company. Iraq may have judged this 
accommodation to be in its interest, since it recently also signed an oil 
exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil. As 
currently structured, the deal would violate UN sanctions, but India is 
seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic 
hardship. The exception seems unlikely to be granted, which may lead Iraq to 
cease exports from Mina al-Bakr again.

There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow, but we expect 
uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as 
leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security 
Council to end all restraints. Consequently, the Iraq factor will remain an 
element in the oil price outlook. 

Iraq's antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq 
issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take 
office. Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a 
need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to "reenergize" 
sanctions. The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign 
policy-oriented think tank in Washington. A consensus seems to be emerging 
around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by 
retaining UN control over Iraq's oil revenue and strictly enforcing a 
prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general 
trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international 
irritant. There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to 
destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that 
the prospects for success are remote.

Demand Trends 
Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for 
gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so, 
and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas. Interruptible gas 
customers with resid or distillate fuel back-up have already switched to oil, 
so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the 
already high level of distillate demand. So far in December US distillate 
demand is running at a record high December level of 3.9 mbd. However, only a 
small portion of this demand is the result of economically based 
fuel-switching from gas to distillate. CERA estimates that the additional 
demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is 
relatively small, on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mbd. In CERA's view it is likely 
that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short 
notice because in some cases, this theoretically switchable capacity has not 
been used in recent years, and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in 
uncertain condition. 

Switching by interruptible gas customers (such as utilities) to distillate 
began about a month or more ago, although the volumes involved are relatively 
small. Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices 
started to surge in the summer. A portion of the US secondary and tertiary 
distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible 
gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage. Given the 
expectations of a tight gas market, regulators have been explicit about 
enforcing back-up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the 
current heating season. 

Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching. 
Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost 
of feedstock natural gas is high. Natural gas is also used in some enhanced 
oil recovery operations, and some of these producers have also opted to sell 
gas back to the grid rather than produce oil. 

Supply Trends 
Non-OPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0.9 mbd over a 
year earlier at 46.4 mbd. Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican 
production, curtailed in October by about 300,000 bd owing to the effects of 
Hurricane Keith. Mexico's fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 
3.64 mbd-about 95 percent of Mexican liquids capacity. Norway's output 
increased 200,000 bd from October to November as maintenance season ended. 
Norway's production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3.53 mbd.*

Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a 
recent surge in exports, in spite of higher export taxes. Russian exports of 
domestic oil production (excluding transit volumes) reached 2.5 mbd in 
November, after remaining fairly steady at about 2.35 mbd from July though 
October. Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2.5 mbd, 0.3 mbd 
greater than in the fourth quarter 1999.

CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged 2.91 mbd in November-down 0.1 
mbd from the October level. The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced 
Iraqi output for the first 12 days of December to roughly 0.8 mbd. Iraq 
resumed exports of about 1 mbd on December 13, which raised production to 
1.80 mbd. Assuming no change in Iraq's current production stance, Iraqi 
production would average 1.41 mbd for December. On a quarterly basis, the 
decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth 
quarter of 29.0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0.5 
mbd into a stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. These production estimates include 0.15 mbd 
of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November 20 without UN 
authorization and are continuing.

Oil Stocks 
US crude oil inventories (DOE data) have climbed intermittently from an 
annual low of 280 million barrels in September and reached 292 million 
barrels in mid-December (see Figure 1). Since prices weakened in late 
November, crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September 
and the ranges seen in October to levels from 289-292 million barrels.

Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below year-earlier levels; 
at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels, or 24 percent less, than 
those of a year ago, but there are indications of builds in secondary and 
tertiary inventories. We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 
5-10 million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at 
the end of last year.

In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with 
those of the United States. In November stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels 
to 426 million barrels. At this level they are below the highs of 1999 but 
well above the low levels of early 1996 (see Figure 2). Japanese crude oil 
inventories at end-October were 107.6 million barrels, which is above the 
record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent 
years (see Figure 3).

some of this number is just due to the ipe gasoil mkt closing before the 
brent.

I will highlight what is coming back in and where the money is lost by doing 
an appx m-t-m where the mkt is at this moment.

ipegasoil  +1.4
physical gasoil      .90
heat      -.20
brent      -.30
dubai     - .50
pnl clawback      +1.3

we have been reducing the risk in the book on a daily basis as you can tell 
from the var changes.  I need to go thru
with the person who does our book in houston how he arrived at last night 
numbers.  the losses on physical gasoil
seem to great to me so hopefully the money coming back in will be greater 
than my above estimate.

Jeff:
I'm working on the Enron case study for Harvard B-school and Cindy
Derecskey mentioned that you could help me.

When we met with Rick Buy, he mentioned that in 1994, when he joined Enron,
there were about 10 people in the credit group.  I'd like to get a sense of
how fast that group grew, and, as I understand, metamorphosed into a
sophisticated risk management group.  How many people are in the risk
management group now?

If you prefer to answer this vie phone, please feel free to call me at

Thank you!

Can you please identify for me by return Email or phone (66474) the person on 
your staff to whom I can speak regarding the services your company provides 
for Enron customers?

I am putting together a short presentation on "Other Enron Services" for a 
conference our TECASO group is hosting to discuss/promote our planned on-line 
lender's engineer due diligence services amongst numerous major financial 
institutions in early February.  The purpose of this"Other Enron Services" 
agenda item is simply to take the opportunity to summarize the multitude of 
services offered by Enron for those in attendance who may not be familiar 
with some or all of these services.  Accordingly, I'm in the process of 
gathering information on the various services Enron has to offer and, in 
particular, slides/viewgraphs covering the services offered by your company 
which may already exist in order not to have to duplicate prior efforts. 

Thank you in advance for your attention to this request.

Regards,

Ed Hlopak, Sr.

I was planning on changing the morning meeting as you indicated.  

The problem with the P&L loss is one of time.  We have given back 25 million 
this quarter, and very few traders took profits at any time.  I expect 
traders to lose money at times, but we have other constraints.  I'd be happy 
to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will 
get to our numbers next year. Of course spread trading is a good idea, but 
when I look at the portfolio in aggregate, the position story I'm being told 
doesn't make sense.  
We'll get there.

Subject: Re:  

The issue of making the morning meetings more inspiring is a challege we need 
to take up.  I would suggest we move to traders
telling what the main positions are in their books (3 max) and then give a 
bullish (max +2) to bearish (max -2) view of their mkt.  If we
moved more quickly through this we might have time for more meaningful 
discussion at the end.  I think that the discussion at the
end we can keep flexible but for instance when we have major issues like spr 
sales or an opec meeting we should delegate somebody
to do a review of that.  In terms of the wed meeting, unless there is 
something special, I would recommend letting the new research
analyst we have hired in London do a quick API review.

The issue of high volatility in the markets makes a good argument for 
lowering position sizes but the issue of not having
any money to lose won't ever go away.  I base that statement on the premise 
that with the budget for next year set at 175 million
we will always be under pressure to meet budget and not give back any 
profits.  The books that have historically made the most
money in enron global products have been more spread trading/view oriented 
rather then flat price/momentum oriented.  I know
you would prefer we move away from this and become more the latter but I 
would encourage you to consider the fact that we have
little edge in forecasting short term price movements but hopefully have 
enough staying power and experience to position ourselves
correctly for the big moves.

It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  

Thanks.   Jeff

Hi Ben,

No problem if you want to invoice me.  I'm not ready for you to ship the 
goods to me, though, and probably won't be for a few weeks, as I move into 
the new digs.  Still thinking about the lamp and desk.....

the dragonfly table (I already sold the other one), the pair of Guimard
pots, and the Robalbhen ceramic apple.  Also on the list:
1. Galle "saggitaire" tri-cornered table, which has been sold (blame my dad)
2. the Tiffany lotus bell lamp, which was 59,000 and we told you 52.
3. The very tall Rozenburg iris vase, which was 14,000 and we told you 12.
4. The Rozenburg with 2 butterflies that looks like Gustav Klimt, $6,500 to
$5,750.
5. The Mougin ceramic of 3 mice and a bug, 1,950-1,700
6. The Galle desk that has waited for you 95-79 and that's a lot of love.

what do you think?

Dear Jeff:

Hello! I wanted to make a bill for you for  the table and ceramic pieces,
is that ok?


Can you be in Washington on October 28?   There's a great day-long
symposium in conjunction with the Art Nouveau show  (which I saw on Friday,
and which is, incidentally, much bigger and better than  the one in London
was) which I'm going to, and I would love to be able to tour  around the
show with you. Also, Macklowe Gallery is having a cocktail  party that
night for our clients, friends, experts, and assorted fabulous  hangers-on.
You'll get an invite in the mail, but I wanted to give  you advance notice
since I know how hectic your schedule is.

I hope it was an easy and meaningful fast for you,  and that this year
brings you happiness beyond your wildest  imagination.
Tell me what's up
love.
ben

Subject: Singapore Responsiveness

John:
 I want to bring a matter to your attention. Last week I went to see Canadian 
Steamship Lines. Prior to my visit I asked Vikas, the middle marketing 
associate, to contact Singapore and get quarterly offers for IFO 180. Vikas 
emailed Hans Wong three times.  He also called twice. I also asked  Sarah 
Mulholland to call Singapore on Friday prior to start of my meeting. She 
could not reach Hans either in the office or on his cell phone. We finally 
received some numbers Monday morning, obviously too late for our client 
meeting.

I understand that you have been working very hard to increase responsiveness 
and market development for crude and products.  With this in mind, I  believe 
have a partial solution  that will prove beneficial to all. On the EGM 
fundamentals page I intend to include a section where the mids of all 
products will be posted based on the day's close. I think this would help 
everyone stay on top of the various markets and products around the world.

Thanks for your attention to this matter.

It's not necessarily an either/or decision.  Michelle, do you think this is a 
good program?  Kristin, can you call Tom Piazze at Wharton, and ask him what 
he thinks about the importance of our participation in this?

Here is another conference we can participate in.  Would you rather do this 
conference or the entrepreneurship conference?

Hi Kristin

I am following up on our conversation earlier with respect to Enron
participating in the Whartons Finance conference and the evening
reception known as Bullish on Finance.

I think this forum will be a great opprotunity for Enron to reach
the students interested in finance and it also provides a great platform
to talk about Enrons unique position in the global financial
community.

Please do consider the option of sponsoring a panel at the Gold level.
It provides a great value and essentially a full panel "ownership" to
talk about Enrons acitivities.

I would like to touch base with you early next week to hear you thoughts
and feedback on these proposals.

Looking forward to a great conference participation.

Kind Regards
Suresh

Hey Jeff, 

I don't know--- you tell me?  How many people would you like to attend and 
who out of the listed participants would you like to attend?  I will be more 
than happy to give those a call who  you feel no longer need to 
participate.   When I spoke with Sarah M.  she was trying to get Sarah W. to 
come.  Sarah W.  is not confirmed therefore she can easily be removed from 
this event.  Let me know what you would like to do.

I know you guys have been working to secure supply for the H. Galleon.  I 
wonder if we should do some sort of tender for fob princing, allowing us 
whatever freedom we want with the ship.  I'm not sure we should kill 
ourselves for a few pennies--I'd even let the ship stay empty and maybe force 
some of our will on the LNG market if possible, in effect creating more of a 
spot market.  Maybe EOL.   Any thoughts?

Jeff

I met with Carlo (as did several other Enron employees) last week and we are 
talking to them about a number of ideas.  One of which is detailed below 
(from them) and has technology and paper/lubmer points.  I believe Carlo from 
Dow will be calling you guys shortly.  Take a look at the attachment and 
you'll understand the points he's making that are relevant to your 
businesses.

Jeff, thanks for agreeing to make the introduction with Philip and Ray. I
have attached below a summary of Buildscape(Driving to Liquidity) as well a
high level PowerPoint presentation on Buildscape.

As you are aware, we have had introductory meetings with Rob Scheuer from
the Industrial markets, Brandon Wax, John Pavetto and Rahil Jafry. There is
interest in Buildscape from the group and Rahil has offered a sweat equity
option. Rob advised that he would come back to us in the shortly on his
thoughts around a strategic relationship.

We see the possibility of a broader strategic opportunity combining
technology functionality from the Networks Division, risk and credit
management tools available through your market making initiatives, as well
using the Buildscape providing an efficient channel to market for Enron
products and services in the Building industry and the home. In order for
this opportunity to receive senior management attention and to talk through
the possibilities, we will contact Philip Bibi and Ray Bowen shortly as per
your recommendation.

Could you confirm back that you have passed on the information so that we
don't surprise either of them on the topic and we will aim to arrange a
meeting with them in Houston in the next couple of weeks. We may call on
your help to sponsor the meeting if required.

In the meantime, we will press on with confirming the Dow/Enron April 27th
meeting in midland to pursue Chemicals and Plastics opportunities and we
would be very pleased if Mark Fievert can attend as well. If we need to move
the date slightly to accommodate Mark, then lets talk through the options.
Thanks.

winter season in Europe, 
it is very useful information for us to get a commentary from professionals.

It would be good to get such an extensive report from time to time, or 
whenever a major change in the weather pattern take place.
On a day to day basis, is it possible to get a short comment on your opinions 
on the weather situation in Europe.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,

Subject: Europe Winter Weather

Frank,

Here is an outline of what Mike, Jose and I put together today concerning the 
remainder of the winter across Europe:




The Bottom Line:

Much of the continent should feature temperatures, on average, cooler than 
the past few months.  Overall temperatures should be normal to below normal 
in the February and March timeframe.  An active sub-tropical jetstream will 
continue to provide a wet pattern near the Mediterranean keeping temperatures 
on the below side of normal.  Western Europe will also see the best chances 
for colder weather intrusions as the NAO trends positive.  Even with this 
cooler trend across Europe, there are no signs that the Arctic Pool of air in 
Siberia will move westward toward eastern Europe.  Overall no extreme 
deviations from normal are expected, only a slight trend toward cooler than 
normal.

Let me Know if there is more we can do:

Jeff - Franz Klem of EVN is a good friend of mine - and most recently our 
best customer for coal in Austria.  He is real pissed at the way our LPG team 
has handled the Sinopec Jingling Petchem business, and made it clear to me 
that he is looking for us to hop in and lend a hand.   EVN has done business 
with the project, and apparently have had positive results to date.

The "Manfred" mentioned in his email is Manfred Ungetheum of our office in 
Germany.  I would appreciate your checking into what is going on, and why we 
are not paying proper attention to these guys. 

I will be in on Monday.  Thanks.

George

Dear George,

I was pleased to see you in Madrid unfortunately we had to less time for
some beers or wodkas. At the moment I am out of office for another two days,
today we have a state holiday and tomorrow I will take one day off. I have
to keep up my golfing a little bit.

George, you promised me to have a look at the LPG deliveries to China, the
situation again is as follows:

My very good friend Wolfgang Hofer has good contacts to the SINOPEC JINGLING
PETROCHEMICAL Corp., Najing, China. They plan the retrofitting and enlarging
of their polypropylen capacities for about 120.000 mtons/year. As a raw
material they need LPG and the production should start at the beginning of
2001. They want a longterm contract for 300.000 mt/y with increasing option
to 400.000 mt/y. Further they are looking for a delivery already this year
50 to 60.000 mt.
Mr. Cheng Zu Shan, the chief of planning and finance dept. was already in
Vienna and met Wolfgang Hofer. Manfred introduced Wolfgang to Tracy Wallace
and than to Eric Hanson and now we are waiting for any answer from ENRON
since weeks.

May be it is interesting for ENRON because there will be a second trading
option when Jingling offers you the products.

Please George have an eye on that business because Wolfgang has to answer
his Chinese partners very soon.

Herewith I send the name and address from Wolfgang, for the direct contact
to him:

Mike/Jeff,

I met with Jim Bernhard, Chairman, President and CEO of the Shaw Group, who 
owns Stone & Webster (see below) on Monday and he gave his blessing to move 
forward asap with a crude supply and/or product off take JV at the Orion 
refinery in Norco, La. I am going to NYC in early November to meet with First 
Boston and see how real this opportunity could be and whether we want to 
enter into an MOU with Shaw. I have been keeping Larry Lawyer advised and he 
is willing to help the process any way possible.

Larry,

I am working with Stone & Webster, a large EPC company who wants Enron Global 
Fuels to work with them regarding the crude oil supply and refined products 
offtake at a refinery in Norco, La. This is a 200,000 barrel per day refinery 
capable of using heavy crude oil and has a 75,000 barrel a day coker unit. 
They own a 12.5% interest in the Orion refinery (formerly called Goodhope) 
and Credit Suisse and First Boston own a combined 68% equity share. Jack 
Stanley, who was involved in this refinery in the past has no current or 
future ownership or involvement in the refinery. I told S&W that it was a 
prerequisite that Mr. Stanley not be involved in any way before I would send 
them a standard ENA confidentiality agreement and start preliminary 
discussions about our role with the refinery. So far they have neither 
offered, nor asked Enron for any equity involvement, but rather are focused 
on us proposing physical liquid fuels and risk management structures. 

I am waiting for S&W to schedule a meeting in Baton Rouge with their top 
management to discuss their plans and how we can assist. Hopefully, this will 
lead to something tangible and I will bring you into the picture so we can do 
some kind of financial structure or equity along with, or in lieu of, the 
supply/offtake angle. I realize refineries have been a non-starter with Mr. 
Skilling, but with good crack spreads and new management within EGM maybe 
there is a possibility here. 

Please keep this very confidential. 

Regards,
Doug

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Christopher Handte

NOTICE:  CABC reports contain sensitive information and are not for general 
distribution


The Saudi oil minister is now saying that if Iraqi export volumes do not 
return to normal (as assumed in the recent OPEC production cut), OPEC might 
actually increase output at the March meeting.    This seems to reflect fresh 
doubts about Iraq's speedy return to the market.

Despite reports that loadings are resuming at Ceyhan, our sources believe 
that Iraqi export volumes are likely to remain below normal levels.  These 
sources assess that Iraq is continuing to insist on the surcharges.  Some 
companies will steer clear of any Iraqi oil; others will try to find a way to 
resume exports without being accused of paying a surcharge.  In any case, it 
will be difficult for Iraq to ramp up to 2 mb/d by Feb 1 as projected by a 
SOMO official at the OPEC meeting last week.

Bayoil has reportedly signalled that Iraqi exports are likely to resume 
normal levels by the end of the month.  However, sources advise that Bayoil 
is considered to be an unconventional player compared to the traditional 
major lifters of Iraqi crude, and it is an especially aggressive buyer of 
Iraqi oil.  It may be willing to do business with Iraq sooner than the more 
established players.  Therefore, it might be incorrect to assume that firms 
are ramping up Iraqi liftings across the board based solely on indications 
from Bayoil.

Iraq averaged around 600,000 b/d in December.  According to news reports, 13 
mb of Basra Light and 4 mb of Kirkuk have been exported so far in January.

Subject: Garcia Munte / Spain


The situation of this file, which was on the last leg , is suddenly 
worsening.  (cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :  19 million oct 
3rd  / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,  zeroing in november  as 
we have stopped deliveries to GM  - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti 
cargoes direct to the third parties) .
Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where 
combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of 
terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the 
above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to 
be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to 
sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being 
unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic  
inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in 
the early 2000.   
As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name 
(and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more 
documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk 
that a Spanish liquidator contest our position.
We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by 
GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to 
continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and 
stop payments...

GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and 
save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without 
increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for..

We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to 
accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential 
buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC 
Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be 
in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company 
cannot get sold.

Thanks
Michel

Jeff/Larry,

To follow up on my voicemail, the Associate and Analyst Program is in great 
need of interviewers for October 28th and November 4th Super Saturdays.  
These weekends are the most critical at this time.  To date, we are in need 
of an additional 38 interviewers for October 28th and 67 for November 4th.  
In order to have a successful recruiting season, we would greatly appreciate 
your assistance in getting more EGM executives to participate in this 
effort.  Please contact me at x39233 with any questions.  Thanks for your 
continued support.

Subject: EOL Products

Following are my sugestions for the next three EOL gasoline products;

1. 2nd month NYMEX UNL
2. MTBE front month swap, U S Gulf fixed price.
3. Cal 02 UNL gasoline crack spread (this one probably requires VAR increase)
4. WTI swaps that match the timing of our gasoline and HO cracks. This gives 
customers the option to convert crack spread positions to fixed price 
gasoline and HO swaps through EOL.


Regarding long dated gasoline positions we are long 75 kb per month cal 02 
gulf coast gas cracks which probably won't move much in value until 
march/April 01. I view this position as very low risk and good profit 
potential but this position does tie up VAR. If marketing can sell at $3.80 
or better happy to get out of this for now. This is the only long dated 
position in my book.

I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG 
job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him 
coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side 
provided you are happy with the numbers.

Louise

ps Robert please send Jeff the Jonathan numbers.

 When I was in your office you rattled me a quite a bit when you said you 
weren't ready to ask me a certain question.  I know that you and I have not 
had the chance to really talk lately and I've actually been in and out of the 
office in the late afternoons trying to get some health issues resolved.  I 
want to let you know I'm trying very hard to focus and work with Niamh in 
London, learn as much about reisd, and trade into what we think are solid 
positions.  So far I feel like its been going better than I even expected, 
but I know I have a lot more to learn.  I'm enjoying this product and working 
in EGM.  I'm trying to manage this Penn thing on the side and still help out 
Jenn and Fundamentals when they need it.  I'm begining to see what it means 
to be streched thin, something I'm sure you experience quite often.  I do 
want you to feel like you can ask me anything.  I'm here to express my ideas 
to you or if you feel like I'm not working hard enough, I'd like to know.  
I've really appreciated everything you've done.

Alhamd,

Thank you for your information and interest in this area.  Rick Bergsieker 
and Clay Harris are already in discussion with the Egyptian Energy Ministry 
for possible participation by Enron in a liquifaction project.  Please feel 
free to exchange ideas and thoughts with Rick and Clay directly.

However, in order to avoid creating any confusion with our Egyptian counter 
parts I strongly prefer to only have our current commercial team involved 
these discussions at this time.  

Regards,
Eric Gonzales

Subject: Egypt LNG

Eric,

Hoping all is well,

Wanted to have a quick chat with you, when you are next in Houston, about the 
Egypt LNG opportunity.  I had a meeting with the minister and the deputy 
minister for technical affairs and both were intereseted in increased 
participation in the LNG field in Egypt.  They are interested in diverse 
off-takers, and are interested in investing in new facilities (EGPC would 
like to own 60% of such a new facility and local/Arab investors can be found 
for the remaining equity).  They know they don't know how to project finance 
such deals, and they know they need a strong international name as an (at 
least partial) off-take.  They alluded that the situation with Finosa, 
although progressing, is not as it appears in the press.

At any case, I believe we have enough elements to warrant a 
conversations--and I have good contacts in Egypt that could help push such a 
project forward.

Cheers'

Hamd

hey there.  freak show central here.  this week is bad, unfortunately.  
florida was awsome...and it put me in the mood to get back on the diet, and 
exercise.  did you buy that watch?  you should leave the office now and get 
it if you didn't, and on your way back, you should stop for a tennis lesson!

I had my best tennis lesson yesterday!  I just wish that I could play more.  

let me know if you have any free time this week to get together with Mish and

Tony Hamilton Key Strengths
Quick thinker
Good teams skills
Driven - will be able to get the project off the ground quickly
Has a commercial attitude
Sees "the big picture"

Tony Hamilton is available for follow up interviews the first week of January.
Thanks

Regarding market development opportunities for EOL, I believe there is a huge 
market possibility for a Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) to become a or the 
benchmark. LLS should be the price discovery market for the Atlantic basin 
crude oils. Wti should not be the market and neither should Dated brent. I 
think there is a unique opportunity at present to pursue this. Most market 
participants are not content to used dated as a benchmark, particularly after 
the latest squeeze  by Arcadia.. Wti is perceived to be too manipulated by 
B.P. I would like to set up a meeting soon to discuss my thoughts. Please let 
me know when everyone would be available. How about tomorrow @ lunch?

Subject: ARA Coal Mkt Summary

MKT SUMMARY

Despite the fact that we have seen some cargoes offered for resale in ARA mkt 
for nearby delivery thru to Q1 this week the tone of the mkt 
remains very firm. EDFT, seemingly still unsure of it's burn schedule one 
week to the next had a spot cape to find a home for if he could replace 
with tonnage from either ourselves or the mkt for December delivery. We 
offered equivalent of $39 cif ARA but they chose to take her themselves 
and two port her into Le Havre and Montoir which shud highlight the inability 
to extract from the mkt anything better than $40.50-$41 cif for delivery
December period. Indeed, due to rescheduling Anker Coal were offering some 
South African material into ARA for Nov shipment which we
showed some interest in but they claim to have unloaded it at $40.75 on a cif 
basis. Thus the direction and structure of the ARA mkt continues
to reflect what we are seeing in both the FOB origin and frt mkts - there is 
no incremental tonnage available out of Australia for Europe as producers 
look to take advantage of a soaring Pacific prices. Many were already well 
sold as the mkt really took off and hence are actively trying to fulfill old
European contracts from elsewhere in order to free up some bullets. Certain 
South African producers claim to be sold out until the New Year and
Drummond continues to struggle with getting their shipment schedule back on 
track stating that it won't be until May next year that they are fully 
back on track again. While there is not a huge amount of open demand thru to 
the end of the year anyone who finds themselves entering the 
spot mkt from here on in will have to dig deep into their wallets. Q1 01 
still proves to be a very interesting period where on the supply side 
we will still be experiencing all of the above mkt factors but where there is 
also still a substantial amount of open demand to be satisfied. Still
could see some fireworks and a steeper inverse than what we see today with Q1 
01 at $41.50 fob and Jan/Dec 01 at $41.25 - watch this space.

SPOT TRADES     

While we have worked towards procuring some spot tonnage thru various 
channels it has been a week without any spot business. As per
above the mkt is fairly well covered for nearby tonnage and sentiment of the 
buyers is to remain very hand to mouth for final requirements
rather than pay these high prices in advance. We are also not too aggressive 
at mkting what material we have unsold in stock or arriving
later in the year as we are confident that the mkt will give us handsome 
returns as we move further into the winter months and those spot
buyers are eventually forced to the table.

SELLING SIDE

Mission still have not covered their December requirements. Our offer of 1.46 
GBP per GJ delivered Ferrybridge and 1.28 GBP FOR 
Hunterston were only valid until Friday but they claim to hold on offer of 
1.30 delivered Ferrybridge for Polish material. We said that
he shud be filling his face at that level and if we could have some aswell 
that wud be very kind. The sage continues!
We have agreed in principle to a five year supply agreement with Stadtwerke 
Bremen for between 850mmt - 1mil tonnes per year
starting Jan 01. Prices will be linked to the BAW Index.
HEW/VW combined are tendering for 270,000mt for Q2 shipment into Hamburg. We 
have offered $42.50 cif.
Electrabel looking for 50mmt each month 2001. 
EDFT continue to look for some cover for Q1 01.
Veag - 300mmt cif Rostock for Nov00/Jun 01
Endesa - 4 capes for 2001.
H del C was interested in spot cargo we were looking at and still working 
various possibilities of swapping material for 2001.
While we hoped Coe Clerici may be suitable counterparty to sell us Russian 
coal going forward they are looking for us to sell them
some sort of structure which will limit their Russian short going forward!
Fenosa - 250mmt of Low Vol U.S material for 2001 but so far unable to get an 
offer basis this material.
Innogy looking for upto 1mil tonnes for delivery throughout 2001
Bewag still have tender out for 500mmt for next year where we are looking to 
put a proposal to them basis Polish material.


BUYING SIDE

Continue to work Emerald for material out of the U.S. - hopefully persistence 
will pay and we may close something this week for 2001 
shipments.
Bot a further cargo from Masefield for Q1 shipment FOB Santa Marta at $32 
basis 11800btu/lb
Ensham had a lower quality coal (cape quantity) on offer at $25.30 fob Oz but 
unfortunately the specs make it a much more difficult prospect
to find a home for.
Possibility of buying some bits and pieces ex Maputo for Q1 which would 
equate to somewhere in the region $41 cif ara. Would be good
to test viability of shipping thru this port.
In tandem with 5 year agreement to supply Bremen with coal we have agreed a 
five year Agency Agreement with German counterparty
whereby he will procure Polish coal for Enron for shipment against our Bremen 
obligations.
NCSC - looking at feasibility of swapping or buying outright South African 
material for 2001.


EOL

What started as a fairly quiet week ended as our best and most exciting week 
yet. Between Thursday and Friday we did 16 trades via
EOL equating to just over 300,000mt. Glencore was the main sponsor of the 
action on Friday, intent on driving prices higher they were
a net buyer on the day and are no doubt testing our ability to act as a 
physical market maker and hence deliver against our commitments
with no coal assets as a backstop! Life to date we have traded 950,000mt on 
EOL so hopefully all going well we shud surpass the 1mil 
mark this week. 
We shud be in a posn where we can roll out our options against the SECA at 
Coaltrans in two weeks time.

GAMEPLAN

Running the risk of sounding repetitive our focus must remain on securing 
tonnage to play with for next year. To date our Drummond long has
been the only real ammunition we have and there is little security of supply 
out of Puerto Drummond for the first 6 months of next year. With the
demand that we have on the table today we could turn our 1 mill long into a 
short with no problem at all.  While there will always be a level
where one is happy to short a market I wud feel very uncomfortable doing so 
at the traded levels for 01 today despite the absolute levels 
being the upper end of the historic range. We still have a little way to go 
to actually signing contracts which secures us the 5 year deal 
with stadtwerke Bremen but  on the assumption we do we must start looking at 
our supply strategy for the first 6 months of next year where
it looks to be most challenging. The business we will be fantastic for 
creating flows into Germany and ARA and with the guarantee that we
can supply 10% of the total volume as Petcoke it will certainly act as the 
springboard for launching us into this tightly controlled mktplace.

Best Regards
Jez

Subject: Japan - Asia markets

Mike - 

Thanks for your voice mail of Friday regarding your trip to Tokyo.  As we 
have discussed we are in the process of identifying a strategy and forming a 
team to lead our Asian coal efforts.  

We view continental Europe and Japan / Asia as the next areas of growth for 
our group.  One of our greatest challenges has been identifying and 
attracting to our group the best "Enron" people, and strong industry 
players.  We have made some progress with the recent addition in Houston of 3 
- excellent mid-marketers with industry backgrounds.  However we are still in 
the process of building a strong European organization, and staffing Sydney 
with a core group of Enron traders and industry mid-marketers.  

Clearly Japan represents the single largest market for coal in Asia.  The 
other major markets are Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and to a degree India.  The 
largest coal exporters in the region are Australia, Indonesia, China and 
Russia.  Our staffing strategy for Asia is to initially build a core trading 
and marketing group centered around 2 - 3 experienced "Enron" guys in Sydney, 
add  mid-marketers with industry experience in Sydney and Tokyo, and hire  2 
- locals in China to look after our deliveries from PRC suppliers.  

Our experience to date has shown that industry guys orphaned in a regional 
office face certain failure. As a result we are trying to avoid the mistake 
we have made in the past of hiring local industry players, and then failing 
to provide them with proper direction and support. 

We are on target to relocate at least 2 - "Enron" guys to Sydney by Jan - 
Feb.  We will continue to search for strong industry guys in Sydney, and make 
any necessary changes to our existing structure there.  We have not yet 
started to identify qualified people with industry experience in Tokyo - but 
will obviously do so.  I will get with Stu and Joe to discuss using a local 
head-hunter, and advertising in trade journals etc.

We share your views on our potential for growth in Asia and Japan, and are 
working to put a team in place that will be focused on developing a strongly 
competitive, sustainable  business in the region.  Our initial goal is to 
develop Asia to the point where Sydney is running it's own books for both 
coal and freight, and we are a major supplier in the region.

Stu and I will be in Hong Kong and Beijing Oct.  7 - 11 to meet with the 
Chairman of Shenua Coal, and senior management of Shanxi Coal, China Light & 
Power, and Hong Kong Electric.  The primary purpose of the trip is to 
encourage Shenua to perform in accordance with their obligations under our 
supply agreement; introduce ourselves to Shanxi; assure CLP that we will 
perform under our term sales agreement; and start negotiations with HKE for a 
term sales contract.

I will coordinate my schedule with Joe, and will spend a few days in Tokyo 
(Oct. 12 - 13) at the end of the PRC trip.  We can coordinate our efforts, 
put a time line in place for staffing the Tokyo office with qualified coal 
guys, and discuss our overall strategy for entering the Japanese market.

I will be in the office Mon. - Weds., and am available to meet with you and 
Jeff to discuss the above at your convenience. 

 Thanks,

George

Thanks for the updates.  They are great.  I have a question about 
confirmation process.  How many votes in the Senate are needed to confirm.  
The Dems are saying they may try to indefinitely delay hearings on Ashcroft.  
How so?

I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete 
for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased 
expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This 
was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece 
of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners 
going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we 
do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.  
Maybe I don't understand it all.

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Jeff,

HTC got back to me saying that they are interested in having me rotate to 
their group. They want me to schedule a brief meeting with Steve Horn to let 
him know that I will be the next Enron person over there. My only concern is 
that they would like me to get there a bit earlier than scheduled (probably 
around 15 to 30 days before). I am extremely interested in this rotation but  
hope that transferring early does not create any problems. Do you have any 
suggestions on how I might tackle this issue?

Thank you so much for everything

Massimo

MKT SUMMARY

The producers did not dissapoint at Coaltrans with evidence as early as 
Monday afternoon that they had managed to whip up
a bullish frenzy amongst most of the industry participants. However the fact 
remains that fundamentals have changed little 
in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this 
mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a 
firm hold on the market throughout Q4 and Q1 2001. Indeed with the ocean frt 
market still steeply inverted for the winter versus
the rest of the year ( $11 versus $9.50 RBCT/ARA) and with the U.S mkt 
experiencing a massive squeeze front end (east coast
trading $35 fob barge) there is little sign of relief in the short term - Q1 
2001 Fob ARA is now trading close to $44 with Jan/Dec
2001 around $43.25. Producers will of course lead us to believe that the 
origin markets are structured in a steep contango for
the remainder of the year, however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation 
aside there is little in the mkt to justify this - if anything
demand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down 
and the financial markets under pressure and forecasts
for European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year. While a marked 
sell off for second half of the year is unlikely we
see the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than 
contango. This said we cannot preclude a shift higher
of absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around $33 
Fob South Africa equivalent to $35 - there is still
plenty of business to be done for 2001 and my feeling is that consumers will 
end up buying into it rather than risk the wait and
see game - we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that 
the cartel hold and even if this is exaggerated
it's implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology.

SELLING SIDE

British Energy - pitching a 1,3 and 5 year deal to them as an extension to 
current contract we have with them which runs out
end March.
Scotts Power - looking to turn present Feb cape commitment from CIF to  FOR 
deal and sell incremental cape for March 
arrival.
H Del C - offering them a 9 year put option basis the SECA.
Endessa - we have offered them 4 plus 1 cape business  for 2001 based on $31 
Fob South Africa.
NCSC - looking at doing various geographical swaps and they will be utilising 
EOL in the next week to hedge some of their 
implied short position.
Heidelberger - offered them a hdymax of South African material CNF Turkey for 
November delivery at $47.50.
Bremen - shud sign within the month an eight year deal with Stadtwerke Bremen 
supplying them some 850,000mt of generic
quality coal on an annual basis.
Bewag - currently working an offer to supply 1 million mt for 2001 on 
delivered stockpile basis
ENBW/Neckarverke/Preag - offering Oz material for Nov/Dec just shy of $43 fob 
ARA.
Braunschweig - offered them 3 x 60,000mt for Mar/Jun/Jly delivery into 
Nordenham at $43.75 cif.
 Dyckerhoff - offered 4 x 15,000mt of generic South Africa material for 
April/November delivery at $43.50 fob barge.


BUYING SIDE

Duiker - Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us 
buying a cape a quarter for 2001 - they are due to get
back to us within the next few days.
Drummond - offered us a 5 year deal staring in 2002 at $35 Fob Colombia - 
thanks!!
Krutrade - working numbers to put an aggressive multi-year offer in front of 
Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russian
mkt at present - we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our 
portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag business
going forward.
Anker - talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for 
2001 - they are looking at somewhere around the $27 fob
Maputo level.
Masefield - currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa 
Marta for 2001.
Coal Procurement - talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out 
of Durban for 2001
Currently working with U.S. on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for 
2001 but currently remain $0.75 - $1.00 apart.


We currently have some 50mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in 
Amsterdan/Rotterdam to sell as fillers into backend
of the year and we have the M.V. Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov 
26 with 143mmt of Australian coal to sell into
the mkt.

EOL

Much of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from 
GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch 
an e-platform which will provide mkts against 3 Fob origin points and an ARA 
delivery point. Details of operational functionality
are scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they 
themselves do not know but general consensus reckons
it will be operational end of first quarter 01. Rather than see this as 
competition, if successful it could provide us with more access
to markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games 
to be had with the various producers.  

Total volumes for EOL to date are at 1,700,000mt. We have seen a lot of 
interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt 
conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money 
options. As volatility increases other non-traditional coal 
players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which 
increasingly volatility presents. Next project is to get quotes in Euros and
after that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL.

GAMEPLAN

We had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans - 75% of 
which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between
$30 and $31.50. Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and 
Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of South
African material to add to our Colombian long. Overall our position is some 
2.5 million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases -
our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is 
out there at current numbers - it is difficult to call this mkt
in either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any 
downside potential with a host of put options which the utilities
are keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment. After weeks of writing that we 
need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far better
shape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of 
diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond.
While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of 
an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning as
much flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options.

Best Regards
Jez

I understand, however, each book you assign to a trader will have a line so 
you and I can follow the performance of each book/trader.  Ok if you want to 
take over arb books, but they (positions and p&l will be your responsibility 
and will be judged by performance--like any other book/trader) must be 
managed without the team approach of books prior.    The 1 million Var 
applies to the line next to Ross's name on the p&l sheets.  I don't know how 
many people trade that book, but I assume it is only ross.  If ross get's 
bulled up at every sign of snow in london, all the more reason to get a 
weather guy hired asap.  

Small positions, and taking profit frequently is the key to turning this boat 
around.  

Later,   Jeff

Subject: Re: 1 mil var for london distillates  

jeff - in the anticipation of moving to a global book I have had the back 
office set-up individual books for all of the
distillate traders.  I had asked the traders two weeks ago to clean-up the 
book as much as possible as we 
approached year end so that we could break-up the book easily in early 
january.  unfortunately, they have
not done this and I had instructed all of the london distillate traders 
(koller,o'brien,talvitie) today that if they 
wanted any positions they were to let me know by the cob today because I 
would be liquidating the book this 
week.  the only thing I insisted they take is the otc diff swaps that are 
traded for the physical bbls they are 
all assigned to trade.   in the case of ross these are large positions but 
the back office is making those changes
tonight and we can see what the var of those positions is tomorrow.   the 1 
million var limit for london distillates we
will need to calculate by the sum of their 3 positions.   in regards to the 
book presently under ross I will 
get that down to 1 mil var but ask that you give me weds and thurs to get 
this done.  I will try to get this all done
by tomorrow and had been reducing the positions today.  I would like to get a 
var for the global distillate
book and will assume for now that the 1 mil will be for the 3 london 
traders.   I will assume ownership
of all of those positions in the koller distillate book from now on so that 
these these guys, and ross specifically, 
can clear their heads and start over with as close as possible to a clean 
sheet of paper.  I made if very clear
to them that starting over was a question of rebuilding credability and they 
should take great efforts to ensure
that any positions they liked was put on at a low risk entry point and with 
small volumes.  to get some of the 
losses clawed back from friday though I would like to make you aware that 
this book has about a 3.5 million 
dollar climb to just get back to breakeven for 2001.  lastly, I will also 
take over all of the positions in the london/
singapore and us/uk arb books.  I would like this book to be renamed - 
mahoney physical.   the koller
distillate book will be renamed mahoney financial.

Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls 
that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards 
are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the 
operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic 
measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  
Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored 
on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.

As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations 
to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

With regards to the situation in Iraq, we have close contacts with Bayoil, 
who is the largest lifter to the US. They remain very bearish the market 
,though they are sold out on their november arrivals they have a lot of 
barrels available in december. They feel the Euro situation will be of small 
impact and they are seeing business as usual for november loading. As a side 
note they are normally right about the Iraqi situation but last year they did 
have vessels waiting at Mina al Bakr when the Iraqis cancelled loadings. I'll 
let you know if they change their tune.

Good morning team,

First,  I want to thank you for helping with on campus interviews last week 
at Wharton.  

To conclude the process I have scheduled a meeting for Tuesday November 14th 
at 9am in room 11C2 to discuss candidate invites for Super Saturday.  It is 
imperative that we meet to discuss who you will be passing on to the final 
round of interviews.  With the holidays coming up the sooner we get letters 
out for invites the better our results might be for attendance.  If you can 
not make this meeting please call me as soon as possible at extension 53214.  
Otherwise I will see you tomorrow.

Natalie if you can please respond with a call in number we will patch you 
into the meeting.

Thank you,

Kristin Gandy

Thanks for the update.  I will be out due to the holidays through monday, but 
call me on my cell at 713 854 4952.  Where do you see the spv reporting, and 
clearly between you, me, gary, and mike, we can think this through.

Subject: Project X

Jeff

Below please see response from Chris Talbot regarding portability of system.  
To clarify my discussion with you last week, while Gary's oversight is a key 
part of the deal I am uncomfortable with Gary's comments to Chris that I have 
simply introduced the deal and that Gary will make the sole decision on this 
deal.

Jeff, these guys have been introduced to me on a personal basis and the 
discussions are based on a large element of trust.  I see the strongest 
potential for this project working under the SPV structure outlined in our 
discussions.  More importantly, I see a unique opportunity to develop the 
trading technology in a setting  removed from the typical structure (but not 
from controls).  To this end, I do not see the SPV reporting directly to Gary 
nor do I see viability of this project residing solely with Gary.

I will call you Monday to discuss the way forward including the final due 
diligence required to move forward or kill this project.

Paul

Hi Paul,

First, it is good news that the deal is not dead.

I have already asked (as part of my own due diligence) if CSFB would 
cooperate (without mentioning names) and the answer was a clear yes.

We have a new file server and some software fixes in place and the 
system 
platform makes the one you saw look like horse and buggy speed - it is 
very 
fast now. Pity Gary did not see it - it would have 
completely 
knocked his socks off.

Hope the Texas pow-wow was enjoyable.

I look forward to talking on Monday. Electricity got more expensive 
last 
week!

Chris

Dear Jay,

Here is the Jay Baker piece for our newsletter.  I like the way it
turned out.  I worked on it a bit...he is so proud of its humbleness and

ofcourse I love the fact that it is so understated but a few of his
initial comments were a bit much.  After all this house is extraordinary

quality   and as you know it is always harder and probably more
expensive to create something simple and elegant. See what you think and

call me or email with any changes and then we'll run them by Jay Baker.

Hope you love the house.

Julie

Marti asked me to poll the Board to see if there is a strong preference for 
meeting at a different time of the day than we have previously been meeting. 
Board meetings would still have to be scheduled for Mondays, since the Museum 
is closed to the public on that day, but could you indicate below if you 
would like to keep the meeting at 4 pm or possibly change it to Noon:

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for Noon

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for 4 pm

The results of the poll will be discussed at the November 20 meeting (still 
scheduled for 4 pm in Cullen).

Jeff,

Loren mentioned that you would be willing to forward my resume and bio along
to Enron Broadband and New Power Company.  After you have the chance to
review them, I would like to speak with you to get your feedback and a sense
of what both companies are currently planning.  Thanks in advance for your

Latest overview from our regular Tokyo source...

and the figurehead nominally in charge of things doesn=01,t really matter.=
=20

2. The bottom line is the Japanese are itching for another joint interventi=
on.
The weak euro is hurting Japanese export sales in the euro zone and beyond
and they would like to draw a line in the sand near 85 euros to the dollar
and 92 yen to the euro. Problem is, the United States =01) in the person of
Larry Summers =01) wants intervention used only as a tool of last resort, a=
nd
only when central banks can use the element of surprise to spook market
players into euro buying and maximize the bang for their buck.

3. Will the Bank of Japan participate in another round of massive euro buyi=
ng?
Yes, but only when the U.S. participates in full measure. At what level wil=
l
that multilateral intervention next occur? Very difficult to say. If the
Japanese and some in Europe had their druthers they would have been in ther=
e
this week. Most analysts say the market has drawn a line in the sand at 80
euros to the dollar and if the central banks let the euro sink below that
level they=01,ll have a devil of a time getting it back up.

Our judgement is that they have to act above 80. To try to narrow our
prediction beyond that would, I think, be foolhardy.

4. As to yen-dollar, we see some further yen weakness ahead for several=20
reasons.
The wave of bankruptcies  in Japan shows no sign of abating. And they=01,re
getting bigger, with Kyoei Life=01,s demise the largest yet (4.5 trillion y=
en).
While big bankruptcies are inevitable and some see a silver lining because
Japan is finally trimming the dead wood from its economy, the effect on
market sentiment has been grim. The Nikkei remains lost in a dark, dark woo=
d
for that reason, and in sympathy with the NASDAQ.

Oil prices and the events in the middle east are also dollar positive on
balance, because of the flight to quality and the fact that much of the
world=01,s oil is denominated in dollars. And the Japanese first half repor=
ting
season ended Sept. 30, taking away a big incentive for exporters to
repatriate dollars.

So we see a somewhat weaker range for the yen over the near term =01) let=
=01,s
call it 108-112, with a bias towards the bottom of that range. There=01,s s=
ome
heavy resistance to the dollar  around 111.73, this year=01,s peak. So whil=
e the
dollar might poke through 110 some time soon, the bulk of trading should be
in the 108-109 range.

Longer term, rising profits on the export and high-tech sectors and continu=
ed
strong capital investment will pull the economy slowly out of the woods. An=
d
we continue to look for a stronger yen next year.

5. On BOJ policy, don=01,t look for another rate increase any time soon. Th=
e BOJ
took a lot of flack for the timing of its August increase and they made the=

political point about independence. Our outlook is for an even keel on
monetary policy near term. No change at least through the end of this year.

6. Technology notes: Japanese semiconductor makers are set to announce stro=

The connection to EOL or other web applications will be as fast as it is now, 
as this is solely dependent on your network hardware (cables, network card, 
etc.)  The mgiration to Windows 2000 will not impact this in any way.  One 
thing I need to verify though, do you use Stack Manager with EOL?  I did not 
see any instances of it on your machine, but I just want to double-check, as 
this program will not work under Windows 2000.


Thanks

Jeff:

 During my assessment of your machine, I noted your current hardware 
configuration:
SP750 with Dual 800Mhz PIII processors
512MB RAM
Matrox Quad video card

We currently do not have hardware in stock that matches these 
specifications.  Our current practice is to prepare a machine that is like or 
better than the machine the customer has currently, then swap that hardware.  
The benefits here are minimal downtime and the ability to switch back to the 
old machine quickly if an application does not work correctly in Windows 
2000.  Because we do not have a machine of equal or greater speed in stock, 
here is what I propose:

Every machine we migrate is Ghosted.  By this, I mean we run a program called 
Ghost which takes a snapshot of the machine in its current state.  This image 
can then be put back on the machine or accessed to retrieve files or other 
data.  I propose we Ghost your existing machine, make a backup copy of that 
image (after verifying it works correctly), then re-use your current hardware 
with Windows 2000.  The risk here is that we cannot go back to Windows NT 
(your current system) as quickly if something does not work.  

If you would like to move ahead with this plan, please let me know.  
Otherwise, we will order a machine with the same specifications, but it will 
take some time to get here.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there 
were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial 
team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar 
recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 
contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless 
weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we 
are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting 
function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, 
given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, 
we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be 
accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in 
their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all 
responsibility going forward. 

I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.

Subject: The stats


Ahead of tonight's stats, I've gone through last week's numbers (note - DOE, 
not API) and a few things leap out as worth noting and looking for this week.

Despite the API numbers, and the Mexican hurricane, crude imports were down 
just 150 kb/d, just 40 of which was in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast). Although imports 
are down from the peak in August, they still lie at least 500 kb/d above 
recent years' levels.
Bizarrely, the SPR rose by 0.5 mbbls last week, and 70kb/d of imports were 
specifically allocated to SPR - partly offsetting the 4.5 mbbl commercial 
stock draw.
There is no sign yet of distillate demand slowing, rather it continues to 
climb, and is well into winter levels.
Distillate output is strong, due to very high yields, rather than high 
throughput.

What does this mean for stocks?

The refinery runs show we are well into the maintenance season, and crude 
stocks almost always rise this time of year. But if the weather disruptions 
did not show up in last week's DOEs, they may appear tomorrow. DOE crude 
stocks are 2.5mbbls above API.
With distillate demand still storming, and runs falling, we could be in for 
another week or two of distillate draws.
As a result of the yield and the runs, gasoline stocks will likely follow the 
seasonal pattern and fall once more. DOE mogas stocks are 3.5 mbbls below API.

The consensus appears to be for builds across the board, but some of these 
factors might argue otherwise. Some charts are attached illustrating the 
points.

Cool.  They sell their music CD's at the front desk.  They may even have two 
out.  Would you mind picking them up for me?  I'll pay you back, I promise.  
If you have time, check out the gym/pool/message in the basement of the 
hotel--it's great.  Also try to get a room overlooking the interior 
courtyard, and don't change money at the hotel--they'll bend you as only the 
french can. 
Have a great time.....and definitely hang out in the lounge of the hotel.
Jeff.

PS, would you mind swinging over to the Hermes and pick me up a 
briefcase?--they're about $5,000 or so.  Great, thanks.

Subject: Confirmation of Interest

Rick, fyi, we are contemplating signing a simple expression of interest 
letter with the Tampa Bay Port Authority for a potential site for an LNG 
Terminal to supply S. Florida markets.

Our development efforts to date have not been as focussed on T.B. as they 
have been on the Bahamas proposal.  However, we came across a potential site 
in the Tampa Bay port which meets many of our criteria for a terminal site  
(e.g. existing deep water port, sufficient acreage adjacent to the port, 
industrial zoning).  We have yet to test the rationale of injecting 
significant quantities of gas into that market location, but the port is 
willing to commit to exclusivity on their part until the end of the year.  In 
this period of time we can easily determine if the project makes sense.

I believe its a good defense against others making a similar move and we are 
committing to nothing and paying no dollars.

Please let me know if you concur.  The draft letter is attached below (I've 
got legal sign-off on it already).

Thanks

Jeff,

The LNG group currently has 4 development engineers where their reporting was 
previously into Haug.  I was wondering if within EGM, we had any other 
engineers that we could group these resources with in terms of reporting.  

If not, I would suggest that we make the most senior one group lead (Dave 
Glessner) and have them report directly to you or Mike.  Although these guys 
are currently focused on LNG activities, I know from experience with a couple 
of them they also have generalists capabilities.  In Europe, Brian Stanley 
leads this develop engineering effort where he represents the owner (Enron 
Europe).  He has dual reporting into Sherriff and Larry Reynolds (one of

If you could come back to me on this quickly it would be very helpful as this 
is the last thing we need to finalise in our group structure.

Thanks

From: Office of the Chairman@ENRON on 19/10/2000 17:24 CDT
To: All Enron Worldwide
cc:  
Subject: Organizational Changes

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.

jeff,we have bought approx. 2.75mmbbls. of dec crude and reduced heat cracks 
300mb. This means we should be close to our var limits
but not sure if under. Secondly,products has var coming from heat cracks (we 
got hit on EOL for 975 mb  on friday),jet swaps  (also EOL earlier
last week  of about 1mm bbl.),and some gasoline cracks in 2002.Otherwise our

I think Prebon is out of the business, largely.  Have you checked with John 
Nowlan regarding which brokers he would suggest?  I'm not sure PVM is the 
right broker for all of our crude needs.  What about United?

Recently we signed Letters of Interest (LOI's) with three brokers.  The 
letters contemplate our interest in providing these brokers with the ability 
to execute on behalf of their customers on EnronOnline.  Below are the terms 
of these transactions as outlined in the LOI's.  I have contacted many of the 
desk heads prior to entering into the LOI's and outlined the general terms of 
these transactions (J Arnold, J Nowlan, K McGowan, U Ek, S Hastings, K 
Presto,J Hawthorn).  We are also in discussions with the following brokers E 
D & F Man (US Gas and US Power), GFI (global gas, power, coal and emissions), 
PVM (European Crude and Products), and Prebon (world-wide gas & power).  We 
would appreciate if you could give us the names of additional brokers we 
could talk to that are active in your products.

Please pay particular attention to the Amerex terms which include the ability 
to initiate executions telephonically using website prices.  Enrons 
obligation to transact telephonically on website prices are good faith only.

they are trying to negotiate out of.

definitive agreements.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 38/2000




Highlight
Sold four capes to Preag for next year from Colombia to Rotterdam at $7.30 
and simultaneously bought four capes from Coeclerici at $ 7 to close out 
position at a $150,000 profit.  Fixed a Bocimar vessel for our October 
commitment to Electrabel from Puerto Bolivar to Hunterston at $8.10 and also 
fixed another Coeclerici vessel from Colombia to Rotterdam to cover our short 
to Preag in November.  Still have a late November short against Cargill from 
Richards Bay to Rotterdam to cover within the next couple weeks.

On the ABC front, met with Elcano ( largest Spanish shipping company ) to 
discuss a possible partnership to acquire ABC but quickly realised that they 
do not have the stomach for such a big deal.  However, did discover that they 
are quite active on the LNG side and are about to close on a LNG vessel 
purchase within the next couple weeks.  We are definitely going to stay in 
contact to potentially develop some alliances on the LNG side.

Late in the week heard that Bocimar had met with ABC not to purchase them but 
to discuss a pooling agreement.  From good sources were told that ABC had no 
interest in Bocimar's offer and therefore we are planning on meeting ABC to 
continue to express our interest in acquiring their fleet and more 
importantly to continue to frustrate Bocimars'attempt to control the cape 
fleet.     

We have completed our 'Enron Shipping' powerpoint presentation for EOL and we 
expect to have a shipping section within the EOL platform by mid next month 
in time for Coaltrans.  This new platform will allow our customers to log 
into EOL and go directly to our shipping web page to be able to trade with 
us.  Currently, customers have to access the international coal web page to 
access our shipping products which does not make sense to our customers

Also Pierre met in Paris with Usinor ( 3rd largest steel mill in the world ) 
to discuss some potential freight deals and also express our interest to sell 
them Synfuel next year to which they seemed quite interested.  Will revert to 
them with prices shortly.


Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Down	Down	Down
Cape Size	Flat	Flat	Flat


Panamax : Market fell all week long but not to a great extent due to some 
worry about delays in US grain shipping activity
Capes : After a furious rally last week the market was flat this week as 
owners and charters had fixed all their October requirements and were 
starting to discuss November business with neither side wanting to commit
Crude markets remaining still over $30 a barrel even with the US trying its 
hardest to make it deep into the mid twenties, has also continued to make 
owners unwilling to discount next years freight rates
Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed  2+1 geared panamaxes from Indo to Hong Kong for November to January 
2001 at $6.35.

Third parties freight deals
As mentioned above fixed with Preag, Bocimar and Coeclerici on Capes


OTC 
FFA s
Bought 75,000 tons from SK Shipping  from Colombia to Rotterdam at $ 8.15 for 
October settlement

EOL
Traded with Bocimar twice and with Klaveness once this week.  Life to date 
total EOL trades are approaching 300,000 tons.  Legal late this week has 
finally authorised us to trade with NCSC on EOL so we expect to add another 
counterparty shortly.  Furthermore, we are planning a meeting with Calypso 
fund management and credit to come to a solution to allow the fund to trade 
with EOL

Deal Flow
Given the coal desk rates for Rustock, Mission, Spanish ports, Pier 9 to 
rotterdam  and also have sold to the coal desk a cape from Australia to 
Rotterdam for Feb/March 01 loading

Miscellaneous
Our new operations person is joining us this Monday ( Dorte ) and she joins 
us from Norden.  Norden is a large Danish shipping company where she had been 
working for the last 4 years

Travels
None.

INDONESIAN COFFEE- STRONG BEARISH- FUNDS LACKING FOR RETENTION

The Finance Minister, Prijadi Praptosuhardjo IS saying that the government 
has no
money to finance the retention plan.

According to a source close to AEKI, the government has not contacted the
association at all. Another possible sore point is the interest rates
charged by the banks for coffee retention. So far there has been no
indication that favorable interest rates will be extended to AEKI. Some are
concerned that the rate will be higher than that charged by the private
banks. Due to the tension which exists on these issues, AEKI has threatened
the government that if the money is not chanelled before April they will
release 10,500 tons of coffee in their retained stock from the warehouses in
Lampung and Medan.

There are people who believe that 10,500 tons is "just the tip of the
iceberg." There is more than 7,500 tons in stock in Lampung alone, according
to an important domestic farmer in Lampung,  who is close to our source. In
fact the farmer estimates that Lampung itself has more than 10,000 tons and
there are another 4,000 to 5,000 tons in Medan.

VIETNAM COFFEE- STRONG BEARISH- VIETNAMESE DUMPING "PHANTOM STOCKS" IN 
NEIGHBORING MARKETS

Our primary source comments that in his opinion, it may be true that there
are additional stocks over the 150,000 tons as reported. Cambodia has been
used as a dumping ground for Vietnam's extra quota sales.

Upon investigation, our source learned that it is true that there are some
excess stocks stored in Vietnam. He was informed by a source that the
Vietnamese plan to release the stocks into Cambodia and also China to sponge
up the excess supplies. They command a fixed price in the black markets of
those countries and provide much needed foreign exchange to the Vietnam
government. The secondary source said that this is common practice for
Vietnam and they have done this for other cash commodities like Cashewnuts.
The source does not know the exact figures, but estimates the excess to be
30,000 to 40,000 tons more than what has been acknowledged by the
government.

Mike and Jeff,

The following is an update we sent out to Harvard and Ospraie regarding the 
status of our transaction pipeline.  I thought it would be of interest to 
both of you as well.



Gentlemen,

We have sent the final version of the CA to Hallwood to be signed, hopefully 
we will receive information either tomorrow or early next week and have a 
preliminary valuation and structure proposal by the end of next week.   We 
are negotiating a CA with Nuevo and they appear anxious to get started.  
Their general counsel told me they have prepared a box of due diligence items 
to be delivered as soon as we agree on certain terms.  The DevX CA should be 
finalized today as well and we will get started on that prospect hopefully 
next week also.  We are still waiting on information from Chesapeake, but I 
spoke with Marc Rowland last week and he is getting his new reserve report 
finalized and will send it to us when it ready.  Benton is progressing albeit 
slowly because of the complicated nature of the structure.  We are also 
analyzing a new transaction that another group within Enron has originated 
and structured a VPP around but they may not have favorable financing.  It 
could represent an opportunity for both of you to see if a small equity 
participation in the SPV is of interest.  That's it, call me if you have any 
questions or comments.

Doug,

I just wanted to say that you handled Hallwood perfectly. Also if it is time
to move on other fronts -- Benton / Nuevo -- I am ready to go. I think Nuevo
will probably be under pressure in the next few weeks after missing 4q and
reducing reserves.

JS:
Several analysts have approached me with the desire to join me in EGM. What 
are the limitations on this? Also Dutch quigley is interested in coming over 
as well. He would like to start in research with a view that he would later 
trade or market something in EGM.
Thanks
Jen

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always
recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.
Nat

Subject: Rotation

Jeff,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on the Gas Trading Floor. I 
believe I have learned a great deal not only about the technical aspects of 
the business but also about the less tangible but as important sides of Gas 
Trading such as teamwork, open communication, and freedom of thought. In all 
honesty, the overall environment and rhythm of the floor are the things I 
have enjoyed most and I can now better understand how these elements have 
been successfully applied to new ventures. 
I will be due for rotation in about 2 months and have started to attend 
brownbag lunches hosted by the various ENRON divisions. The one I enjoyed 
most was given by the ENRON Networks' E-Commerce group and its relationship 
with the Houston Technology Center. This group was initially signalled to me 
by an associate friend of mine working there as an ENRON loaned executive who 
is also due for rotation in December.  From what I gathered, the group's goal 
to bring together entrepreneurs, new technologies, and venture capitalists 
could be a good match with my skills and interests.
I recall you mentioning Networks to me as a possible rotation and would be 
very grateful if I could benefit from your feedback and advice on the matter. 
I thank you again for your assistance and hope all is well in Global Markets.

Massimo

		 Subject: multi-trigger option contract

following up on our discussion yesterday; for these types of deals, i dont 
think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty's 
authorization to enter into the agreement.  these are short term transactions 
and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because 
competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements.

the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does 
a derivative deal with an open-ended downside, loses $50 million, and then 
claims that it was not a valid contract.  in our case, they are only 
hedging.  we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known 
up front.  therefore they will not attempt to make this claim.  even if they 
did, our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout.

the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty 
trying to get their premium back.  seems like a 5 second decision to me.

is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single 
long form?  by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these 
requirements because the payout liability is only 1-way.

Subject: gmp update and mtm exposure

in addition to our unsecured debt and strategic stock risk we also have a mtm 
risk on the cargoes
that we have been importing under ectric. the arrangement was that we would 
import the cargoes 
(enron selling to ectric) and allow gmp to buy small volumes from us on an 
intank transfer basis.
this was working ok for the month of november but with their volumes falling 
dramatically in dec 
they have not been buying any material and in addition have given us a 
program for 3 dec cargoes
that at this stage they really didn't need.  that is not 100% correct because 
they did need these
volumes to meet their strategic stock requirements but clearly they are not 
going to be selling these
volumes for sometime if they cannot get some cash to  prepay for the oil.  
this mtm risk is conservatively
around 9 mil dollars.  this mtm risk reflects the fall off in flat price of 
oil over the month of december.  
this is somewhat of a hedge against gmp acknowledgement of the hedges that 
ectric was holding
against the strategic stocks but nonetheless we are in a situation where we 
should import no further
oil.  robert quick and myself are going to spain in the first week of january 
to clarify the veba oil pledges
and potential fraud.  we are getting several vsl on subs for lifting oil out 
of spain in 1h january to show
that unless gmp is seen putting money back into the business we will be 
removing our support from
them.  given the significant risks still present we can only hope that such 
actions on our behalf in ely
jan. will initiate a response from gmp management that hasn't happened 
previously.  i've enclosed
the spreadsheet that reflects the appx mtm risk on the oil ectric is holding 
in spain for the account of
gmp.  I don't believe we could have done this any other way or they would 
have folded already.
any hedging we did on their behalf would have added further to our risk (we 
already had the short
futures vs the strategic stocks) in an upmarket but cleary we need to 
consider this risk when we
evaluate how quickly we are prepared to take the actions that will close down 
gmp.

I was researching something on Eric and noticed that he is assigned to the

Sheriff which I think is incorrect. 

I have asked Kim to leave him on the expat payroll, but pointing 
organizationally to you and McConnell in EGM rather than Sheriff in EEL -- 
correct?

Jeff,
 This weekend while I was at Penn I spent some time with Gary (he interned 
with us last summer) and found out that he has received an offer from JP 
Morgan for Trading.  It is a pretty good offer overall but I still think that 
Enron is a better opportunity and we just need to convince him of that.  I 
was hoping you could take a few minutes out to call him and talk to him about 
it.  I really thought we would be able to have him sign full-time but now 
this throws a little curveball into things.  His home number is 215-386-4251 
and his cell phone number is 215-432-5635.  This is a really bright, great 
guy that I think would end up becoming a major asset to Enron.  If there is 
anything I can do please let me know, but I'm sure hearing from you will make 
a difference.

Sarah

Subject: Enron Gift to Wharton School

Cindy:

I have just received from Jeff Shankman's office under a cover letter dated 
November 9, 2000 a draft of a Gifting Agreement between The Wharton School 
and Enron, outlining a gift of $1,000,000 to Wharton for its eBusiness 
Initiative at the Corporate Partner level. The draft reflects that we would 
pay $250,000 for each of the next 4 years, commencing in December 2000.  My 
understanding is that Jeff Shankman and Jeff Skilling have approved of this 
gift.

Before we finalize this arrangement, are you aware of any 
issues/matters/provisions that Enron typically attempts to deal with in these 
types of gifting arrangements? I just want to make sure that we don't 
overlook anything material. If you would like to see a copy of the draft 
Agreement, I can have it delivered to you.

Your prompt reply is appreciated.Thanks.

Hey - have you made a decision on this product tanker thing?  I returned 
today to three Joe King emails in my inbox.  

Proposed rate structure from Trader Nav is $13,750 year 1 + an additional 
$250/day for each subsequent year.

Rate increase explained as such:  "As anticipated, due to the pressure on the 
yards for the berth availability, prices have increased somewhat, but still 
they are within a range that, in
our opinion, are very competitive when considering the market conditions."

Joe also sent along a Poten&Partners study about the proposed acceleration of 
vessel phase-outs due to the Erika disaster.

If you're still looking at this, I suppose I'm not saying that I don't have 
time to take another look at this, but...

ps. London is nice and rainy today.  I just thought you might like to know 
what you are missing here!

All of your concerns are valid, and I too would like to work through them

		 Subject: discussion

jeff,
when I came to Houston in late December there were, if you recall,  a number 
of issues that
I had hoped to discuss with you.  We only really scratched the surface with 
the reorganisation
announced today.  I would prioritise them as follows:

1) recruiting, training, and keeping talent.  
there is a lack of depth in the organisation.  to make matters worse most of 
the recruiting was
done by greg whalley and now all of those traders are on expiring or expired 
contracts.  the
fact that all of them on the international side received bonuses less than 
last year doesn't 
help.   also the industry is expansion mode so it is harder to recruit and 
keep talent.  we are
running the risk of getting left with the unhireable and losing the best.

2) vision.  
having worked for enron for three years i realise that the company seeks 
self-starters.  one of
the frustrations that I have in Europe, and is a problem with the group 
overall, is that too many of
the employees are on their heels waiting for direction from above.  that is 
one of the things I was
hoping we might address in a reorganisation that shrunk the business units.  
smaller teams would
be more focused on opportunities to grow the business, communicate better, 
and energise the
environment.   still we need as senior management to discuss in a more 
specific sense where we
need to improve the most.  you have identified customer business, eol, and 
research as the three
key areas.  I would like to discuss with you the priority of being able to 
sell physical fuels.  the easiest
thing to do is get long expensive oil and the hardest thing to do is develop 
a system.  this group has
made almost no progress in developing a physical system.  that is what I will 
be working on in the 
heating, diesel, and jet fuel markets.  I would have thought the greatest and 
first opportunity that we
need to be exploiting is fuel supply to utilities.  btu related shorts, that 
leverage upon our existing gas 
contacts, would seem to be our greatest inherent advantage vs our 
competition.  also it could focus
our fuel oil and middle distillate group on the opportunities between gas and 
liquids.  The relationships
have never been closer and this seems to be a situation that could remain for 
a long time.   the u.s. 
presents more opportunites but we are making good progress in developing 
financial hedging
business in europe with continental gas and I'm pushing the origination 
groups in Europe to look
into the physical supply opportunities.

3) systems.
I'm going to spend sometime with Brent Price tomorrow but my conclusion on 
doing the post-mortem
on Spain is that we need to resource the back office significantly before we 
can significantly grow
the business.  They are struggling to keep up at the moment and the process 
seems very bureaucratic
and inefficient.  This worries me because if you look at the problems that we 
have gotten into in the past
we don't seem to have made great progress in eliminating the probability of 
there reoccurance.

now in terms of the situation with myself.  please put yourself in my shoes 
for a minute.  I have had no
life for the last year sorting out the crap of others (q1 - helsinki/q4 - 
spain).  in the middle part of the year
I had to spend much time addressing the people issues and other problems 
created by the vacumn of 
no managment in London for over a year.  Was able to coordinate a good profit 
on the gasoil books that
was pissed away.  In addition, I have had to take back over the book because 
ross was not capable
of managing the short gamma position that was chopping him up.  the point 
being that managing didn't
pay.   I have to run but these I want to discuss.

Subject: ARA Coal Mkt Summary

SUMMARY

The market has definitely come under pressure since the dizzy heights of of a 
fortnight ago where producers were still standing firmly 
behind $33 per metric on a FOB Richards Bay equivalent and claiming it was 
heading swiftly to $35. While there had been some nervous
short covering by utilities in the month prior to coaltrans which had  
fuelled the mkt somewhat the buyers have remained disciplined and
in general have refused to commit to these numbers. The lack of business at 
these numbers has definitely moved the mkt south and of
course mkt psychology with it. While producers are still playing lip service 
to abve numbers they are actively putting up offers which 
reflect levels of $31 FOB Richards Bay and wud trade down to $30.50. Several 
sources have confirmed in the last cuppla days that
negotiations between Kepco and South African producers for price fixing 2001 
tonnage fell apart which ultimately means there will be
an additional 3 million mt which the South Africans have to find a home for - 
destination Europe most likely. On the flip side Kepco will
be looking towards Indonesia and China to substitute this tonnage and this 
combined with rumours that Formosa Plastic will be looking
for some 3 million tonnes of additional material from China cud serve to 
tighten the Pacific mkt over the next months for first half 2001.
There is definitely an intent within the consuming community to make a stand 
against the cartel and there has been a lot of activity over 
last three weeks with business being booked out of the U.S, Indonesia and 
Australia at numbers close to what was achievable from
S.A. into Europe. This can only serve to strengthen our opportunities in this 
mktplace and indeed German utilities who have been held to 
ransom by similar minded producers in Poland are now exploring every end to 
do business with other suppliers - namely ourselves 
in order to avoid being captive to one supplier. Weglekoks incidentally are 
currently in the mkt buying Russian material to cover sales 
made against Polish to Bewag - we don't want to be short Polish in the near 
term!

Mkt now trading at $41.25 Fob barge ARA for Jan/Dec 2001and $42.15 level for 
the Jan/Mar 2001. We still see couple dollars on the
downside although the latest incident (guerrilla attack on rail line last 
week) has Gary Drummond threatening to cut production down
in Colombia by half for first few months of 2001 to make a point to the 
unions. We are still trying to ascertain how much this wud bull 
the mkt short-term but we wud certainly take the opportunity to sell any 
spike.

One pnmx of 1% Sulphur "US coal" $40 CIF Rotterdam to GKE.


BUYING SIDE

Continue discussions with Masefield regarding supplies from Santa Marta for 
2001
Working a proposal with Krutrade which will give us access to some 
significant tonnage of Russian coal for 2001 forward.
Various projects within South Africa all of which emanate from the 
development and success of "Operation Springbok".


EOL Update

Total EOL trades for November stand at 1.95 million mt out of a running total 
of 3.67 million from it's inception. As the figures suggest 
there is increasing activity/liquidity in the market with the arrival of 
several new players in recent weeks - most notably AEP. Increased 
volume in EOL has also been mirrored by an increase in the volume of SECA's 
traded in the OTC market with more and  more utilities
who have upto now remained on the fringes deciding to join the party - RWE 
has been the latest SECA virgin to lose it's cherry closing
a deal with ourselves early last week on Q1 through TFS. We are now offering 
our products in Euros aswell the good old green back
much to the confusion of one or two of our clients! At current pace we shud 
have surpassed all our expectations by passing the 5 mill
mark by the end of the year.

GAMEPLAN 

We are currently long to the tune of 1.5 mil mt but this is essentially all 
through optionality at origin which runs through to 2004.
Strip these out and effectively we are running a short ARA position of some 
1.5 mill mt  weighted pretty evenly across Q2, Q3 and Q4
2001 backed by some implied longs at origin through options and firm tonnage 
out of both Richards Bay and Drummond. We are 
very comfortable with this as we hold enuff bullets at reasonable numbers to 
go after the term Cal 01 business while running a European
short pos'n which shud capture the weakness which we are anticipating in both 
the frt mkts and in the Atlantic coal mkt. Shud the the 
European mkt gain some momentum then we have own some slightly out of the 
money options which we wud utilise to execute any
physical shorts in ARA and to keep mkt capped. 

Best Regards
Jez

Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.  

Jeff

Enron is the major underwriter of a very unique and INNOVATIVE exhibit at the 
Museum of Fine Arts ... Star Wars:  The Magic of Myth.   It will be on 
display from March 11 - June 24, 2001 and we're really excited about it!  We 
know that there are going to be a variety of ways to involve the business 
units, employees and our external customers, and therefore we are asking you 
to participate on a steering committee to make sure that we leverage this to 
Enron's maximum potential.   Your expertise is needed!

Our kick-off meeting will be Monday, October 16th at 3 p.m.  in 4C2.  I will 
explain the exhibit in further detail at that time.  Please let me know if 
you are able to attend.  Cookies will be served ... 

Thanks in advance for your help in what I am certain will be a fantastic 
collaboration between Enron and the Museum of Fine Arts!

A friend of mine, formerly with Bankers Trust, called to see if we are 
interested in hearing a story about a floating LNG facility. He is with 
Merlin Production, a small producer, that thinks there is a large market for 
accessing stranded gas in offshore fields.  If you have an interest let me 
know and I'll arrange a meeting. I owe this guy nothing other that a call 
back so if you have no interest say so. Rick

Subject: Intercontinental Exchange enrollment

In order to manage the enrollment of users onto this system, all users must 
enroll via eRequest.  The approval process will mimic that of EnronOnline.  
The requester will go to our internal security application (eRequest) and 
search on ICE.  They must select the products they want to trade - ICE offers 
gas, power, oil and metals.  This will then generate a message to the 
applicable desk head for approval, and generate the appropriate message to 
security to install the application needed to run the ICE.  Once this is 
approved, Stephanie Sever (x33465) will coordinate getting user ids from the 
ICE.  This normally takes a couple of days.  As soon as we get user ids and 
passwords, we will notify the applicable individual.  

To date, the entities that have signed Participant Agreements are ENA, EPMI 
and ECC.  The cost is $500 per month per user on the ICE.

Please call me if you have any questions.

2000




CERA Alert: December 15, 2000 

Title: Refined Products Line--European Markets 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Refined Products 

Rotterdam Differentials 
* The fall in product prices that started in late October-after a brief surge 
during heightened market tensions over Middle East unrest-continued in 
November. Average differentials for all products over crude fell, with those 
for gasoline falling particularly strongly in line with very weak reported 
demand. FOB ARA barges for premium unleaded gasoline over Dated Brent 
averaged $1.51 per barrel, compared with $5.86 per barrel in October.

* Jet/kerosene barge premiums over Dated Brent slipped by over $2.00 per 
barrel in November from October's average, but because of current market 
sentiment favoring prompt production of heating oil, they remained high at an 
average of $10.98 per barrel. Jet values had enjoyed the largest increase of 
all products during October's Middle East-related price increases; 
consequently jet/kerosene's premium over heating oil narrowed in November 
following an easing of tensions, averaging the month at $2.53 per barrel, 
compared with $3.29 per barrel over heating oil in October. 

* Despite falling by $1.33 per barrel from October's level, average 0.2% 
sulfur gasoil barge values remained very strong in November, averaging $8.45 
per barrel over Dated Brent. High end-user prices for heating oil remain a 
strong deterrent to demand, however; provisional data for German heating oil 
demand in November show a fall of over 10 percent from November 1999 levels 
(to an average of 608,000 barrels per day [bd]).

* Discounts of low sulfur (1.0%) heavy fuel oil to Dated Brent widened again 
in November, averaging $6.74 per barrel. As was discussed last month, much of 
the reason for their improvement in October was because of concerns over the 
availability in Russian exports: toward the end of October and into November, 
however, such concerns subsided, leading to a widening of discounts. High 
sulfur (3.5%) fuel oil discounts widened by $3.26 per barrel to an average of 
$9.61 per barrel to Dated Brent.

Refinery Margins 
* Margins fell back considerably after the very high levels recorded in 
October, but still remained quite strong and reflect the current market 
sentiment of favoring maximum refinery production, especially of middle 
distillates. High jet/kerosene and gasoil/heating oil values kept margins 
buoyant, but falling gasoline premiums and widening heavy fuel oil discounts 
were the major downward influences. 

* Using CERA's illustrative yield patterns, gross margins for 
simple/hydroskimming refineries in the ARA region fell by $2.80 per barrel 
over Dated Brent from October's level, averaging $1.19 per barrel in 
November. The deterioration in heavy fuel oil discounts accounted for half of 
the decline, with the large drop in gasoline values contributing $0.87 per 
barrel to the fall.

* The drop in gasoline premiums was the principal reason for the fall in ARA 
complex/cracking refineries. Using CERA's illustrative yield patterns, gross 
margins averaged $3.30 per barrel in November; this is $2.93 per barrel lower 
than October's average, of which $1.74 is attributable to the poorer gasoline 
premiums, with the remainder of the difference attributable equally to the 
declines in middle distillates and residual fuel oil values. 

European Inventories and Refinery Operations* 

* EU and Norwegian refinery crude intakes rose by a further 168,000 bd in 
November, averaging 12.6 million barrels per day (mbd), again an indication 
of refiners seeking to maximizing runs given the current favorable margins. 
Output data for individual products are not yet available, but the high crude 
runs and middle distillate margins would indicate that November was another 
month of very high jet/kerosene and gasoil production.

* Despite the strong crude runs, primary EU plus Norway crude oil inventories 
did increase in November, ending the month 9 million barrels higher than 
October's level (which was revised downward) at 426.5 million barrels. There 
has been a small but consistent three-month contango in the Brent futures 
market, placing a small premium on forward months' values of crude to the 
current month's, which would help to encourage stockholding. These stocks 
represent about 31 days' forward supply of anticipated total demand in the 
first quarter of next year-less than 2 days' fewer supply compared with 
November levels for the past two years. 

* Primary gasoline inventories fell in November from 154 million barrels to 
150 million barrels, contrary to typical seasonal patterns. This may reflect 
the relatively low levels of gasoline production over the past few months, 
and certainly current gasoline differentials to crude are not encouraging 
high gasoline production levels. Nevertheless, this is a potential cause for 
concern as it may lead to significant market volatility during the first 
quarter of next year. 

* Primary middle distillate inventories, however, are continuing to improve. 
October's total was revised upward slightly to 333 million barrels, and 
November ended at 334 million barrels. In addition to record levels of 
refinery production, exports from Russia are proving to be plentiful, with 
November's total exports from the former Soviet Union averaging 460,000 bd. A 
strong transatlantic arbitrage, however, has been causing most of these 
cargoes to go direct to the United States rather than stay in Europe.

Jeff,

Below is the agenda for the meeting with Wells Fargo. 

I was hoping that you could participate during the introduction periods -- 
i.e. 10:00 am to 10:40 am (or longer if you have any interest) - would it be 
possible for you to follow Wells Fargo's introduction with a brief (15-20min) 
presentation/introduction explaining Enron Corp's and Enron Global Market's 
structure and "strategic vision".
You will see that I have slotted you in this time frame -- obviously, this 
conditional on your acceptance.

Please let me know if you are willing to participate in this way.

Thanks again,
George

decided as far as the GasTech Presentation?  Alhamd called for my revisions 
and I told him they were with your's, but he didn't receive them.  Did you 
want to go forward with any of those slides I suggested?  Otherwise, I'll 
tell Alhamd it was fine.  I'll drop you a voice-mail to the same effect.

Thanks,
Merritt

Jeff -- 

Is there an extra space on 33 for me?    Some of the business folks have 
asked that I move closer to them.

Please let me know what you think.  

Thanks,

Lisa

Dear Jeff,

Happy Valentines Day.  I was in New York this weekend for halley and
Michael's Valentines day brunch.  halley mentioned that she would try to
get in touch with you for me.  I received an email from her yesterday
suggesting that I call you in order to arrange a trip down to Houston to
meet some people at Enron.  However, I do not have your office number
and have not had much luck getting it off  the internet.  I am
requesting, if possible a reply containing a number at which you can be
reached.  I will call you and we can then work out plans for a visit.

Have a great day, Dan

Jeff

Need your input on LNG, particularly email below and requests by VV Rao for 
people in this office to be involved in LNG discussions.
Steve Lowe claims the LNG group have booked $5MM off the back off NWS 4th 
Train.  Steve claims he was instrumental in "introducing"  Enron LNG people 
to the NWS consortium and to BHP wrt the Japan regas proposal.
Would appreciate clarification on operation of the group.

Hi Steve:  It was a pleasure to meet you again in Sydney.  You live in a 
wonderful city. 

The meeting with NWS is now confirmed for Thursday, Jan 11th in Dubai.  I 
will be arriving with my colleague Satish Venkataraman on the morning of the 
10th so we can have a day of preparation.  I suggest you plan on joining us 
so we're all on the same page.  You'll need a visa which takes about 4 days 
to process so I think you need to start on it right away.  My assistant 
Dorice Cheong can help you with this.  Her number is (65) 838 9010.  

I'll call you later this week to discuss the meeting further.

Thanks, vvr

Given year end issues, we really need to be trading close to the vest now.  I 
was a little surprised how big the prompt few months position in crude was 
two days ago, and we need to scale them back.  

I need the component var for those four structural trades we have today.  
thanks.... Jeff

Subject: Performance - Weather Trader

Jeff,
my name is Brando Hayden and I am a trader and second year Associate on the 
Weather Derivatives desk.  Mark Tawney, my supervisor, has made a few 
attempts to set up a meeting for the three of us to discuss a few issues 
involving my performance and status in the group.  I believe that I have 
applied myself over the last seventeen months to produce significant results 
in my book and for the group.   My portfolio is up $6.7M YTD (12/17/00) which 
represents a significant contribution to the group's total revenues this 
year.  The issue here is that despite this significant contribution among 
other contributions to the group my performance has been portrayed in the PRC 
process as sub-standard and worthy of demotion.  I do not believe that this 
is just and would like to get this issue addressed.  As a result I would like 
to set up an appointment to speak with you about this matter.

I have attached a report of my trading performance through 12/17/00 for your 
review.  I have done this only because I know your position as President/COO 
of Global Markets grants you access to this information.

Regards,
Brando



PS: Mark has just passed by to tell me you can meet in January.  However, I 
would still like you to have this message.

I spoke with Tom Piazze at Wharton again this morning, about a reduction in 
the financial commit. from us.  He was not receptive, and in the past, I've 
suggested energy outsourcing for the University, and more recently discussing 
their broadband needs.  Others here have thought about this at Enron (like 
the California University system).  Jeremy Blachman and I are going to run 
with this in a more direct approach and see what happends.  (Tom P.  was open 
to all of this, of course).

FYI,  thanks.   Jeff

We would like to thank you for your time yesterday allowing us to make you
aware of the Buildscape initiative and potential opportunities for Enron,
Dow and Buildscape to partner and develop the web based services for the
residential building industry in NA that would lead to a tremendous market
offering for the users/customers of the web solution as well as the market
access and services that could be made available through this new business
entity.

The potential synergy of the Buildscape market rollout and web based
technology platform with the Enron capabilities and market making
functionality and Dow's position in the Building industry as a major
manufacturer/supplier would be a powerful combination and I would like to
recommend a follow up meeting to discuss the options around strategic
investment interests and alliance after you have had a chance to regroup
after yesterday's meetings. The possibilities exist today for Enron to join
Dow as a major investor/partner in Buildscape.

Rob, you mentioned that you will be visiting the NAHB show this weekend. Dow
and Buildscape are also participating and our VP for Building Products
Business - John Schaw who was on the original conference call will be there
as well and we would like to arrange a meeting between John and yourself. I
will ask his assistant Marcy Putt to try to contact you and see whether a
meeting can be setup possibly for Saturday.

Jeff,  James Mason and I were also pleased to meet with you to discuss
global market opportunities on a broader sense between Enron and Dow and we
will follow with a meeting between yourself and Pedro Reinhard( CFO) in
Midland at the earliest convenience.

I have attached the Buildscape presentation from yesterday for your review
and follow up to complement the documents previously sent.

What is the opportunity to look at Elba Island space in conjunction with the 
Dhabol supply contract?  That is, could we go to our LNG suppliers for India, 
and regotiate that contract and provide space for diverted cargoes if 
necessary.  Jim Hughes is spending his time figuring out what to do with 
Dhabol and any suggestions we have may be helpful.  

Thanks.

I am not sure what the fee is but yes there has already been a firm

too late.  We are turning our presentation into an EOL push for electronic 
trading for LPG and LNG.  

I will run down if we actually have to pay 200 grand as well.  Brochures - 
yes there is a draft floating around but I have told these guys that I do not 
want anything put together specifically for the meeting.  I thought we could

As we continue with the India LNG issues, and grow the fundamentals research 
capabilities, I need a "map of the world" showing all LNG producers, and the 
specs of the product they produce, and all of the receiving terminals (demand 
side) in the world that match up with those specs of the producers.  (In a 
nutshell, what can go where)  Can I get this ASAP?  

Thanks  

Jeff

I don't know why I got a new P&L DPR at 2:30 today showing a change in P&L 
and a big VAR violation--most likely due to shroeder's getting shorter 2186 
contracts of crude and Botchlett's getting shorter 2141 heat contracts.  
Don's Var went up 2.8 million to 9.7 million, and Dave's Var went down only 
687 thousand to 3.1 million.  Where is Dave's var coming from?

We need to be under our Var tonight.  Dave and Don--please take care of 
this.

As we begin our summer recruitment process, it is crucial that we continue to 
be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates.  As you know, Enron has 
committed over $1million during the next four years to University of 
Pennsylvania, and Wharton..  I want to make sure we don't limit ourselves in 
getting the Enron message out at Penn and Wharton by restriciting the number 
of summer employees.  I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for 
the summer.  In fact, I'd like to be as aggressive as possible.  I am 
operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have 
positions, we will offer all of them summer jobs.  I will not accept the 
notion of only 1 summer associate, and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts.

In addition, I'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $200 gift 
certificates is viewed as good one.  I'm not sure that is a good use of 
Enron's dollars, and would like to know what other events we are planning for 
the sell weekends.

Harris/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 
Subject: Selldown of Metgas

The partial sale of Enron India's 100% interest in Metgas is on Cliff 
Baxter's list of corporate assets for sale.  As I expressed in our recent 
telephone conversation,  I view Metgas as a key asset that could be of great 
value to the EGM LNG network.  I believe that Enron should reconsider whether 
or not a Metgas selldown is a wise move at this time for the following 
reasons:  

1.  The Dabhol LNG terminal is ideally located for future LNG arbitrage 
plays, i.e., halfway between middle east and far east LNG suppliers.  
Opportunites for Mideast/Far East swaps or shipping backhauls could generate 
significant value for EGM.

2.  Metgas currently holds exclusive rights to use Dabhol's LNG terminal for 
imports of LNG into India, and it will be at least several years (if ever) 
before a second LNG terminal is built in India.  We should not be giving this 
strategic position away.

3.  The fact that our competitors (e.g., Petronas, BP, BG etc.) want to buy 
in is an indicator that we have something of value.  Even a partial selldown 
(and granting of voting rights) to one of these players could serously 
compromise our optionality and ability to maximize value to Enron. 

4. I suspect that the market value of Metgas at this time (given that there 
is still significant developement risk) is fairly small relative to its 
network value to EGM.


If, in spite of my arguments, a decison is made to sell down Metgas, there 
are two things that we could do to limit the damage:

1.  Prior to the sale, sign an agreement between EGM and Metgas that provides 
EGM with exclusive rights to use the terminal, and

2.  EGM should step into the Metgas/Malaysia LNG contract (i.e., EGM should 
buy from Malaysia and resell to Metgas) to ensure that we maintain maximum 
optionality in this contract.  We could do this in a way that gives us 
control of the contract but passes Metgas risk through EGM and back to 
Malaysia.

I understand that the time fuse for this selldown is very short---immediate 
action is needed if you want a vote on this.

Rick

Attached are the weekly IB reports.  Since I'm in London there will be no 
hard copies this week and hopefully it will be up on the EGM Website this 
afternoon.  If you'd like copies of the full reports themselves, please just 
email me and I'll figure out a way to get them to you.  Everyone have a great 
holiday.

Subject: First Gas Power Corp.

The First Gas Power Corp. (FGPC) liquid fuel supply transaction involves a 
1000 MW (two power blocks of 500 MW each) combined cycle land based power 
plant located on the island of Luzon in the Republic of the Philippines. In 
May, 1997 Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (ECTRI) entered 
into a fuel supply contract with FGPC to start delivering either condensate, 
naphtha or gasoil to the first power block of 500 MW due online in June, 
1999. ECTRI subsequently assigned the fuel contract to Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources Singapore (ECTRS). Fuel deliveries were projected at 40.7 million 
barrels over the following 43 months through December 2002. NPV origination 
of $15.2 million was granted to Enron International (EI) and after 
prudency/credit reserve the book amount given to EI was $11.3 million. ECTRS 
and EI agreed to a "true-up" mechanism that would compensate either party in 
the event of a  mismatch between the actual volumes delivered and the MTM 
volumes. 

Fuel deliveries did not start until April 2000 and have not been at the MTM 
volume of 31,050 barrel per day. To put it in perspective, FGPC should have 
taken delivery on 14.2 million barrels by now and they have only ordered 0.9 
million, a shortfall of 13.3 million barrels. This shortfall, as a result of 
the delayed plant start-up and reduced consumption, has caused the ECTRS 
books to currently have a $6.1 million receivable through the end of August, 
2000. The plant is currently consuming 10,000-12,000 barrels per day, which 
means the receivable will continue to increase until the consumption reaches 
the expected MTM volume. When ECTRS approached EI Asia Pacific for the 
true-up amount we were stonewalled. Following many months of discussion with 
EI about the receivable,  Enron Corp. reorganized EI into global regions, one 
of which was Asia Pacific (APACHI). APACHI said it was not their deal, nor 
had they ever benefited from the deal since the MTM revenue originally went 
to EI and they didn't have money in their budget to return funds to ECTRS, 
regardless of the true-up agreement. Subsequently, Global Fuels meet with 
Rick Buy to discuss this matter. Rick recognized and agreed with our book 
problem, but indicated that Enron Corp. was not prepared to remedy the 
situation. We have been waiting for Corp.'s help ever since. 

 ECTRS did not do anything wrong and yet their books have suffered the 
consequences of a project not living up to it's original estimate. How can 
Enron operating groups grant MTM origination across company lines and not 
expect those regions and projects to live up to the original MTM volumes, 
term and margins granted?

Wade, Bill & Neil,

Attached please find a summary compilation of the various issues and 
discussions that occured on the Dabhol project status update call that was 
presented to the LNG vessel interests.  I initially put this together as a 
way of organizing my notes, as well as communicating the latest status to 
Mark Haedicke and Alan Aronowitz in EWS/EGM Legal, who have asked to be kept 
advised of developments affecting the LNG contracts.  However, in discussions 
during this morning's Dabhol project lawyers' call, the issue was raised 
whether any written record of the discussions would be sent on to the 
shiplenders or the Greenfield sponsors.   I offered to make this summary 
available to the group if it would be of any assistance, my offer was 
promptly accepted, and that's why you see all the "cc" names in the address 
line above.
  
Of course, this summary is derived from my notes and somewhat contemporaneous 
recollections of the call, and as such I'm quite open to any suggested 
revisions to ensure the record is set as straight as possible.

Kind regards,
Dan

Jeff, 

I'll call you later today to talk about Bob Rose at Bank America.  He's been 
trading crude with them for a while, and I believe he's well respected in the 
market.  He might be in the market for a job, but wants to keep a low 
profile.  

If we have a fit for him, he could bring a lot of value to Enron.

Jeff, we talked last week about Ozzie Pagan coming to the FPL meeting.  My 
thoughts are that the deals Ozzie are talking about it are great and could 
very well be a part of what we do with the LNG deal, but I doubt the meeting 
will get to that level of detail.  If we get the LNG deal and a possible gas 
transaction on to FPL's radar screen, then we will have accomplished alot.  
Having Ozzie there as Enron's Florida power project developer may be too 
distracting.  As part of the many follow-up  meetings we will hope to have 
with FPL, Ozzie can make his pitch to them.

If you concur, I'll let Ozzie know.

Thanks

Subject: Further to your report

Jeff:

If further conversations with our technical folks, they have a suggestion 
which I believe increases the flexibility of this report and a key question 
which helps determine the resources required to support it.

First the suggestion.  If the report is designed to run with a Start date and 
End date, you will be able to pick the reporting period.  For example a 
particular week, a calendar month, the latest four weeks, etc.  This would be 
in lieu of the more structured (hard coded) format in my e-mail of 
yesterday.  I recommend this option.

Second the question.  How far back in time do you want to query?   60 days?  
90 days?

There is an extensive data capture requirement to prepare this report.  Each 
product will be queried a minimum of 24 times each day to capture the time, 
bid price, bid volume, offer price, offer volume.  All of this data will need 
to be stored for as long as you want to be able to query.   By limiting the 
amount of time the data is kept, we can minimize the amount of data storage 
resources required to support this report.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

-Bob

Shanna,

I have two personnel that we need to place on contract.

Ted Noble was promoted to manager at year-end.  I need to put him on a one 
year contract.

Eric Scott is an analyst.  You know the story.  I need a one year contract

Jeff,
With this note, I am assuming that you would like to have Sheila go through 
the scheduled Super Saturday for Rice on November 3rd-4th.  This will allow 
several people to meet with her through interviews and she will also be able 
to participate in the Friday night dinner with other Enron Executives.  I 
agree that this is the best solution for Sheila.  If you have any additional 
questions, please let me know.  Thanks so much.

Shelly Jones,
I understand from Shelly Butler that you have already set Sheila up in the 
Rice Super Saturday in November.  Thanks.

Jeff,
Please see the notes below regarding Sheila Chang who was a summer intern 
brought in from the Rice Leadership Program.  Interns that came in through 
this Rice program did not go through the normal campus interviews by the A/A 
Program.  The A/A Program would recommend that Sheila go through a round of 
Super Saturday interviews just like all other Analyst off-cycle candidates.  
This would allow other top Enron people to review Sheila and evaluate her 
skill level.  

With that said, I believe that Jennifer thinks highly of this individual and 
the A/A Program could forgo the interviews it you agree to take Sheila in 
your group for the first rotation.  Please confirm that you would like Sheila 
to be made an offer from the A/A Program and that you will accept her in one 
of the EGM groups upon graduation.  Thanks so much and if you have any 
questions, please let me know.

Below is the information on Sheila as was described in my email this 
morning.  I understand she will have to go through the Super Saturday process 
just as any other Analyst would.  Will you please advise Jennifer on the 
process and when Sheila will be participating?  Thanks so much for assisting 
Jennifer in this effort.

Jennifer,

Shelly Jones is the Recruiting Manager for the Analyst Program and is 
managing the current Super Saturday process.  She can provide more 
information on hiring processes.

Thank you,

Subject: Sheila Chang

Shelly:
 Per our conversation this morning, I have attached Sheila Chang's resume. 
Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of 
the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila's mentor in this 
program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. 
I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to 
Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who 
can think outside the box.

Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was 
instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila 
left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas 
consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid 
grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the 
swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped 
develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila 
demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other 
attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe 
Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates 
in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in 
Global Markets upon her graduation.

If you need any further information, please let me know.

Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Jen Fraser

Jeff,

We are reviewing the P+ spread option book.    One item of note is that the 
correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from 
what was being used a year ago (see charts below).   I also remember that 
John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.  In fact 
he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not 
allow it, so he was using 0.999.

We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.   If 
you want, Vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day.   Just 
let me know what time would be convenient.

Do you have an interest in providing a recommendation letter for my 
application to the analyst program?

During my tenure of one year at Enron, I've assisted Errol and Dutch manage 
Mike Maggi and John
Arnold's positions including xpits/deliveries, etc. to effectively ensure 
that their positions (and risks) have
complete accuracy. As you know, I am responsible for this task for all groups.

Furthermore, I constantly seek new methods of creating value in the natural 
gas (and other) groups.
As you may know, I am working with John Arnold on a project to evaluate our 
existing brokers to utilize their credit lines
properly which are interest-free (most of them) so that we may reduce our 
interest costs associated with initial
margins.

I'd like to meet with you briefly to discuss your thoughts on the MG meeting 
last week and assist you in
any follow-up endeavors.  I'll contact Sheila Glover, if you wish, next week, 
to see if she has received the contact
list which you requested.

Representatives of Wharton's admissions group will be here on Monday, October 
16 for a presentation for prospective graduate
business school students which I will be attending.

Thanks.

Jeff,
The main problem that our customers are identifying is that the products are 
randomly put on EnronOnline.  Unfortunately, this pushes our customers to 
other systems that are consistently showing numbers (such as Altrade's 
Chalkboard).  Here are some comments that Jennifer McQuade and Beth Cowan 
have received over the past two weeks:

NGL products (Jennifer McQuade):
Products that come on and off-line throughout the day (or sometimes are never 
put out all day): Natural Gasoline (physical only), Normal Butane, Purity 
Ethane and Physical Conway Propane (Craig Story).  These products are less 
liquid and the traders (Wade Hicks- physical, Adam Gross-financial) find it 
difficult  to keep the products out all day.  However, Chalkboard (which has 
the LPG on-line market share) consistently has 4-5 postings in each of these 
products.  Companies that have commented on this include Dynegy, Gulfsream 
Trading, Huntsman Petrochemicals, and Taylor Gas Liquids.
Lately, when one of the traders is out of the office, his products are not 
being posted (i.e. 12/14 Wade Hicks was out of the office and there were no 
physical Mt. Belvieu products).   
The product details say these market are open from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm, but 
the products often don't come on until 8/8:30 and are often gone shortly 
after 2:00 pm.

Crude/Products (Beth Cowan):
Beth spoke with Kirk Kinnear at Hess Energy Trading Company LLC (2nd largest 
crude counterparty).  Kirk commented that we are posting various products but 
the hours that they trade are not consistent - he compares EOL to other 
exchanges where the numbers are up all day long.  J
John Brewer at Occidental Energy Marketing said, "we are interested mostly in 
the PT market & West Texas but weren't seeing many quotes out there so I quit 
looking at it."
US WTI Cal swap - should be online until 3:30 central - Rob Fuller
US WTI Index products - should be onine until 3 - Rob Fuller
US WTI Basis Products - should be online until 6 - Rob Fuller

Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls 
that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards 
are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the 
operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic 
measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  
Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored 
on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.

As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations 
to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please 
review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to 
discuss further.

Regards,

Brent

Michelle,

Thanks for the quick turnaround on the draft contract for Dan Reck.  Mark 
Frevert, Mike Mcconnell and I had several conversations today about this 
issue.  I have left a detailed voice mail for Mark outlining the target 
amounts, and will wait to hear back from him (by tomorrow) before presenting 
this to Dan.

Regards,

Jeff

Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there 
were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial 
team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar 
recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 
contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless 
weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we 
are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting 
function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, 
given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, 
we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be 
accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in 
their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all 
responsibility going forward. 

I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.

Jeff

In addition to this business below there is a very good chance that we are 
going to get a short of 1.4 mil bbls per year
of low sulfur fuel oil barges for 2001-2004.  We think this will be a good 
deal for us to get on the books since the bulk of the
hedging interest that the continental gas desk is bringing to us is customers 
looking to buy fuel to hedge natural gas prices. 
Continental gas are anxious to close this deal because the gas contract is 
well in the money and would like to book this
deal for this quarter.  There are var issues that need to be considered 
though so we need to address this at the beginning
of the week.

Thanks

Chris.

Subject: tax structure pre-pays in the north sea

corporate finance in London (primarily Chris Harris) has been looking for 
about 6 months into approaching the small north sea 
producers to do pre-pay purchase contracts that would enable the producers to 
significantly reduce their tax liability to the uk 
government.  These producers (talisman, kerr mcgee, lasmo, hess, enterprise, 
and a couple of others) are
currently paying some 65-70% of the value of crude oil back to the government 
and they feel the cost savings to the producers is 
something on the line of 25% after financing costs for the pre-pay.  I have 
asked them to do a presentation to you, as if you were one
of the producers, for how this structure would work.  Can you advise when you 
would be free for this?  The volumes could be large
(potentially upto 25 million bbls) and there is considerable basis risk in 
hedging these physical volumes.  we are looking into the
price that we could bid them for their physical oil that covers the basis 
risk.  It would be nice to try to combine this with some long-
term gas supply contract on the continent that would require us to be buying 
fuel and gasoil as the hedge and we are approaching
some of the large natural gas buyers in continental europe to see if the 
recent spike in oil prices has encouraged more hedging.
please let me know your thoughts on this and when/if you could be free for a 
presentation from chris harris.  

thanks,

chris.

Larry Gagliardi has been with us for 6 months marketing EOL crude/products 
for 6 months and has signed up well over 50 customers according to Nowlan.  
He came from the crude and products broker TCT and knows the traders in the 
business.  He's our guy, and I want to expand his role in the group, as well.

Thanks for the update.  I think it shows how starved for new products these 
exchanges are.  I'm not a fan of teaming up with these kinds of entities.  
It's unclear what they bring, and how does this help us?  what do you think?

We have had some meetings with the Helsinki Stock Exchange, and they are very 
eager to link to us on Weather.
What's your general opinion about linking EOL to other Exchanges when it 
comes to Weather contracts?

Subject: Weather: meeting with HEX

Meeting with the Helsinki Stock Exchange (HEX) went well and the future 
opportunities for both parties were discussed. They were very eager to list 
HDD swaps (and options at the Exchange) and this should be done by this 
coming spring. 

Below some bullet points from the meeting:

"deadline is spring
Enron as one of the market makers
They would need our help in formulating the product descriptions for the 
local authorities in Finland
They are looking at listing a few points in Finland to start with and then 
maybe adding other Nordic / European points 
They will provide clearing services for the products 
They will also market the products and give training to institutions as well 
as private investors/hedgers


Next steps:

They will contact other players regarding the weather derivatives. However, 
it seems that they see us as "the one" in this market and therefore would 
like us to help them out in the beginning. 

They will get back to us during this month to give us an update and outline 
the future process in more detail.

How do you feel about this? Are we interested in becoming a market maker? 
I feel that it would a great opportunity for us i.e. increased liquidity and 
they would do most of the marketing and training. They are also in a co-op 
with Eurex, which could open more doors for us in the continental market.


--------------
They have also to some extent investigated the possibility to list Real 
Estate derivatives at the Exchange. The way to do this would be to construct 
an index based on the closed deals in the real estate market. There could be 
separate indeces for the different part of the country or just one common 
one. Is this something we could do as well?? It would be a good instrument 
for institutions with large real estate portfolios as well as private 
investors (those saving for a house or the ones owning real estate).

Jennifer,

Could you please co-ordinate with Brenda Johnston (Rick's Houston assistant) 
to help facilitate the move of the LNG group to the Enron Building.  I 
appreciate your help on this issue.  Send me note when you are able to 
confirm timing etc.

Thanks

Jeff/Mike,

I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under 
the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no 
direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related 
supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is 
a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations 
and current discussions with the suppliers.

>From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule 
the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both 
suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron 
as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural 
start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 
2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is 
more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update 
on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to 
discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will  
be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone 
number is 505/336-8400.

ARGENTINA:THE UNPALATABLE CHOICE AMONG DEFLATING, DEFAULTING OR DEVALUING

Executive Summary

could be even more painful
Deflation will remain the strategy of choice so long as De la Rua survives;=

if his government falls, both default
      and devaluation become likely
Mexico and Brazil are in a stronger position to face the fallout from a=20
devaluation than they were in 1998

November 16, 2000

1. Argentina Recession

The question haunting observers of Argentina is whether the De la R?a=20
administration will succeed
in stabilizing the country=01,s economy and pulling it out of its second=20
recession in five years. Indeed,
the 11-month old administration has not lived up to expectations and is=20
quickly losing market
confidence. Although the country has so far maintained the support of the I=
MF=20
and Washington,
the outcome of the unfolding crisis is by no means certain. Argentina is=20
trapped in a fixed
exchange regime that succeeded in taming inflation but is now impairing its=
=20
competitiveness and
long-term prospects.

2. Deflate, Default, or Devalue?

The administration faces a number of unenviable choices as it tries to redu=
ce=20
the difference
between internal and external prices. It can continue with its present cour=
se=20
of action, attempting
to cut its fiscal deficit amid a deepening recession and a growing debt=20
crisis. The adjustment of
relative prices would thus be accomplished through continued deflation. A=
=20
variant of this scenario
would be to renegotiate part of its external debt, in order to reduce the=
=20
increasingly onerous interest
payments, or default on its sovereign bonds. This, however, would destroy t=
he=20
last shred of
confidence, jeopardize Argentina=01,s future access to international capita=
l=20
markets, and ruin the
country=01,s relations with major industrialized countries. Finally, the co=
untry=20
could opt to devalue.
Arguably, the financial and social cost of this action would be high, but t=
he=20
country could recover
relatively quickly, as the cases of Mexico and Brazil suggest.

3. Recession Threatens De la Rua Survival

The outcome will depend on whether the De la R?a administration remains in=
=20
power. The
government is committed to pursuing a deflationary adjustment, hoping that =
it=20
will pay off by next
year, provided that the US dollar weakens and that its access to=20
international markets is
maintained. However, if the deflation is more prolonged and the economic=20
recession becomes
socially and politically untenable, the ruling coalition could disintegrate=
=20
and the president could be
forced to resign. In that case, the new government would probably decide to=
=20
devalue immediately
after taking power.

4. Brazil and Mexico Less Vulnerable to Contagion than in 1998

The Argentine crisis has raised the specter of emerging market financial=20
instability, notably in
Brazil and Mexico. However, these fears may be unfounded given the progress=
=20
made by the latter
countries in improving their fundamentals. Indeed, both Brazil and Mexico n=
ow=20
feature a floating
exchange rate regime and have gone a long way in terms of balancing their=
=20
fiscal accounts. Thus,
in the event of an escalation of Argentina=01,s difficulties, both countrie=
s are=20
well equipped to
overcome temporary financial turmoil.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 41/2000




Highlight
The freight market keeps inching upwards, with a consensus that the freight 
market will have some upward momentum until early next year, when it is 
expected that the steel makers will significantly reduce their raw material 
imports and reduce their freight requirements.  We are still trying to 
conclude our two structured deals with Coeclerici, but have run into problems 
as counterpart is not keen on agreeing our credit terms.  We are meeting with 
Coeclerici during Coaltrans to try and sort out a compromise and will also 
try to get our credit department to be more flexible with our terms as we 
need to adapt our terms to the shipping industry or face the possibility that 
no one will want to transact on our strict terms.  

This week the liquids group launched their tanker route on EOL and asked Andy 
( our EOL freight trader ) to manage it full time.  Within the first two 
days, 400,000 tons had been traded.

We have tendered for a contract covering two years to ship iron ore from 
Basil to Saudi Arabia starting in Jan next year for the account of Hadeed.  
If we were to win the contract, it would fit very well with our short 
position out of Richards Bay as it would allow us to fix a vessel on time 
charter from Europe to Brasil, then go to Saudi arabia to discharge and then 
continue onto Richards bay to load coal.  The net result of having the hadeed 
contract would be to save 15 days ballast sailing which in terms of dollars 
would equate to $250.000 saving per trip

This is a matter of principle. Sheila was an analyst in our group this past 
summer. She clearly outperformed her peers. I  have attempted to have her 
brought onto the AA radar screensince last May .  Several of my atttempts to 
have her involved in the summer program were rebuffed. I think she should get 
an offer on principle, since we extend them to all high-performing summer 
analysts. Fred also agrees with me that she was a great asset. Dan Diamond 
and the rest of the EOL people would also concur.  I have no doubt she will 
sail through Super Saturday.

There are my thoughts on the matter.  I am happy to go along with your 
suggestions. However, for the record, I think the AA program has long way to 
go in its responsiveness and its ability to think outside the box.

Jeff,
Please see the notes below regarding Sheila Chang who was a summer intern 
brought in from the Rice Leadership Program.  Interns that came in through 
this Rice program did not go through the normal campus interviews by the A/A 
Program.  The A/A Program would recommend that Sheila go through a round of 
Super Saturday interviews just like all other Analyst off-cycle candidates.  
This would allow other top Enron people to review Sheila and evaluate her 
skill level.  

With that said, I believe that Jennifer thinks highly of this individual and 
the A/A Program could forgo the interviews it you agree to take Sheila in 
your group for the first rotation.  Please confirm that you would like Sheila 
to be made an offer from the A/A Program and that you will accept her in one 
of the EGM groups upon graduation.  Thanks so much and if you have any 
questions, please let me know.

Below is the information on Sheila as was described in my email this 
morning.  I understand she will have to go through the Super Saturday process 
just as any other Analyst would.  Will you please advise Jennifer on the 
process and when Sheila will be participating?  Thanks so much for assisting

Shelly Jones is the Recruiting Manager for the Analyst Program and is

Shelly:
 Per our conversation this morning, I have attached Sheila Chang's resume. 
Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of 
the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila's mentor in this 
program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. 
I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to 
Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who 
can think outside the box.

Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was 
instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila 
left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas 
consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid 
grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the 
swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped 
develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila 
demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other 
attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe 
Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates 
in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in 
Global Markets upon her graduation.

If you need any further information, please let me know.

Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

I'm not sure I'm going to make it to Phila because of PRC.  I will advise

1.  Brent-Dubai calendar swap differential.  Idea would be to trade this 
differential on a quarterly basis.
2.  WTI-Brent calendar swap differential.  Same timing idea, Nymex v IPE..
3.  WTI-Dated Brent calendar swap differential.  Nymex v Platts Dated Brent.
4.  WTI-Brent  futures differential.  Issue would be settlement dates given 
the time lag between expiry.

Subject: EOL and the brokers

I have been contacted by ICAP and Man regarding different co-ops between EOL 
and the services provided by these brokers. Icap wants Enron to be the market 
maker for the ICAP electronic system (swap-net) , MAN wants to represent EOL 
to the market and act as a principal between Enron and Man customers.

There are benefits and draw-backs using the brokers. I have my views on the 
matter.  

Jeff, what is our policy for EOL regarding working with the brokers?

regards
chris glaas

Could I also ask you for your general opinion on this rotation  and whether

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 46/2000




Highlight

The panamax market has fallen about $1,000 over the last two weeks on basis 
of time charter rates.  For next year, owners have turned on average quite 
bearish and several are calling us directly to offer us their vessels at 
discounted numbers.  Interestingly, cape vessel owners have been watching the 
falling panamax market with trepidation.  Currently, the spread between the 
two sectors is about $13,000.  Over the last three days, time charter rates 
for cape size vessel for 12 months starting in January 2001 have dropped by 
approximately $1200 and brokers attribute the rapid decline to the 
unsustainable spread between the two vessel types.

Of significant interest this week, Bocimar called us to price put options for 
them.  They told us that they wanted some protection for next year but could 
not buy puts or sell swaps in the market place for fear of creating a panic 
selling mode from owners.  We offered them some prices which they told us 
were too expensive but we are still in discussion.  Our problem is that we do 
not want to diminish our short position for next year so in offering put 
options to Bocimar, we also want to keep selling the underlying - and that 
might be challenging as the market is very illiquid and there are not too 
many bids for next year at good selling numbers.

We are currently continuing to build a short position on panamaxes and are 
offering rates to AK Steel from Brazil to US gulf for their iron ore 
contracts and also offering Sidmar ( the Belgian steel mill ) some rates from 
Brazil into Gent.  We might join forces with Coeclerici on several of these 
tenders to mitigate the risk and also to share market information.

last but not least, we are studying the idea of taking a cape new building 
delivery 2003/2004 on time charter for 8 years with ability to extend for 
three additional years and the ability to buy the vessel after year three in 
Japanese yen.  The time charter rate is very attractive when compared to the 
average time charter rate of this size vessel over the last 5 and 10 years.  
Will keep you posted.

Subject: Weekly Stats Outlook

Crude: Stocks have risen during this week over the last five years by an 
average of 7 mbbls, the smallest increase being last year's 3 mbbls. One 
reason the trend is likely to be repeated is that the SPR shipped 2.45 mbbls 
last week, and this should again show up in PADD 3, while the drop in PADD 5 
stocks (led by a sharp drop in imports) which offset the PADD 3 rise last 
week is unlikely to occur a second week. Overall imports remain high, and 
additional October barrels might just have found their way to the US from its 
closer OPEC neghbours. On the other hand, we have the Capline shutdown (due 
to lack of crude) which took place last week, and an increase in refinery 
runs out of turnaround, but I don't believe that will offset the factors 
pointing to a large build in crude stocks. (Consensus forecast up 2.5 mbbls. 
API still lower than the DOE by 2.4 mbbls)

Distillate: After rising steadily since mid July, demand finally turned south 
last week, with a 640 kbd drop. This is the first evidence that borrowed 
demand is now being paid back. A second week of stats would confirm this, but 
the weakening sentiment on cracks lends some support to the theory. The build 
last week occurred despite a strong drop in imports - providing demand stays 
low, higher runs and high distillate yields should see a build, perhaps in 
excess of 1 mbbls. (Consensus forecast up 1 mbbls)

Mogas: Gasoline demand has been sluggish for most of the year, but October 
sales were relatively strong, especially last week, which topped 8.7 mbd (8.9 
in the DOEs), not far off the year's highs. October deliveries are invariably 
higher than both Sep and Nov, so the most likely direction for demand is 
down. Imports from Canada and Europe are said to be on the way, but may take 
some time before they show up in the stats - although some improvement should 
be seen after last week's miserly 212 kbd which accounted for much of the 
draw. However, the gasoline tanker stuck in NYH may skew the stats. PADD 1 
again bore the lion's share of last week's draw, bringing stocks down to 
their lowest level since at least 1976 - it has lost 7 mbbls in four weeks. 
For RFG too, the region is looking short. This week is hard to call, but may 
point to a build, on the basis that strong demand and weak imports aren't 
sustained. (Consensus forecast down 1.5 mbbls. API still higher than DOE by 
2.6 mbbls.)

The reason for the memo before was because the India guys still don't

Boy did I unpack last night.  I couldn't go to sleep so I went a little 
crazy.  Tuesday is good.  we could have a frasier marathon.  Which one of us 
is cooking at my house?  

Would it be crazy if I asked you to be my guest at the wholesale christmas 
party next sat?  (Nothing like email to ask that sort of question, and I 
certainly don't mean to be impersonal about it)

I have to head home to work out for a few hours....

with you.  I am so happy that we have gotten to know eachother.  Having guy 
friends is something that I have missed out on for the past two and a half 
years.  I am really happy to have that back in my life.  

My meeting at the crack of dawn went well this morning.  I got here before

 As Heather and I  finish defining each group's needs, we were wondering if 
the Office of the Chairman needs any data, analysis or publications on a

Gentleman,

We are currently planning a three day trip in early March to provide you with 
the opportunity to visit the coal properties in our portfolio and meet the 
principals.  These include the following:


DPR Holding Company  Chris Cline  Beckley W. Va.
The American Coal Company Bob Murray  Galatia, Ill.
BMR Resources  Richard Gilliam  Benham, Ky.

We plan to use the corporate jet in order to facilitate transportation to 
these garden spots. You will have the option of touring all three operations 
or limiting your visits to a specific mine/principal. Each visit will include 
an underground mine tour.

Bill Giuliani will be coordinating the visits for Enron and will be 
contacting your assistant  this week. Please let us know of your availability 
and particular areas of interest.

Mike

Subject: A meeting to discuss progression of markets




Jeff:

As Brian may have told you, I am now based in London.  I remain responsible 
for
all BNP Paribas commodity brokerage.

I am writing to inquire if Enron would be interested in comparing and 
discussing
its experience in commodity exchanges, electronic markets and related matters.
As you know, the exchange (IPE/NYMEX) business is on the verge of electronic
transformation, your views on this and associated issues would be invaluable 
to
us.  I have two objectives in mind for such a discussion.  Firstly, I wish to
insure that BNP Paribas continue to provide Enron with a useful service.
Secondly, perhaps there is potential of commercial collaboration in this area.
Please let me know if you would be interested in a meeting.


with best regards,

The 2000-2001 crop is currently being exported, and exports from the crop=

that this crop will be bigger than expected and total 32-33 million bags. =
=20
Brazil=01,s Ministry of Agriculture (Embrapa) is expected to release an off=

government forecast called for 28.9 million bags.  Growers have been issuin=
g=20
similarly lower crop yield estimates for 2000-2001 as a way of calling=20
attention to a probable bad harvest and pressuring the government to provid=
e=20
more generous financing subsidies.

The current dry weather impacts the 2001-2002 crop, not the 2000-2001 crop,=
=20
which is largely harvested.  Crop receipts issued by cooperatives in Brazil=

are 11 percent greater than they were in 1999-2000.   Our top source in=20
London believes that the 2000-2001 crop has been largely discounted by the=

market and that the focus should be on 2001-2002.

2. 2001-2002 Crop

This is the crop that should be currently flowering in Brazil, but was=20

e=20
2001-2002 crop will run from April 2001 to November 2001 and will be export=

in the second half of 2001 and in the first half of 2002.  The Brazilian=20
government is likely to release its 2001-2002 forecast in December or Janua=

2001.  The 1999 plantings garnered expectations of a 2001-2002 crop yield o=
f=20
44-46 million bags.  However, recent weather problems have caused a=20
significant downgrade of this forecast to between 33 and 40 million bags.

Other sources in contact with coffee growers in Brazil report the potential=
=20
for even greater damage to the 2001-2002 crop, in the range of up to a 50=
=20
percent drop, or 22-23 million bags.  Agronomists from Cooxupe, the largest=
=20
coffee cooperative in Brazil, have already pegged their first estimate at=
=20
27.8 million bags.  Again, however, it is critical to remember that growers=
=20
tend to exaggerate weather damage, which is then further exacerbated by=20
market rumors.  As evidence, dry weather in the spring (Sept-Dec in Brazil)=

of 1999 caused alarm regarding the 2000-2001 crop.  Even though the dry=20
weather did not end until December 1999, there was still time for flowering=

which caused many market watchers to upgrade their forecasts.

While analysts and growers agree that the highly irregular status of the=20
coffee trees makes the 2001/2002 crop one of the most difficult to evaluate=
,=20
the occurrence of average to normal rainfall will greatly sharpen crop=20
forecasting efforts.  It is most critical for the rest of November and=20
December.  Recent rains since the last week of October have begun to addres=
s=20
the hydrological deficit in the soil.  Continued, steady, well-dispersed=20
rains will help offset losses, but estimated irreversible damage to the=20
expected yield of 44-46 million bags from frost and dry weather to date wil=
l=20
be a minimum of 15 percent, making the new yield forecast no greater than=
=20
38-40 million bags.  A shortage of significant rainfall between now and the=

end of December could bring yield down to a 30 percent loss from the=20
forecast, in the range of 33-36 million bags.

Rain is particularly significant because the new planting in recent years h=

coffee can be mechanically harvested in this region, but requires significa=
nt=20
irrigation.  The irrigation alone will only partially offset the dry=20
weather. =20

The frost damage from June 2000 accounts for a 75 percent crop loss in Para=
na=20
and a 20 percent crop loss in Sao Paulo, but these states only account for =

percent of total Brazilian production.  In Minas Gerais (almost 60 percent =

production), the crop losses are only 10 percent.  Crop losses in Espiritu=

Our sources will monitor rainfall and flowering/cherry formation on the=20

Jeff,
I'm the researcher who works with Ted Bland and has been surfacing 
Associate/Analyst type resumes for you and Lavorato (the binders we gave you 
guys).  Attached is the resume of a personal friend of mine, Robert Brown 
(Bobby), who may be a good fit for your group.  He is a '97 University of 
Pennsylvania graduate (3.1 GPA) with a degree in Economics and an 
International Finance concentration.  Additionally, he holds Series 7, 63, 65 
licenses.  

Bobby had expressed an interest in Enron to me some time ago, but didn't want 
to pursue anything at the time as he was going to be traveling for quite a 
while.  He contacted me last week, ready to explore opportunities at Enron.  
Upon reading his resume, I felt it is very much in line with many of the 
other resumes I'd surfaced for you and Lavorato to you last month (given to 
you by Ted Bland).  He's very bright, ambitious and I feel would fit very 
well into the Enron environment.

Let me know what you think and don't hesitate to call if you have any 
questions!
Amy

Subject: Morgan Stanley Power Desk

Jeff,

It is my understanding that you will be speaking with Simon Greenshields at 
Morgan Stanley ("MS") tomorrow.  I have outlined the facts as I know them in 
regards to our position with PG&E.

Enron Energy Marketing Corporation ("EEMC") has four outstanding purchases 
from PG&E Energy Trading - Power LP ("PG&E").  One of these transactions PG&E 
has backed with a purchase from MS.  We have not been disclosed exact terms 
of the transaction PG&E has with MS.  The terms of our transaction with PG&E 
are as follows:

EEMC purchases 100MW around the clock 1/1/2001 to 12/31/2002 from PG&E with 
delivery point of SP15 at price of $29/Mwh

This transaction is currently in-the-money $130mm.

We are proposing to assign EEMC's position to EPMI and then EPMI would agree 
to take assignment from PG&E its position with MS in return for unwinding 
EPMI's transaction with PG&E.  Our net book value would remain unchanged but 
we would transfer credit exposure to MS rather than PG&E.

It is my understanding that MS is currently posting margin to PG&E above some 
threshold within the Master contract between PG&E and MS.  With the 
assignment EPMI would assume the contract under its Master agreement.  The 
current agreement has no executed margining agreements but we have been 
exchanging margin above a $15mm bilateral threshold.  Enron would be willing 
to either not require collateral on the deal or take the collateral under the 
current terms negotiated but not yet documented.

If we choose to take collateral, MS can post either cash or letters of 
credit.  If they post cash, EPMI contractually can invest those funds as we 
see fit but will be required to pay interest at the Fed Funds interest rate.

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Bill

I am looking forward to it as well.  Don't worry...I am not planning on 
spending too much time on our sob stories!  Tuesday, November 7 is the best 
for me.  If that doesn't work, Thursday may work, but on the later side.  I 
think I have to have a drink with a consultant coming into town, but I am not 
sure.  

Have a safe trip and I can't wait to hear all about it.  If you decide that 
Australia is to amazing to leave, I will completely understand and we can 
reschedule.  I wouldn't blame you a bit!  In fact, we could have drinks 
there....I've never been!

All,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike

I believe Mr. Shrivastava has been working as Assistant Manager with Enron 
since May 10, 1998.  If this is correct, we will be able to bring him into

Can you please let me have an email address for him so that I can send him

Dear Member of CAM Board of Trustees,

You may recall that several weeks ago we surveyed the Board members to 
determine preferences regarding Board meeting times. We did this because we 
have had several discussions with members who have great difficulty with the 
4 pm or 4:30 pm meeting time.

Since the Board appears to be fairly evenly split between a noon meeting time 
and a late afternoon meeting time (10 definitely prefer Noon; 10 definitely 
prefer late afternoon; and 20 have no strong preference), we have decided to 
try alternating the meetings.

Therefore, our next full board meeting, which is currently scheduled for 
Monday, January 22 at 4 pm, will instead take place Monday, January 22 at 
NOON (March meeting will take place at 4 pm).

Please note this change on your calendar and advise Cheryl Blissitte by 
email, phone (713.284.8253) or fax (713.284.8275), whether or not you will be 
attending. This is especially important as we will order sandwiches for this 
Noon meeting.

Thanks.

Marti

Thanks for your interest.  Of course I remember our conversation.  By now I'm 
sure you know you are on our interview list.  (If I told you prematurely, use 
it to your advantage somehow with your friends.)  I've contacted one of our

It's a great idea, and you should hear back from me shortly, when David

Best regards,

Dear Mr. Shankman,
? How are you doing? We met last week at the  undergraduate Enron 
presentation and discussed the possibility of an Enron/ESPN  deal that would 
enable television viewers to order old sporting events over the  television 
(similar to the Blockbuster deal). You told me to send you an email  around 
this time to follow up, so I can find out who to contact to get the ball  
rolling. Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my idea.
?
Sincerely,

I reached Greg today and had a nice conversation. He encouraged me to call 
you.  

Having missed you today I wanted to make a few suggestions. 
With regard to your reservations about an investment in plant and equipment- 
I understand that any such investment would be: limited and subject to your 
being very attracted to the deal. I am confident that I can bring you deals 
that will sell themselves. 
-need to have an exit strategy that would allow an exit within 2-4years 


A trading strategy without investment in plant and equipment will yield 
attractive results. 

With regard to how that would look - I will draft a short business plan and 
send it to you next week basing it on a pure trading basis.  

Let me invite you and Greg to a breakfast (or any other meal) during the week 
of 16 Jan. That will give me a chance to get a few numbers in your hand 
prior.

Subject: Enron Global Markets - transaction approval process


I am an Enron Europe lawyer dealing with Enron Global Markets business out of 
London. In Enron Europe we use what is known as a CACS form for approval of 
non-standard deals. I attach a copy of the current form together with an 
email from Mark Evans, General Counsel for Enron Europe. 

I wonder whether for EGM business you wd want to modify the CACS form; for 
example, under the standard European CACS if the deal involves a commitment 
of  GBP 3 million or more, either Michael Brown or John Sherriff needs to 
sign. It may be more appropriate for EGM deals for either of you to sign 
(unless you are happy to allow the European Office of the Chairman to sign) 
with a different (possibly USD denominated) threshold.

I would be grateful for your thoughts

Robert

Subject: CACS FORM: IMPORTANT INFORMATION


The CACS form is becoming an ever more significant tool, not only to manage 
legal risk within Enron Europe, but also to enable our middle office 
departments to capture new transactions promptly and ensure adequate 
transactional information flow.
 
With this in mind, the CACS form has had further minor changes made to it and 
is to be found at: 

S:\legal\CACS form. 

Please ensure you use the form at this location at all times henceforth. Do 
not save it into your own directories, as further changes will be put through 
on this form only in future. No changes are to be made to this form please 
(in particular to the named signatories) without my agreement.

Please read the notes on the second page of the CACS form and then adhere to 
the process set out there. This is particularly important because many of the 
commercial teams are not reading these and then appear to be getting 
differing explanations of the process from us. Some of the support units in 
particular are unhappy that A1 is not being complied with, leaving them with 
inadequate time to review contracts. 

I am always happy to improve the form, especially if it simplifies, so 
suggestions are welcome.

Two things which will happen are: 

- adapted forms of the CACS will be produced for EES, Enron Global Markets 
and (until divested) Enron Wind. In the meantime if lawyers working on 
transactions within those divisions believe the proforma CACS needs to be 
changed to accomodate the needs of those divisions, please let me know. Mary 
Nell: I believe that EBS already has its own independent contract sign off 
process. Let me know if that is not correct.

- the CACS system will be automated - probably on the workflow system as per 
the new billing system. The idea is that at the earliest opportunity in the 
life of a contract, the CACS relating to that contract is put on the system 
which automatically alerts signatories that they should be looking out for 
drafts. Draft contracts will be able to be circulated through the system. The 
signing process will also be simplified.

Thanks for your attention.



        Mark

JAna and Charlene that his first rotation will be with us. He also expressed 
an interest in ending up in crude and products but did want to see other 
parts of Enron. Told him to do a good job and it would not be a problem.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 06/2001




Highlight

Cape market is bouncing back after having fallen for the best part of two 
months.  The bounce is expected to be gentle and not long lasting.  Owners 
are raising their rates for March cargoes as there appears to be a few more 
cargoes around mostly attributed to the fact that Japanese steel mills expect 
coal and Iron Ore prices for this year to increase and are therefore 
maximising their current contracts.  Furthermore, Bunkers have risen sharply 
over the last 10 days to over $130 in Rotterdam which was not expected by the 
market.  Of interest, Bocimar is redelivering ships it had taken on short 
period last year back to the head owner earlier than their contract allows 
for which has a few owners thinking about suing Bocimar for damages.  

The panamax atlantic market has been falling hard over the last week with 
little grain movement from the US gulf and fresh Japanese concerns of GM 
crops imports from the US.  However, the Plate season is expected to start in 
March and market anticipates a return to healthy rates then.   The pacific is 
also falling from incredibly strong rates seen three weeks ago before the 
Chinese new year.

On the long term time charter with Mitsui, Mitsui has officially lifted their 
board of approval subjects and we are working through the internal 
documentation/proper sign off at this stage.  

We have offered some competitive freight rates to the US steel group to 
import steel slabs from Turkey to US in the hope of providing the freight for 
this business when it happens.  Pierre is meeting with the pulp and paper 
guys while in Houston at the end of Feb and also going through NYC to meet up 
with the Enron metals shipping guy to discuss joint efforts in shipping to 
maximise synergy's and cost savings.  Furthermore, we are currently 
discussing with the US weather group the possibility of offering protection 
to ship owners for days lost at seas due to severe weather.

by over 1,000 trades a day since October.  There are now approximately 3,100 
trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.

*  The newly combined East Region in North American Gas has approximately 
doubled its average daily EOL deal count and average daily EOL volume since 
October.

*  The newly combined Central Region in North American Gas has increased its 
average daily EOL deal count about 38% since October, from 498 to 685 deals 
per day.   However, the average daily EOL volume has remained steady since

has remained steady since October.

*  Southeast Power has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by over 51% 
since October.  The average daily EOL volume for Southeast Power has 
decreased significantly as well.  However, these are approximately the levels 
we had seen in prior months before October. 

*  UK Power has more than doubled its average daily EOL deal count since 
October from 8 deals to over 15 deals.  The average daily EOL volume has  
remained fairly level.

*  Nordic Power has increased its average daily EOL deal count about 45% 
since October, from 20 to 29 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily 
EOL volume has increased about 25% since October.

*  US Weather has steadily decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a 
high in June of 241 deals to recent low of only 25 deals.  However, there has 
been a slight increase in November to 31 EOL US Weather deals with one more 
day to go..  

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen by approximately 85% since 
October, from a daily average of 150 to a daily average of 280 for November.

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November stands now at only about 21% of 
the total in October with only one more day to go.

The US/UK Arbitrage book, the Finland Arbitrage book, and the Products 
Arbitrage book in Singapore have been shut down, and no positions are 
authorized to go into those books going forward.  In addition, all positions 
in those books must be pulled out as of today, and I want them removed from 
the P&L reports I get.

Also, we need to set up a separate book for the 24 hour, 4 cent wide EOL 
crude market.  

Thanks.

Jeff,

Let me know what you think of this guy.  Wade Cline and Tim Det. are both 
high on him.  Jeff Donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on Friday.  
During my lunch with Jeff, we discussed that we need a Corp. Dev guy 
dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him, that would be great.  I 
think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get 
a part time guy in the process.  He could also report to us obviously (like 
Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a  lot of sense.  What do 
you think?

If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp 
Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.  I thought he was all 
right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an 
innovative thinker.  He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't 
seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always
recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.
Nat

Subject: Re: DPC/Metgas Equity Sale  

Clay, we've been banging this drum so long in India that we've broken all our 
drumsticks. We've always maintained that access to the Metgas terminal and 
storage and pipeline is key to any plans Enron has in the LNG business. 
Personally, I have always thought Enron should just finance and build the 
pipeline itself and then sell it once it becomes operational, maintaining 
access to the terminal and pipeline capacity. Glad to see you're on board, 
because we can use the help. 

But this is going to require some Enron commitment. To meet Enron's 
objectives (no debt consolidation, cash flow and earnings), the current 
selldowns being considered are to industry and related players who want their 
share of the upsides of the business. So giving Enron any preferred rights is 
going to be tough with these players.

Let's discuss next week in India. I have requested the Metgas meetings with 
the EGM LNG team be on Wednesday.

Subject: DPC/Metgas Equity Sale

One of the keys to growing the LNG business is access to LNG terminals and 
fuel supply opportunities. We should insure that the sell down of DPC and 
Metgas be structured such that Enron/EGM retain terminal rights and fuel 
supply rights at Dabhol, if appropriate. The Metgas terminal/regas rights 
under the TARA and EFI's fuel management/fuel supply rights under the Fuel 
Management Agreement need to stay with Enron/EGM. Lets discuss next week in 
Mumbai.

Clay

Dear Naomi,

Thanks for the opportunity to work with you on my new home.  I've enclosed a 
virtual tour disk (just follow the prompts), and some floor plans from my 
architect.  If there is anything else you need, please call anytime.  I'm 
excited for you to see the house in person, and have the chance to discover 
my passion for 20th century design.  Dennis and Daniel have been a great 
source of the best objects and knowledge.  Of course it is a primary concern 
to make sure the home, the objects, the furnishings, and the space work 
together.

Dennis and Daniel speak very highly of you and it is important to me that I 
have the help to complete this project with great attention, and all that 
results from that attention.

Best Regards,



Jeff

Author: Mark Seetin <nymex2@unidial.com>

I'm forwarding a communication sent at the direction of NYMEX regarding
the CEA legislation.  This truly is an unbelievable process.

Mark Seetin


NYMEX Chairman Dan Rappaport has asked me to convey, on behalf of the
Board of Directors, our strong opposition to the passage of H.R. 4541
with the current energy exemption provision.

This provision is anti-competitive, anti-consumer and is bad for the
marketplace.  If the proponents of this provision were truly in favor of
competition, at the very least, they would not have opposed extending
the same regulatory treatment to open outcry markets.  Their opposition
to such regulatory equity speaks volume about what may be the true
intent--use government and legislation in a perverse way to thwart
competition and allow them a government sanctioned license to hijack a
market, without even having to compete for it.

Please do not allow this bill to go forward without a closer examination
and discussion of this unwise provision.

If you have any questions, Chairman Rappaport may be reached at (212)
299-2250, My telephone number is (202) 662-8770.

Would you please update us on the status of your discussion on behalf of
Senator Gramm, and the overall status of the bill?

Chris,

I was in a meeting today with Jeff Shankman and he was interested in who in 
the NYMEX was behind their efforts in DC to cause EOL problems. I told him 
the Enron DC office was pleased with the initial federal government comments 
regarding protection for EOL from the NYMEX's stance. He still wanted to know 
who at the NYMEX was causing Enron grief. You may respond directly to him if 
you wish, but please let me know that you have responded to Jeff so I can 
consider my request closed. 

Thanks,
Doug

Your thoughts are dead on.  Russel would be a great guy to cover those guys 
for EGM for crude and products.  Please mention to Caroline we are not trying 
to crowd her out, just get more depth on funds coverage.  Also, when we talk 
about other GRM products, it will help to have more fund coverage.  (We can 
also address her issue later--I agree with you on that.)  Proceed, but I'm 
not sure about the JV with ENA issue.  Let's not go down that road 
"officially".

By the way, rough is spelled roof.

Later.....

Jeff

		 Subject: My call this morning was re Hedge Fund Coverage for GM

I know you're busy so here are my thoughts.

The hedge fund business has expanded enough to warrant at least two people 
covering it. It makes sense that Enron has one person focussed on the natgas 
business since it is 90% of what we book right now. We're also about to get 
one of the funds trading power.  Caroline Abramo focusses on this and will 
continue to do so reporting to Fred. If for some reason that relationship 
doesn't work out, we can revisit it with her at that time.

To build up the crude oil and products trading we should have a similar 
person devoted to covering the hedge funds. That person should work for GM 
and work in partnership with ENA, kind of a JV between our groups, but with 
the origination for each product staying with the appropriate business unit, 
as you plan to do.  Given that, I would recommend putting Russell Dyk in that 
role, have him spend the next 2 months working on the crude desk to kick 
start the coverage and then move him to NY. He and Caroline would share the 
hedge fund client base and back each other up when busy or travelling. If we 
need more support, we can add an associate to work for them jointly in NY. 
Overall, we're leveraging our hedge fund relationships to generate more 
origination income for Enron.

This model also fits with the reality of hedge fund coverage at Enron, i.e. 
you need marketers with specific product knowledge close to the trading desks 
dealing direct with the fund traders. Enron Metals has their own people doing 
this today. We're simply expanding the concept to GM. Ultimately, when we get 
Enron under one rough in NY, the metals, oil and gas specialists woukld be 
able to jointly cover the clients, while providing market expertise as needed.

If you agree this makes sense, then I can tell Fred that we plan to put our 
own person in NY.

What do you think? I can stop by to discuss further any time today.

Subject: lng shipping

jeff
long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

Mark, Thor, and Todd,

Thanks for the video conference this morning.  Mike and I are convinced 
weather can and will be an extremely profitable business.  One issue I would 
like to address is EnergyDesk.com.  It seems like an interesting idea, but 
I'd like to find out more about it, and in relation to the work Tom Gros in 
doing in NetWorks.  I'd also like to understand more about the scalability of 
this model, and our relationship with Kiodex.  

To that end, I do not want any proprietary data, product interface, and or 
other weather related matter and material to be part of EnergyDesk.com.  I 
will keep you updated as I learn more about these and other issues.  

Regards

Jeff

Jeff,
To ensure that the business units are involved in the recruiting of top 
quality candidates I am requesting your assistance in the Super Saturday that 
is scheduled for either Saturday, November 4th, November 11th or December 
9th.  We would like for you to participate as follows:

Be the speaker at breakfast
Interview candidates 
Facilitate the decision making meeting

The breakfast is from 7:30 AM until 8:30 AM.  The speech would begin at 
approximately 8:00 AM and need not be more than 15 to 20 minutes.  You would 
interview approximately 4-6 candidates.  A vital part of the process is 
determining which candidates will receive offers to join the Program.  We 
would like for you to facilitate the decision making meeting.  The meeting 
will be held in 5C2 beginning at 1:30 PM. and conclude by 3:30 PM.  We will 
provide the administrative assistance.
Your assistance and input would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know 
as soon as possible of your availability.
Thanks in advance.

By the way thanks for the help you have provided with Penn at both the 
graduate and undergraduate level.  It is very much appreciated.

Charlene

Subject: mkt thoughs

we ran out of time in the meeting....my thoughts fwiw

short-term this market is going to continue to be sideways and choppy.  
weather fundamentals don't exist and nothing else will be fundamentally
bullish or bearish enough to lead the market for the next several weeks.

 Most people (including the majority of our shop) are getting bearish on the 
back of the builds we should have based upon iea supply/demand predictions.  
One concern here is that they have materialized yet over q3.  If we look at 
the poor reaction to bullish news last week
(api stats/unrest in the middle east) I think it is safe to say that the 
sentiment in the market has turned bearish.  
In general I want to go with the majority of the mkt but the rally that 
resulted when the violence erupted in the middle east two weeks ago shows
the surprises will still be on the upside.   the way that we gave back all 
that ground reflects how little confidence there is in the mkt at the moment
that these fundamentals last too much longer.  How many reports have you read 
lately about borrowed heating oil demand?  my back of the
evelope calculations suggest that although this is somewhat true it only true 
for 150kbd in the winter vs an underlying demand of 4000kbd so
maybe not such a big disappointment to come.

we still like being bullish distillate in europe for the winter but think 
that the mkt will be range bound on spreads and vs the complex until the need
for winter coats comes along.

Attached is a new paper by James T. "Jim" Jensen of Jensen Associates,
Inc., entitled "Oil-to-Gas Price Competition - Can it Place a Cap on Gas
Prices?".  The paper is very thoughtful and timely.  Because of the
immediacy of the issue, we have elected to distribute this article by
e-mail and to post it on the USAEE website (www.usaee.org) rather than wait
to publish it in the next issue of "Dialogue".

We are grateful to Jim for providing this excellent article.  If you have

Yes, there is a formalized process.  After Credit and Legal, and in most

to sign the Bahamas option contract, I need to know the premium.  Please 
contact Brent Price for our DASH.  (Deal approval sheet)

Jeff,

I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I can't seem to get a straight answer 
from anyone - when one is signing a contract around here, is there a form you 
fill out for approval?  In London, everyone fills out a CACS form (Contract A
uthorisation Control Sheet), and if the deal is > $0.5m, then a DASH is 
required as well.  Brad seems to think that if a DASH is not required, then 
the business unit head signs off on the expenditure?  Is there a formalised 
global-markets process for this, or is this a product-by-product thing?  (in 
which case, I'll assume LNG has no process, and I'll direct Eric to implement 
one...)  (Doug Arnell needs to purchase his option for the Bahamas land 
thing, thus the reason for the question).

fyi, attached is European CACS form. 

Thanks,
Merritt

Jeff,
Please see the notes below regarding Sheila Chang who was a summer intern 
brought in from the Rice Leadership Program.  Interns that came in through 
this Rice program did not go through the normal campus interviews by the A/A 
Program.  The A/A Program would recommend that Sheila go through a round of 
Super Saturday interviews just like all other Analyst off-cycle candidates.  
This would allow other top Enron people to review Sheila and evaluate her 
skill level.  

With that said, I believe that Jennifer thinks highly of this individual and 
the A/A Program could forgo the interviews it you agree to take Sheila in 
your group for the first rotation.  Please confirm that you would like Sheila 
to be made an offer from the A/A Program and that you will accept her in one 
of the EGM groups upon graduation.  Thanks so much and if you have any 
questions, please let me know.

I believe that Sheila should receive an offer now. She was one of the most

just any other top intern would have received one.
Thanks

Shelly,

Below is the information on Sheila as was described in my email this 
morning.  I understand she will have to go through the Super Saturday process 
just as any other Analyst would.  Will you please advise Jennifer on the 
process and when Sheila will be participating?  Thanks so much for assisting 
Jennifer in this effort.

Jennifer,

Shelly Jones is the Recruiting Manager for the Analyst Program and is 
managing the current Super Saturday process.  She can provide more 
information on hiring processes.

Thank you,
Shelly

Subject: Sheila Chang

Shelly:
 Per our conversation this morning, I have attached Sheila Chang's resume. 
Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of 
the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila's mentor in this 
program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. 
I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to 
Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who 
can think outside the box.

Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was 
instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila 
left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas 
consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid 
grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the 
swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped 
develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila 
demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other 
attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe 
Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates 
in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in 
Global Markets upon her graduation.

If you need any further information, please let me know.

Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Jen Fraser

Janet,

I wanted to drop you a quick note.  Things have been progressing nicely 
between the LNG guys and Southern Company.  The LNG guys asked me if ENA 
needed to get some MTM from Elba, they would be willing to quicken the pace 
on putting a deal together.  Probably rushing is not in the best interest of 
Enron buy it could be done.  Anyhow, I have legal and structuring working on 
this and we may need you to help negotiate a transfer price between ENA and 
Enron Global at some point.

I think no matter what happens prospectvely at Elba, Southern Co has probably 
saved the LNG group up to $50MM of capital clean up their off spec gas along 
with provided a much better price of Hub +$.12 vs our current put option of 
Hub + $.02 with El Paso which is an additional $36.5 MM improvement.  Let me 
know what you thoughtsare.

Thanks.

There ae meetings scheduled in Singapore starting early next week to disclose 
key information to potential buyers of Metgas, including BP and presumably 
other competitors.  Disclosures will include the terms of the Metgas Malaysia 
Sales contract and will quickly get into our concept for EGM to sign a master 
supply agreement with Metgas.

Have you talked with Baxter/Sanjay about this?  I still believe that selldown 
of Metgas is a mistake that will cost Enron dearly down the road.

My view on the discussions with Southern Co. is that it is one of several 
potential ways to get at some upside out of our rights at Elba Island.  It's 
also giving us a good indication of where the market is for gas sourced from 
LNG coming in to Elba.  Nothing will be committed to without considering all 
the alternatives at Elba and a full review within EGM and asumably ENA.  The 
discussions are still, in my view, exploratory.

I thought he was in the running for the President position, after Pat died.  
He phoned me today--did he indicate to you in what he is interested?

Jeff, Greg and John,

Our old friend Tom Costantino is interested in coming back
to Enron. It seems that his move to NYMEX either will not happen
or will not happen for some time.

You can contact him at home:

Of course I want to get together next (this?) weekend.  In fact, the house 
should be almost done, and I'd love to show it to you, too.  I'm pretty open 
also, but am doing super saturday again, and am not sure what my deal is 
friday evening (if anything, and will know by tomorrow).  

Last night on A&E was a special about Palm Beach, and the good life, charity 
balls, social scene, etc.  So I had a Palm Beach Party--bought caviar, fruit 
tarts, champagne and sat around watching the show.  I made everyone wear 
Lacoste shirts, loafters (no socks) and not put down their glass full of 
champagne (as much as possible!)  Fun, casual, and last minute.  For not 
being in your biz, I liked the idea and we had fun.   

Went to my first exec committee meeting.  Pretty interesting.  But can't wait 
to hear about your parties for Vicki and Dan....

Merritt,

Call me to hear the latest about the Northwest Shelf deal.  V V  left me a 
message saying that he would still let us "work on the pricing, structuring 
side", but that he's been kicking his bid around with Wayne, Clay and Rick 
and they're going to put together their own idea.  Gee, are you getting the 
impression that they don't get it?  They seem to want to go long on 
Australian cargoes by bidding at a price that would only make economic sense 
if it goes into India.  They're not going to go through us to get there.  
They didn't comprehend that to take a long position means that you are 
putting that position in a book.  I'm going to lose it.

Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting:  have 
you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in 
particular).  We have been very successful in helping customers save quite a 
bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and gas 
markets, that can be extremely valuable...

Our analysts were covered during the summer, weren't they?  Why not use 
whomever was used then.  I thought you were going to change the A/A review 
process from mid year, since that was a disaster by most accounts.

Do you know to whom you submitted your PRC Reps?  I don't believe that any 
one in the Associate and Analyst Program has received that information.  We 
will be using the same format as mid-year and we are looking for 1 Director 
for the Analyst PRC and 1 VP for the Associate PRC from your EGM groups.  
Each would represent approximately 15 individuals.  Do you think you could 
forward me a copy of your submitted list so we can move forward?  I would 
greatly appreciate it. 

Just to let you know, I did forward an email to Shanna Funkhouser and Brent 
Price (on Oct. 3rd and 4th) to make sure that all Analysts and Associates in 
an EGM group go through a pre-rate meeting prior to the final A/A PRC which 
has been scheduled for December 12th and 13th.  We must have the pre-ratings 
loaded into the PEP system prior to these dates and hope they can be final by 
November 30th.  These results are imperative to a successful 
cross-calibration in the final PRC meeting.  We already have dates set for 
the EES and ESA meetings.  I will be glad to attend the Associate and Analyst 
piece of EGM's PRC meetings to assist in facilitation.  Please advise when 
the EGM pre-rating meeting is scheduled.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Jeff,
I am following up on the voicemail I left you on Thursday October 5th, 
requesting a recommendation for a Director and Vice President to represent 
Analyst and Associates in the final 2000 PRC.  Due to promotions and 
additions to the Associate and Analyst Programs, we have an additional slot 
for both the Associate PRC and Analyst PRC that we would like to fill with an 
EGM participant.  This will keep the distribution throughout the business 
units equitable.  

We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the 
PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.  Please forward your 
choice for Global Markets representation to me by this date or contact me to 
discuss.  Thanks so much for your continued support.

Marti asked me to poll the Board to see if there is a strong preference for 
meeting at a different time of the day than we have previously been meeting. 
Board meetings would still have to be scheduled for Mondays, since the Museum 
is closed to the public on that day, but could you indicate below if you 
would like to keep the meeting at 4 pm or possibly change it to Noon:

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for Noon

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for 4 pm

The results of the poll will be discussed at the November 20 meeting (still 
scheduled for 4 pm in Cullen).

Jeff:

As I am sure you are aware, we are facing some significant challenges with 
the Dabhol project.  The government is making noise about reviewing the 
project and our customer is facing significant financial stress.  The plant 
runs on LNG that is indexed to JCC, effectively giving our customer a 
significant crude oil exposure.  As we consider a workout proposal, one thing 
that I have considered is the possibility of embedding some crude oil 
protection into the workout structure.  I would greatly appreciate it if I 
could borrow a few minutes of your time to (i) get a sense of where we see 
forward pricing right now and (ii) share with you our thoughts on the workout.

Subject: Traders Roundtable

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in EB3321.


Jeff & Gary

Subject: Analysis of Supreme Court decision


A friend sent me the following Q&A - it sums up the legal issues very
clearly.

--------------

Q: I'm not a lawyer and I don't understand the recent Supreme Court decision
in Bush v. Gore. Can you explain it to me?

A: Sure. I'm a lawyer. I read it. It says Bush wins, even if Gore got the
most votes.

Q: But wait a second. The US Supreme Court has to give a reason, right?

A: Right.

Q: So Bush wins because hand-counts are illegal?

A: Oh no. Six of the justices (two-thirds majority) believed the hand-counts
were legal and should be done.

Q: Oh. So the justices did not believe that the hand-counts would find any
legal ballots?

A. Nope. The five conservative justices clearly held (and all nine justices
agreed) "that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate
number of ballots which are not punched in a clean, complete way by the
voter." So there are legal votes that should be counted but can't be.

Q: Oh. Does this have something to do with states' rights? Don't
conservatives love that?

A: Generally yes. These five justices have held that the federal government
has no business telling a sovereign state university it can't steal trade
secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law. Nor does the
federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns
in schools. Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause
to force states to take measures to stop violence against women.

Q: Is there an exception in this case?

A: Yes, the Gore exception. States have no rights to have their own state
elections when it can result in Gore being elected President. This decision
is limited to only this situation.

Q: C'mon. The Supremes didn't really say that. You're exaggerating.

A: Nope. They held "Our consideration is limited to the present
circumstances, or the problem of equal protection in election processes
generally presents many complexities."

Q: What complexities?

A: They don't say.

Q: I'll bet I know the reason. I heard Jim Baker say this. The votes can't
be counted because the Florida Supreme Court "changed the rules of the
election after it was held." Right?

A. Dead wrong. The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme
Court did not change the rules of the election. But the US Supreme Court
found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong.

Q: Huh?

A: The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote
is "clear intent of the voter." The Florida Court was condemned for not
adopting a clearer standard.

Q: I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislature's
law after the election.

A: Right.

Q: So what's the problem?

A: They should have. The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court
should have "adopt[ed] adequate statewide standards for determining what is
a legal vote"

Q: I thought only the Legislature could "adopt" new law.

A: Right.

Q: So if the Court had adopted new standards, I thought it would have been
overturned.

A: Right. You're catching on.

Q: If the Court had adopted new standards, it would have been overturned for
changing the rules. And if it didn't, it's overturned for not changing the
rules. That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did, legal
votes could never be counted.

A: Right. Next question.

Q: Wait, wait. I thought the problem was "equal protection," that some
counties counted votes differently from others. Isn't that a problem?

A: It sure is. Across the nation, we vote in a hodgepodge of systems. Some,
like the optical-scanners in largely Republican-leaning counties record
99.7% of the votes. Some, like the punchcard systems in largely
Democratic-leaning counties record only 97% of the votes. So approximately
3% of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can.

Q: Aha! That's a severe equal-protection problem!!!

A: No it's not. The Supreme Court wasn't worried about the 3% of Democratic
ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida. That "complexity" was not a
problem.

Q: Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more
than 20,000 Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan.

A: Nope. The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his
highest, best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with
Holocaust survivors, who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler.

Q: Yikes. So what was the serious equal protection problem?

A: The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the 3% of Democrats
(largely African-American) disenfranchised. The problem is that somewhat
less than .005% of the ballots may have been determined under slightly
different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their
best to accomplish the legislative mandate of "clear intent of the voter"
may have a slightly opinion about the voter's intent.

Q: Hmmm. OK, so if those votes are thrown out, you can still count the votes
where everyone agrees the voter's intent is clear?

A: Nope.

Q: Why not?

A: No time.

Q: No time to count legal votes where everyone, even Republicans, agree the
intent is clear? Why not?

A: Because December 12 was yesterday.

Q: Is December 12 a deadline for counting votes?

A: No. January 6 is the deadline. In 1960, Hawaii's votes weren't counted
until January 4.

Q: So why is December 12 important?

A: December 12 is a deadline by which Congress can't challenge the results.

Q: What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court?

A: Nothing.

Q: But I thought ---

A: The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its
work by December 12 to make things easier for Congress. The United States
Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the
Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding.

Q: But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes
counted by December 12.

A: They would have made it, but the five conservative justices stopped the
recount last Saturday.

Q: Why?

A: Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal.

Q: So why not separate the votes into piles, indentations for Gore, hanging
chads for Bush, votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the
other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won?
Then, if some ballots (say, indentations) have to be thrown out, the
American people will know right away who won Florida.

A. Great idea! The US Supreme Court rejected it. They held that such counts
would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gore's winning
would cause "public acceptance" and that would "cast[] a cloud" over Bush's
"legitimacy" that would harm "democratic stability."

Q: In other words, if America knows the truth that Gore won, they won't
accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gore's victory?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that a legal reason to stop recounts? or a political one?

A: Let's just say in all of American history and all of American law, this
reason has no basis in law. But that doesn't stop the five conservatives
from creating new law out of thin air.

Q: Aren't these conservative justices against judicial activism?

A: Yes, when liberal judges are perceived to have done it.

Q: Well, if the December 12 deadline is not binding, why not count the
votes?

A: The US Supreme Court, after admitting the December 12 deadline is not
binding, set December 12 as a binding deadline at 10 p.m. on December 12.

Q: Didn't the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for
arbitrarily setting a deadline?

A: Yes.

Q: But, but --

A: Not to worry. The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets
for other courts.

Q: So who caused Florida to miss the December 12 deadline?

A: The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount, the
rent-a-mob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating
officials, and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount

Q: So who is punished for this behavior?

A: Gore, of course.

Q: Tell me this: Florida's laws are unconstitutional?

A: Yes

Q: And the laws of 50 states that allow votes to be cast or counted
differently are unconstitutional?

A: Yes. And 33 states have the "clear intent of the voter" standard that the
US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida

Q: Then why aren't the results of 33 states thrown out?

A: Um. Because---um---..the Supreme Court doesn't say---

Q: But if Florida's certification includes counts expressly declared by the
US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, we don't know who really won the
election there, right?

A: Right. Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won
Florida by about 20,000 votes (excluding the butterfly ballot errors)

Q: So, what do we do, have a re-vote? throw out the entire state? count
under a single uniform standard?

A: No. We just don't count the votes that favor Gore.

Q: That's completely bizarre! That sounds like rank political favoritism!
Did the justices have any financial interest in the case?

A: Scalia's two sons are both lawyers working for Bush. Thomas's wife is
collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush
administration.

Q: Why didn't they recuse themselves?

A: If either had recused himself, the vote would be 4-4, and the Florida
Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed.

Q: I can't believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way.

A: Read the opinions for yourself:
http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/supremecourt/00-949_dec12.pdf (December 9
stay stopping the recount)
http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/00pdf/00-949.pdf (December 12
opinion)

Q: So what are the consequences of this?

A: The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our
Constitution (Al Gore) will lose to America's second choice who won the all
important 5-4 Supreme Court vote.

Q: I thought in a democracy, the guy with the most votes wins.

A: True, in a democracy. But America is not a democracy. In America in 2000,
the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins.

Q: So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President?

A: He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure
that the will of the people is less and less respected. Soon lawless
justices may constitute 6-3 or even 7-2 on the court.

Q: Is there any way to stop this?

A: YES. No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate. It
takes 60 votes to break a filibuster. If only 41 of the 50 Democratic
Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not
approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be
democratically elected in 2004, the judicial reign of terror can end....and
one day we can hope to return to the rule of law.

Q: What do I do now?

A: Email this to everyone you know, and write or call your senator,
reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes (three
times Kennedy's margin over Nixon) and that you believe that VOTERS rather
than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote.
And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people, you
want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until 2004 when a president is finally
chosen by most of the American people.

Good afternoon Jeff,

Cindy Olson referred me to you, suggesting that you would have the 
information mentioned below.  Enron University Affairs, Ken Lay, Jeff 
Skilling, Andy Fastow and Gene Humphrey have been working with Harvard 
Business School, specifically Chris Bartlett and Meg Wozny of Harvard, on a 
case study of Enron.  This study is in its last phase and the only 
'roadblock' is gathering additional information.  In particular, Harvard 
would like information on the 'size and growth of the risk management group'. 
 

This information will help facilitate drawing an effective comparison of the 
'old' Enron and the 'new' Enron.  

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,

Cindy Derecskey

Subject: Potential fit for your group

Jeff,
I'm the researcher who works with Ted Bland and has been surfacing 
Associate/Analyst type resumes for you and Lavorato (the binders we gave you 
guys).  Attached is the resume of a personal friend of mine, Robert Brown 
(Bobby), who may be a good fit for your group.  He is a '97 University of 
Pennsylvania graduate (3.1 GPA) with a degree in Economics and an 
International Finance concentration.  Additionally, he holds Series 7, 63, 65 
licenses.  

Bobby had expressed an interest in Enron to me some time ago, but didn't want 
to pursue anything at the time as he was going to be traveling for quite a 
while.  He contacted me last week, ready to explore opportunities at Enron.  
Upon reading his resume, I felt it is very much in line with many of the 
other resumes I'd surfaced for you and Lavorato to you last month (given to 
you by Ted Bland).  He's very bright, ambitious and I feel would fit very 
well into the Enron environment.

Let me know what you think and don't hesitate to call if you have any 
questions!
Amy

I'm not happy today.  Going back to last night, I got home, fell asleep on 
the couch in the new house, went upstairs at 4, and slept til 830.  Late all 
day, and just had a pretty crappy meeting with one of my direct reports and 
Jeff Skilling.  I can't describe the weight of the world feeling I have, and 
I'm not good at not being in control.  I wish I had the answers.

How are you?

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 43/2000




Highlight
The cape market continues to rise almost daily with RBCT to Rotterdam at 
$11.40 and Quennsland to Rotterdam at $15.5 in the spot market.  The driving 
factor has not been coal as of late, but an unexpected rush of Iron Ore 
cargoes.  On the panamax front, rates have been easing for the last few 
weeks, as the expected strong grain activity in the US gulf as not yet 
materialised.  The average time charter rate on capes is now in excess of 
$25,000 daily and close to $11,000 on panamaxes.  The general view in the 
market is that prices for both capes and panamaxes will remain strong though 
to April/May 2001 by which time steel mills will have reduced raw material 
imports and adversely affected cape rates and the shear number of 
newbuildings on the panamax front will drag earnings down as well.  Our group 
tends to believe that the balance of the year will see yet firmer rates but 
we expect a slow down and a decrease in rates to take effect towards the 
first two months of next year as we already are seeing some owners 
desperately seeking to cover themselves for next year at very aggressive 
numbers ( Hadeed contract ) and we are getting the feeling that Bocimar is 
keenly interested to cover their long position even tough their length is 
mainly through March/April next year.  Furthernore, the asian owners seem 
more and more agressive with rates for next year as their countries are 
hitting some rough patches currently, as evidenced by their stock markets and 
strong comments against continued strong crude oil prices.

On the ABC front, it appears as if Zodiac and P&O have agreed in principal to 
a deal by which Zodiac buys 50% of ABC but gets full control of the company.  
Details are still patchy and we are keeping a close eye on the possibility of 
Zodiac putting their newly acquired vessels into the Bocimar pool as that 
would have a drastic bullish effect on rates for some months to come.  We 
have proposed to Bocimar a 5 year collar deal by which we get access to 5 
million tons of freight each year with ability to settle the collar deal 
against an index and have the ability to call upon physical tonnage each 
year.  Furthermore, we would have ability to have a washout clause for each 
year by which we would pay a fix lump sum cash amount.   We have also built 
in several other options and we are waiting for an answer from Bocimar 
sometime next week.  This deal would offer us access to modern vessels at a 
price similar to that of the cape index of the last 10 years and with enough 
built in options to take advantage of any sudden market changes.

On the logistics front, Coeclerici is coming in next week to make a 
presentation on their port handling operations in India/ Indonesia and 
Venezuela with the idea of teaming up with us on forthcoming tenders where we 
would offer the long term coal contracts into or out of certain ports, as the 
case maybe, and they would build and manage the port operations.  They 
currently have some interesting contracts in Indonesian ports which should 
have special interest to us vis a vis CLP.  

Our two cape deals with Coeclerici are still not finalised as we are still 
having a few issues with credit language but expect the deals to close within 
the next 10 days.

On the EOL front, Andy James has been able to get EDFtrading to trade 225,000 
tons of freight via EOL this week and he has added Louis Dreyfus grain and 
Billiton and RWE trading to the list of customers that have trading authority 
on our system.

Regarding the lighter side of business, Enron dry bulk shipping was featured 
in tradewinds, a weekly shipping  newspaper, with 3 pages dedicated to our 
rapid growth and clever insights.

Jeff -

Jean and the boys will be heading to my parents for X-Mas on 12/17.  I am in
Houston until the morning of the 21st, and would love to get together for 
dinner
sometime during that interval.

Are you scheduled to be in town during that period?  If so give me a call at
713.653.8207 (day) or at home at 713.522.9381.  I'll also be happy fill you in
on what happened at the MFAH subcomittee meeting today as well.

Subject: Dabhol

Jeff/Mike,

I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under 
the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no 
direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related 
supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is 
a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations 
and current discussions with the suppliers.

>From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule 
the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both 
suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron 
as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural 
start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 
2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is 
more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update 
on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to 
discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will  
be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone 
number is 505/336-8400.

Please print following on letterhead:

Larry Kellner
Chief Financial Officer
(put rest here)

Dear Larry,

Thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday.  
Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add 
even more value as we explore your basis risks.  I've asked Mark Tawney, 
Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly 
linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities.  
His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge 
research.  

We didn't have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but 
I'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate 
relationship.  If there is anything else I can do, please call. 

It's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier.  
Again thanks for your time.

Regards,

Emergency calls are great.  Used it, but dinner was quick.  So the kids 
singing wasn't as good as barbara streisand's singing prayer songs?  I'm sure 
it was fun, though.  

Jeff is the king.  Already left him a message.  
I'm out dec 19-28, so do you want to try to do something this weekend--FUN.

Did you use the emergency call?  I almost called you on your cell phone in

the singing I got the stuff an Neiman's that I needed.  I had a freak out 
attack though b/c I thought I lost the Saks bag with the $600 bracelet in it 
and was running around Neiman's like an idiot.  Then I remembered that I 
DROVE from Saks to Neiman's and it was in my car.  I think I was just a 
little bit on edge last night!  I met my friend at Barnaby's for dinner and 
then got under the covers and finished my book.  It was great.  By the way, I 
wish I dragged you to the singing b/c Sarah, the 10 month old cutest baby on 
the planet was there.  She was clapping and singing along the whole time 
which was the cutest thing especially b/c she was on my lap the entire time.  
It was worth sitting through a horrible rendition of every Hanukkah song you

FYI

Today EnronCredit completed a deal for Cargill.  Cargill sold to us a 1yr 
Bankruptcy Swap on Farmland credit .
Two months ago, European Freight traders completed financial freight trades 
with grain cargos originating in 
the states for EU and Japanese destinations (Cargill, Dreyfus).  Over the 
past two months, MG Structured Finance 
(NY) has been working on an export finance deal with ConAgra for grains of 
South American origin (US destination 
presumably).  Continuing client discussions continue to surface more than a 
passing interest for weather products 
in the softs (and other agricultural markets from previous discussions).

Guys - We need representation at a senior level from your groups.  Please get 
your Directors and VP's to "volunteer" to help the AA Program out with 
interviewers.  For example, the November 4 Super Saturday has only 13 Manager 
and above level interviewers and there are 38 candidates from UT alone.  
These candidates will become our next crop of AA's.  We control that with the 
Super Saturday process.  Be represented - have your people sign up now 
on-line (see below).  Thanks.  Ted

I saw you called on the cell this a.m.  Sorry I missed you.  (I was in the 
shower).  I have had a shitty week--I suspect my silence (not only to you, 
but others) after our phone call is a result of the week.  I'm seeing Glen at

Ok, Sarah Wesner is not attending and Beth has to come so I've got little 
choice.  I can cut off one more but everyone said no at first and then just 
came back and said yes.  Initially I was going to have to speak so it was 
going to be 4 people and then you can go to speak so that makes 5.  Beth 
included is 6.

Subject: EURO

The French are pushing for the $10B conversion because they view it as a 
"free intervention."  If the Iraqis converted the account all at once, it 
would be 2X bigger than the September G7 intervention.  Not clear yet if they 
will do a conversion of the account, or if they will just do oil contracts 
going forward in euros.

Subject: PLEASE READ- EURO

We continue to monitor the oil/Euro on two fronts.  With respect to Iraq, the 
US has dropped its opposition to allowing Baghdad to receive its oil revenues 
from the UN oil-for-food program in euros rather than dollars.  This means 
that the estimated 10 billion $US in Iraq's BNP account could be converted to 
euros in the next 30 days, perhaps all at once.  We are looking into the 
exact timing and process for this conversion.

Per our report on Wednesday about Welteke lobbying the Saudis to convert 
their oil trading to euros, we await further information  We will keep you 
posted as new information comes in.

I'm not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal (I 
presume you mean under Pierre).  However, we have to look at our internal and 
external options.  If you look at the structure of  the exmar vessell it is 
certainly far from ideal for enron.  In fact it appears to be quite 
one-sided.  First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine 
what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including 
Pierre and Wayne).  Second estabish internal procedure, and trading 
capabilities.  Third, execute.  I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique 
animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I'd like to get everyone 
together to discuss the most appropriate way forward.

Thanks.  Jeff

Further to my voicemail yesterday, I understand through Eric that 
consideration is being given to collapsing the LNG shipping responsibilities 
into the coal group.  I believe that this would be a mistake.  Eric and I 
have been talking about this for some time and have defined and are 
implementing an organizational plan that we both believe is a good one.  I 
would like the opportunity to talk this through with you before you make any 
irreversible decisions.

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  It is obvious that the organizations and product 
lines can lever each other and the synergies will provide powerful results in 
our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

Rocky Emery, Paine Webber, Inc., $5,000 in 2000

Please let me know how to proceed this year.  Are these contacts still good

Thank you very much for assistance.  I look forward to hearing from you very

Yes, absolutely.  There is a ton of work in Japan, and as you know Joe Hirl 
runs the office, but the products in EGM are crucial to its success.  I'd be 
happy to meet her.  Let me know how I can help.

I think he has a strong resume.  He's definitely worth putting on the 
interview list.

As for Japan opportunities, is there a way to get Tess Dyar plugged into 
those?  She just started (from Wharton) after spending nearly 10 years at 
Goldman in Japan.  She definitely has an interest in continuing her work with 
the country.  I think she's been a little disappointed since getting here and 
seeing APACHI dissolved.

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Christopher Handte

What do you think of this:

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering most of 
the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross 
commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and 
promote aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in room 3321.

Subject: Wharton Super Saturday Invites

Wharton interviews were a huge success - we interviewed approximately 48 
students in the first round of interviews, 28 students in the second round 
and invited 19 back to Super Saturday on Dec. 2.  A list of the students that 
we invited is in Kristin's email below.  I think that we've got a great group 
of candidates.  A huge thank you to all of the interviewers - Jayshree Desai, 
Tom Dutta, Bill Keeney, John King, Catherine Clark, Ranabir Dutt, Jeff 
Golden, Chuck Ward, Rajesh Chettiar, Natalie Halich and  Colin Jackson. It 
you haven't already done so, it would be great if you could sign up to either 
attend a dinner or interview for the Dec. 2 Super Saturday.  To sign up, go 
to the analyst/associate web site at http://axis.enron.com/aaxis.asp.

Upcoming Events
Nov. 30 & Dec. 1 - Entrepreneurship Conference.  Tom Gros will be speaking on 
a panel on Corporate Intrapreurship.  Laura Howenstine is leading this 
conference, if you are interested in attending call Laura at 30308.

Dec. 7  & 8 - Finance Conference - Jeff Shankman and a to be named person 
will be speaking on panels.  There is also a career fair associated with the 
conference.  We need 2-3 more people who can attend and man the booth at the 
career fair.  If you are interested in going, please let me know.

According to sources, funds are being told this morning that OPEC is likely 
to cut production by 800,000 - 1 million b/d in Q1 2001, no later than the 
end of February.  Most likely scenario as of now is that OPEC will hold an 
extraordinary meeting in February to make the decision.  In the unlikely 
event that prices continue to slide significantly, the decision might be 
moved up to the January 17 meeting.

Guys

There has been tremendous interest expressed already by generators, 
developers, and utilities to just about every coal producer about locating 
plants at mines. Some are moving forward. The most advanced appear to be 
Peabody (into TVA in western KY) EnviroPower (permitting three sites in Ky 
and Indiana) and Anker (permitting a site in W.Va). All sites are near 
transmission.

We can help locating sites , reserves and producers near transmission if we 
knew where the power needs are.

Absolutely OK to send me a resume on any good person.  Also thanks for the 
update on the new car.  My dilemma is that I need a bigger car to carry 
anything, as you know the porsche isn't the most conducive car for such 
activity.  I'll probably be in before early 2002, as such.  
Best regards,

Jeff,
I trust all is well with you at the office. 

New Range Rover - I want to relay that I am privately informed Ford wish to 
accelerate
the U.S launch of the new car. The UK launch is Sept. this year so reasonably 
may mean arrival here early 2002. Believing this to be accurate, this may 
relieve you of making any decision on Range Rover right now.

Given your continuous search for "good people" and assuming your firm remains 
on the look-out for such people, I wish your permission to submit a resume of 
a colleague.
This lady has excellent work-ethics, is an outstanding achiever with high 
energy and I believe, the suited attributes for the culture within Enron. 
I would hope this could be reviewed and sent onward to the relevant people 
who would invite her for an initial meeting in the near future. Please advise 
this is okay.
Alan

Shankman/HOU/ECT)
Subject: Re: PADD V-California Gas Injection  

Anthony,

 Here is what I can add:

1. Looks like the Conventional Steam Boilers used by producers in the field 
(average boiler: 50 Million Btu/hr, uses 1400 mmbtu/day of gas) that have 
been shut-in, use approx.. 100,000- 150,000 mmbtu/day of gas  (mainly, 
Texaco, Chevron, and independents).  This number can vary depending on which 
majors have firm transport on the pipelines and don't have to pay spot SOCAL 
Border prices.  This steam generation is used in either Steam Floods or 
Cyclic Steam Operations.
2. Crude production has probably not been affected, but if the injections 
stay down, you could see production start to fall off in 3 or 4 months.  
Crude prices in California are very weak right now (Kern River diffs are 
$10-13 under WTI when they normal run in the $5.80/$6.10 area).  Majors that 
have downstream facilities have outlets for their crude and probably have no 
plans to cut production.  Independents are seeing weakness on the buying side 
for the West Coast Independents and majors that normally buy their crude.  It 
might be 2-3 months before things clean up a bit out there on the crude side.
3. Gas injection-  The question here is due producers decide to risk the 
integrity of their reservoir's by reducing pressure and not injecting the 
gas.  This probably would only be done for a month or two.  Noone wants to 
damage any of their wells.  This volume is not well known, but in the overall 
picture really shouldn't affect prices that significantly.  Usually this gas 
is pretty sour and does not command a high price.  This would also be the 
cheapest source or gas for producers to use (if they bought any make-up gas 
for their process).
4. Referring to the question #2, the majority of EOR methods used in 
California are Steam Floods and Cyclic Steam Processes.  The oil is very 
heavy and needs HEAT in order to recover it out of the ground.  Just 
injecting gas would not accomplish this.  There are a lot of CO-GEN units 
that generate steam for most of the Majors and these are not being shut-in or 
slowed down.  Only sustain high gas prices for 6 months would probably start 
affecting Crude production.  Let's remember that in 1998-9 crude prices were 
extremely low and normal gas prices didn't change what most producers did, 
because if they shut-in too many wells, the production would never come back.

If you have anymore questions, please let me know.   Thanks

Mark

Subject: PADD V-California Gas Injection

Hello, John.

Again, thanks for your cooperation.

Summary:
A West gas trader received news from Seneca Resources stating that California 
crude producers that use natural gas injection (or gas lifting?) for 
secondary and tertiary recovery methods may stop injection and - instead - 
sell the gas into the market to benefit from the record high natgas prices.  
That being so, one wonders how much natural gas will be put back into the 
market and how California crude yields will be affected.  

Here are some specific questions that may help us:
How often is natural gas used in California to enhance crude production 
(including gas injection/lifting, steam injection, and hot water injection)?  
Is this really a significant issue?
What is the law concerning onshore gas injection?  If the gas was bought (not 
produced) by the crude producer, is the crude producer obligated to recover 
the injected gas?  If yes, must 100% of the gas be proven to be recoverable?
On average, how much natgas volume is injected in an oil field to recover 
production?
What is an approximate number of producing oil fields in California and/or 
PADD 5
What is the average size of these crude reservoirs?
How many of these fields use natgas for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) - 
reiterating question #1?
Is there a unit estimate of approximately how many MMBtus/Mcfs of natgas is 
needed to produce 1 barrel of crude onshore?
How would stopping gas injection/lifting affect crude supply in California? 
Would crude wells be shut-in?  If so, how would that affect future efforts to 
produce from them?
Will a significant amount of crude be held from the market - especially in 
the PADD 5/Western region?
What commodities are substitutes for natgas in secondary/tertiary EOR and how 
liquid are they in the West?  How feasible, expeditious, and economical is it 
for any producing oil field to use another substance for EOR?

John, I really appreciate your willingness to help unearth this information.  
The priority on this matter is urgent, so we would be extra grateful for a 
prompt response.  Please do not hesitate to call me at 713-853-6304, Russell 
Dyk at 713-853-7332, or Ken Shulklapper at 713-853-7009 for any further 
questions or comments.

Sincerely,

Anthony

Subject: EnronCredit Move

John, I need your help again.  Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting 
to move to level 14.  There are several problems with this move.


1.  This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to 
support them.
 a.  The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk).
 b.  Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more 
cabling for the turrets.
  There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling
 c.  AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer 
manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.
  The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in 
late December.
  Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 2001.

2.  This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems.
 a.  Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.

3.  The Response Time would be affected.
 a.  The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA 
trading floors.
  A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, 
Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.
  Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs 
for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group.
 b.  We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on 
Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.
  The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.

4.  There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be 
susceptible to power outages.


I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to 
move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.  Level 29 has been 
completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is 
also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.  This floor has been built out with 
Trading Desk furniture as well.

My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; 
this will save the company both money and time.  Your help is needed to 
convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.

Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.

Thanks,

If you've had a corp fin class about int rates, bonds, etc, I'd take the 
Funding Investments class.  
Have a great weekend.

Hi Jeff-
Hope things are well with you.  Classes started here this week and I'm
still getting my schedule straigtened out.  Fortunately, I got into the
Speculative Markets course.  However, I still need to choose a second
finance class.

I have until friday at 3 PM EST to choose between FIXED INCOME (dealing
primarily with bond replication, fairly quantitative) and FUNDING
INVESTMENTS (a broad examination of how firms finance investment with
corporate securities).

Which of the two do you think would help me out the most at Enron Global
Markets?  Sorry for the short notice, but I just won the course permit
tonight!

Thanks,
Matthew

Below is feedback from Dow on the presentation that Mark Palmer did on 1/24 
to Dow's global operations leaders.  It was a big success.  Mark will be 
debriefing Jeff Skilling on the presentation and what they discussed.  Jeff 
Skilling is to meet with Mike Parker, President and CEO Dow Chemical in late 
April to discuss how Enron and Dow can work more closely together.  Let me 
know if you need  further information from me.

Thank you.

Dear Carrie,

first of all thanks for your patience and support ! 

Mark was "worldclass" ! After the meeting we collected feedback, where we
asked the participants for the presentations which exceeded the
expectations....and "Enron" was clearly number one !

So it was the subject itself, but also Mark as a speaker ! Your choice was
absolutely to the "point" !

Our company has agressive goals in terms of revenue growth...and all these
guys, who were in this room have somehow to do with it.
I think the Enron case just opened up a field of ideas and thinking to break
with our traditional business frame.

So it was exactly the right time.

Again, I can only say thank you for a great presentation and a great speaker
!

Please let Mark know, how well he did !

best regards

Rudi

sincerely appreciated your comments and support.
I hope your Holidays were safe, healthy, and happy.  Say when am I going to

Subject: EGM Analyst and Associates Development

Mike and Jeff:

Every Wednesday, we have a team seminar where our group reviews topics of 
interest and relevance to our markets and our company. It is my goal to use 
these seminars as a learning and information exchange tool. The weekly topics 
range from instructional (basics of swaps and futures) to team-building 
exercises.  With this in mind, I was hoping that each of you could commit to 
a Wednesday seminar for 1 hour to review your careers at Enron and discuss 
what you did to become successful. The seminars are open to all analysts / 
associates in EGM/ ENA trading. I intend to ask each  EGM  business head to 
participate as well. I am hoping that your seminars will work as an informal 
mentoring exercise as providing guidance to our new people on how to have a 
successful career.


The seminars usually begin at 4 p.m. I hope each of you will participate. 
Please let me know your availability. There is no need to bring a 
presentation, as the meetings are very informal.

Thanks
Jen

I visited the Networks-sponsored Houston Technology Center and had a chance 
to interview with all the people working there. I believe that a rotation 
there could give me the opportunity to learn a great deal about the 
entrepreneurial/technology circles and at the same be a good tie-back to 
enron for my third stage. I would appreciate any suggestions or comments you 
might have. Again, thank you for your help.

Bjarne was reviewed as a part of Enron Europe this time and his promotion was 
based on a long period of  high performance.   He is viewed as one of the 
most valuable people in the business and there was no controversy whatsoever 
in London about his promotion.   In fact I repeatedly get calls for his 
services from various groups around Europe who would love to hire him if they 
had the opportunity.  In Oslo he has been one of the main contributors behind 
most off our models, and I think that the job he has done with setting up the 
Weather desk here in Oslo deserves very positive feedback, even if we didn't 
make money last year.  We have really moved up the deal flow and are poised 
for an outstanding year 2001 in Weather.

In the future I will obviously cross check all things like this with you and 
Mark, so there aren't any misunderstandings going forward.  

Regards 

Thor

Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.  

Jeff

Hopefully Brunei LNG/Shell won't beat us to the punch.  You can bet that Mr. 
Damit at Brunei LNG gets his intelligence from Shell who no doubt are working 
on this already
(Shell is in a JV that just rolled out an online shipping capacity/freight 
trading business this month).
The first one to launch an LNG Trading internet platform will have an 
incredible advantage over all others.

06:19 GMT  14 September 2000  

PATTAYA, Thailand (Dow Jones)--Online liquefied natural gas trading is on the 
way and will challenge the way business in the industry is done, 
Mohammed Damit, head of LNG marketing for Brunei LNG Sdn Bhd, said this week 
at a gathering of gas industry executives. 

"It's only a matter of time before we see energy trading activities on the 
net," Damit said, adding that the biggest LNG online opportunities are
in ship chartering and spot LNG trading. 

Damit said online trading would result in greater price volatility. 

LNG prices are currently indexed to crude oil prices, in term contracts for 
as long as 20-30 years, that tend to smooth out price fluctuations 
over the life of the contract. 

Damit added that online traders will use standardized documents, simplifying 
trading.

Jeff,
As you suggested last week, I am letting you know that I have yet to hear
from Jeff about setting something up.  I did manage to speak with Michelle
about what she is doing and I was exited about what she had to say.  let me
know how proactive I should be about getting in touch with Jeff.  Hope you

Bobby retires this month, but will continue as a consultant to Enron India.  
His stated intention is to shadow Clay and his team to help arrange LNG 
supplies for Metgas.  We do not need this and it adds a layer of confusion 
whenever he is in attendance in negotiations, but to date neither Wade nor 
Sanjay has been willing or able to control this.  The India group tends to 
blame their failure to market Metgas supplies on the LNG team's "failure" to 
get better terms, and they insist that Bobby or others attend the meetings to 
ensure that we are doing a good job.

We believe that we have obtained LNG for Metgas on favorable terms, 
particularly in light of the fact that we have convinced Malaysia and Abu 
Dhabi to accept the credit risk of Metgas customers, i.e., with no Ennron 
support in the middle and no Indian government support behind the buyers).  
They believe that our supplies are priced 50 cents above the "market", which 
they perceive to be Qatari supplies to Petronet ( a proposed 
government-backed LNG import project in Western India that is a long way from 
being real).    

We believe that we know the pricing terms for the proposed Petronet deal and 
that the price is not as low as rumored.  We also believe that the Metgas 
customers are willing to pay the price that we have negotiated and that the 
Metgas pipeline economics are sound (although the India group has been 
unwilling to share their economics with us) and that, once the LNG contracts 
are in place, we can reduce the LNG price significantly via a backhaul from 
Malaysia using ADGAS/TEPCO ships.   We can further reduce the price if we can 
get access to the spare capacity on the ship dedicated to DPC and use it to 
move incremental cargoes from Abu Dhabi to Metgas.

Bobby and his team want us to reopen the price in the Mayasia term sheet.  We 
do not intend to do this.  Malaysia has told us that they will walk the deal 
if we insist on a lower price.  Malaysia recently sold additional volumes to 
Japan for a price about 20 cents higher than the price to Metgas and they 
believe they can also sell our volumes at a higher price to more creditworthy 
buyers in the far east.

The Malaysia COI includes a cp that Metgas will finalize contracts with its 
end buyers by Sep 1999.  We have repeatedly  gotten Malaysia to extend this 
target date, which is now end October 2000, but Malaysia is getting impatient 
with India and I am not sure how much longer we can hold this together 
without some more firm evidence from India that the markets are real

I will be in India on Oct 4/5 to meet with Sanjay and Wade to discuss this.  
We will also try to finalize the terms for us to provide LNG  fuel management 
and shipping services to both DPC and Metgas, and will seek clarification 
from Wade/Sanjay as to how they intend to sell down DPC/Metgas without losing 
control of the LNG terminal.  Clay, V V RAo and Wayne Perry will be with me.

Working with India is never easy

Rick

A Syrian, Egyptian and Lebanese memorandum of understanding to transport, 
market natural gas
Regional, Economics, 12/16/2000
In the presence of the Lebanese prime minister Rafik al- Hariri a memorandum 
of understanding was signed on Friday in Beirut between Syria, Egypt and 
Lebanon on the transportation and marketing of natural gas.

On the Syrian side the memo. Was signed by minister of oil Maher Jammal and 
minister of oil in Egypt Sameh Fahmi and the Lebanese side was attended by 
Muhammad Abdul hamid Beydoun, the minister of energy and waters, in the 
presence of the secretary general of the Syrian- Lebanese higher council Nasr 
al-Kouri.

The project aims at transporting Egyptian and Syrian gas prepared for 
exportation to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and European countries to market it to 
meet the local demands of gas in these countries.

In a statement to pressmen following the signing ceremony, the Egyptian 
minister said the pipeline worth US $ 1 billion and that it would start near 
al-Arish in Egypt in Northern Egypt and run under the waters of the 
Mediterranean to Lebanon and Turkey through Syria.

The Syrian minister stressed the importance of the project which constitutes 
a turning point in boosting joint regional Arab co-operation and which 
signifies a vivid example on integrated Arab economy.

For his part, the Lebanese minister said that this project will strengthen 
the economic potentials of the participating countries and have positive 
impact on their general conditions.

I think doing a EGM only prc is probably the right way to go.  We will need 
to do a good job (and have the ability to cross calibrate) understanding the 
other business units performance as well.

Subject: Out of Office

I have been selected by Enron to attend a two week Global Consulting Alliance 
HR Leadership Program in Ann Arbor.  I'll be out of the office beginning 
Monday, October 2, returning on Monday, October 16.

In my absence, Shanna Funkhouser will be handling all EGM issues.  David 
Oxley has offered his assistance during this 2 week period as well.  I will 
be in touch with both Shanna and David while I'm gone to address any critical 
issues.  I have asked Shanna to attend the EGM OOC Staff Meetings in my 
absence.  

On another note, and I recognize there are signficant business issues you 
both are dealing with, but we need to start thinking about the PRC process.  
Specific questions that EGM business heads have asked are:

 With the exception of VP's and above, do we want to isolate EGM employees 
and review them only within EGM, regardless of location?

 Or, do we want to segregate those EGM employees below VP that were formerly 
EEL or ENA and review them separately with EEL or ENA?

  (ex., Europe, Singapore, Sydney, etc. employees review with EEL;  North 
American based employees review with ENA

 We'll have to integrate the former CALME employees as well.

 
Shawna and I have ascertained that your management team would prefer a 
separate EGM PRC so employees can be evaluated with peers in global emerging 
markets, rather than with mature (and high revenue generating) markets like 
North America gas and power.

Obviously, this is your call.  But time is growing near to plan for whatever 
direction we decide to go in.  The PRC system opens for feedback on approx. 
10/20/00.  PRC meetings need to be held between 11/20/00 and 12/15/00.

Thanks,

Cindy

Good afternoon Ida  (better name for you than me).  EC was uneventful, given 
that I wore no crazy hat.  At the right time though.  I know the party will 
be great--try not to stress too much, besides your plans sounded great and 
I'm sure everyone will have a great time.  I'm leaving in a little while to 
go to the closing ( and collect some cash!), and am out the rest of the 
afternoon--cruising in the ida-mobile!  In case you were wondering, I used 
almost  a half mile of bubble wrap yesterday moving my art to the new house 
and will recycle it if there are some cool kid things to do with it.  Ideas? 

Later.

Ted,
This is the resume of someone I know socially (through Houston Ballet Guild) 
who happens to work for Azurix.  He, like so many others over there, really 
would like to explore opportunities at Enron.  He has a very strong resume 
and is someone I think we should really take a look at.  He realizes he may 
have to take a step down to make the transition.  Who would you suggest we 
forward him to?

Looks like they've got good participation from IBs.  The fact that they are 
having it at one of the most expensive places in the city leads me to believe 
that they are putting a lot of effort into strong attendance and putting 
together a good conference.  Of course that is also why sponsorship is so 
expensive.  Do you want me to take care of signing us up?  Jeff, any ideas 
for panelists?

Hi Michele

thanks for getting back to me with regards to the finance conference.
I am in the process of collecting the committed speaker list. Just
wanted to give you a flavor for kind of people that we are targeting.

The major committed sponsors so far are some of the top investment banks
(Chase, Merrill
Goldman, MSDW) and we are lining up the either heads of investment banking,
asset management or some well know research analysts from these firms to
adress the panelists and the conference attendees.

I will have specific names for you in a couple of days are we are still in
the
process of confirming speakers.

The conference will be at the Park Hyatt in Center City along with the
Bullish
on Finance reception the previous day.

This conference will be a good platform for Enron to talk about its unique
position in trading and can utilize the Sales and Trading panel to expose
the
students and the conference attendees to Enrons capabilities and the firm in
general.

I will provide you with more information in the coming days and I sincerely
hope
you will choose to sponsor one of the panels and have a strong presence at
the finance conference this year.

Regards
Suresh

Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the 
gas trading h.r. people with respect to robin menear.  she was listed as 
commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a 
commercial manager.  Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class, even though 
this was a problem at mid year as well.   Of course he told me it had been 
taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over 
her history, and what my intent was when i hired her.  he too was involved in 
the hiring decision.

Shall i do brad's termination, or will you.

Rick,

I understand that Ken Lay will officially open the Enron Japan office around 
the 1st of November. We should make sure that our key LNG contacts are 
invited to the ceremony, especially our joint venture partners in the Lakshmi 
and the builders of the Lakshmi. Other key companies we should consider would 
be Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas, and Mitsubishi.

Jeff,

It was a pleasure seeing you at the ENA party earlier this month. Thank you 
for your help and advice with regards to my new rotation. I am enjoying the 
new work immensely and have the opportunity to review all sort of new 
technologies and business plans. We recently  came up with the idea of 
creating a separate program aimed at the big energy companies in Houston 
whereby the generation of new ideas and technologies aimed at the energy 
industry could be outsourced to the Houston Technology Center and therefore 
benefit from a level of freedom and flexibility that is difficult to achieve 
within the hierarchical structures of most big energy players in town. These 
"idea labs" would be set up as separate companies and would only require 
funding from investors such as Shell, Exxon Mobil, and the likes. I assume 
that Enron would not be particularly interested  given its own internal 
entrepreneurial spirit although it could benefit from the exposure to such 
new  ventures and potentially find candidates with technologies it might 
want  to invest in. This idea was just recently floated and no real steps 
have been taken in any direction which is why I am wondering if I can ask you 
for your opinion. Please let me know of any questions you might have and have 
a wonderful holiday.

Again thank you and my best wishes for the New Year
Massimo

Thanks for the email.  Actually, you are completely wrong about my view of 
Joe.  He has tremedous integrity, and is a very strong team builder, and has 
added much value to our organization.  I was however a little surprised by 
your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position.  I would 
have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind 
of capacity here, or in london, or elsewhere if you liked.  In addition, I 
could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products.  
(Which I will remind you about frequently)

I'm sure your decision will prove valuable to Joe, and hopefully to you as 
well.  Mike and I would like to see you back on the A-team though--we both 
respect your business sense.

As far as the guilt thing goes, I can't help you.  I'm Jewish and our people 
have suffered much longer than everyone else combined.

Subject: Re: EOL and the brokers  

My views are as follows:
We have lost business on what I am doing (dated brent vs frontline IPE) to 
ICE. For the future we need something more to combat ICE and other systems. 
Getting the brokers on our side could be the answer. The benefits I can see 
are:
a. We will reach a wider crowd using the brokers. Today there are companies 
who will not turn on our system despite personal visits and other marketing. 
They seem to prefer speaking to brokers.
b. We could gain neutrality if the broker could transact on EOL on behalf of 
the customer. The biggest problem when I speak to customers seems to be that 
by dealing with Enron on EOL the customer is afraid of giving us to much of 
information of what they are doing.
c. The brokers are scared for the future. They think they are about to die 
out due to electronic trading. Enron should be able to strike a good deal 
with the broker. Maybe even get paid ?
d. Enron would gain a free marketing force thru the brokers.

Subject: EOL and the brokers

I have been contacted by ICAP and Man regarding different co-ops between EOL 
and the services provided by these brokers. Icap wants Enron to be the market 
maker for the ICAP electronic system (swap-net) , MAN wants to represent EOL 
to the market and act as a principal between Enron and Man customers.

There are benefits and draw-backs using the brokers. I have my views on the 
matter.  

Jeff, what is our policy for EOL regarding working with the brokers?

recruiting, and for you to meet some more pretty senior people in the 
world--but I forget, you know most of them already.....Jeff

Subject: Wharton Entrepreneurship Conference

Tom,
I am the commercial team lead for recruiting at Wharton and I'd like to 
invite you to speak on a panel at the Wharton Entrepreneurship Conference on 
Friday, December 1 in Philadelphia.  We are the platinum sponsors of the 
conference and really want to have a panelist like you, who exemplifies the 
innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities at Enron.  The timing of the 
panel is essential to recruiting - later that day candidates will be coming 
to Houston for Super Saturday.  The panel topic is Intrapreneurship, Being an 
Entrepreneur within a Corporation.  Other panelists include Dan Powers, 
Director of IBM Early Stage Internet
Technology along with someone from American Express' Strategy/Business 
Development side.  Jonathan Seelig, founder and Sr. VP Strategy of Akamai is 
the keynote speaker of the conference.  Speaking on the panel would entail 
flying up to Philadelphia on the afternoon of Thursday, Nov. 30 and attending 
the opening cocktail reception from 7-8:30pm.  They keynote address is from 
6-7pm, if you would like to attend that as well.  The panel itself is from 10 
- 11:15 am on Friday, December 1, so you could be back in Houston as early as 
4:45.  If you would like additional information, Their website is 
www.wec2000.net.  Could you please give me a call to let me know if you would 
be able to participate in the conference?

Regards,

Michele Nezi Marvin

BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE IN THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY (SOURCING AND SELLING TO 
LARGE/INDUSTRIAL CLIENTS) I AM INTERESTED IN APPLYING FOR A JOB I SAW ON 
ENRON'S WEBSITE.  THERE IS AN OPENING IN THE "WHOLESALE, RETAIL & COMM ENERGY 
SERVICES" FOR A POWER REP IN NY. BUT, I AM AFRAID IF I SEND MY RESUME TO THE 
HUMAN RESOURCE DEPT, THEY WILL BE CONFUSED BY MY ENTERTAINMENT / FERTILIZER 
EXPERIENCE.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF THERE IS ANYONE YOU KNOW, AT ENRON 
NY, THAT I CAN MEET WITH PERSONALLY.  IN A MEETING I CAN EXPLAIN MY 
EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS BETTER THAN I CAN IN MY RESUME.  I WAS VERY 
GOOD AT SOURCING CLIENTS AND ESTABLISHING LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS FOR 
FERTILIZERS AND BELIEVE THAT I CAN TRANSFER THAT SKILL TO ENERGY.
BEST REGARDS,
RINA

A brief summary of stats from the month of December.  Volumes were off a bit 
from November, reflective of the seriousness with which members of the 
coal/shipping community take the holiday season - however, exponential growth 
from summer period continues.  This has exacerbated systems and back office 
problems we have been having for the past year, thus internal focus during Q1 
will be on this issue.

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always
recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.

Jeff --

I was talking to a mutual friend -- Kara Price Edwards -- last night, and she 
asked if I knew you.   She asked that I give you her best.   FYI, she's two 
weeks away from giving birth to her second child.   

Hope you're doing well.

SUMMARY

ATLANTIC

Mixed signals coming from the market at present with Billiton approaching us 
to buy FOB stem at RBCT for a cargo each Q2/Q3 and were active for the first 
time in a while in the SECA market buying up 2nd half 2001 material. 
Meanwhile there remains to be South African resell tonnage coming our way - 
predominantly appearing by way of the Spanish utilities who continue to have 
excellent hydro levels and ourability to source South African Call Options on 
FOB RBCT level with strike of $32.50 seems to question the recent information 
that Billitonsold tonnage at $33.25 equivalent into European consumers for 
the rest of the year Furthermore for the first time this year we begin to see 
Colombian resell material appearing on the market both on a CIF and FOB basis 
- probably no coincidence that this comes at a time when some of the steam 
seems to have come off the U.S. spot market. Overall the tone seems to be 
firmer but with very few new fundamental inputs to fuel this but rather 
producer sentiment  After weeks of tentatively drifting south the SECA market 
traded up a dollar along the whole curve last week. This was really a 
consequence of a few looking to buy into a market void of sellers which was 
itself is directly a function of peoples unwillingness to further sponsor a 
market which has come down some $5 from it's high's. The spot market is now 
trading at $40.50 Fob barge Rotterdam, 2nd half of the year at $40.25 and 
then 2002 at $39.50.

PACIFIC

Despite the extensive coverage which the Far East seems to be attracting with 
regards to economic slowdowns/weakness the Pacificmarket continues to be 
tight. The JSM/Producers continue their annual negotiations, but expect to 
see few conclusions from these in theshort term as the JSM's continue to 
exercise all the options they have to keep the drip feed going and most have 
clauses in their contractswhich allow them to carry on shipping material 
despite any agreement until September time. Both KEPCO and Lafarge have come 
out with tenders for the delivery of coal for prompt shipment - it is 
definitely a sign of progress that we are being invited to bid but without 
any length with which to play with, going short in front of Glencore and Rio 
could be expensive - the plan will be to participate without winning the 
business. The Chinese Annual Coal Fair took place over the last cuppla weeks 
where contracts for 2001 are negotiated and various sectors lobbyfor their 
allocation on infrastructure. The major takeaway's from the meeting were that 
total production is estimated at 950 million mt for 2001with exports targeted 
at 63 million mt - up 5 million mt from last year. Despite increased export 
targets, the sentiment remains bullish with most producers asking between $29 
and $31 representing a $3/$4 increase versus 2000 prices. Strong domestic 
prices will limit any downside in the export market and while the government 
is keen to keep pushing exports there is a general  scepticism over the 
ability of the rail to move the projected tonnage. We have signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding with a producer based in Inner Mongolia (ZCIC)to 
market upto 1 million mt per year into the export market - all going well 
this will provide us with the necessary length to be able to target business 
in the region more aggressively.

GAMEPLAN

We continue to try and take advantage of this mismatch between the origin 
markets and the European market by selling out of origin lengthand using the 
resell market to pick up tonnage to service our commitments at destination. 
We are working several bits of long-term destinationbusiness in the Atlantic 
which if successful will serve as a melting pot for any length we have 
remaining in that basin and more. We will alsolook to sell into any further 
rally in the destination SECA mkt. Despite fundamentals in Asia pointing to a 
slowdown in demand the consolidation we are seeing in Australia will 
certainly prevent any collapse in prices and short-term expect prices to head 
higher than the $30 I wud call FOB Newcastle today. It will be very difficult 
for us to get any ammunition for the near-term but we are looking at various 
projects which will again give us access to coal further out in the curve and 
at the same time are exploring any opportunity to own some optionality to 
give us some protection against a continued squeeze further out in the curve.

Best Regards
Jez

Jeff:

Attached you will find three files:

1) The brief description of the Envera deal you requested. ("deal summary 
final")
2) A diagram showing one potential view of how the e-Marketplace for 
Chemicals will look and where Enron would fit in. ("deal summary e-commerce 
marketplace")
3) A slide from Envera displaying their connectivity concept.  Enron will 
participate as a Member, a Service Provider and an Owner. ("basic envera 
concept")

Deals obviously are never done till they're done, but this one is 95+ % 
there.  We've received Envera Board Approval and signatures from 1/3 of the 
Owners' granting consent to issue equity to Enron.


Thanks to both you and John for your support.  We could not have come this 
far without it.

Below are the primary DCF assumptions:

1.  WACC = 11%

2.  EBIT from existing business was calculated as an average of 1999 and 2000 
with certain adjustments.  Growth rate is 4% per annum.

3.  Financial trading earnings estimates as per John Nowlan are as follows 
(urea and ammonia only):  
Yr 1 - $0.5MM
Yr 2 - $2.5MM
Yr 3 - $5.0MM
Yr 4 - $7.8MM
Yr 5 and future - $10.3MM per year

4.  Origination earnings estimates as per John Nowlan are as follows (all 
products):
Yr 1 - $5MM
Yr 2 - $10MM
Yr 3 - $20MM
Yr 4 - $25MM
Yr 5 - $30MM
Future - $5MM incremental earnings every year

5.  Working capital requirements continue to grow at the same pace (ie. no 
efficiency in working capital assumed).

6.  $2MM of capex every three years for capital improvements (in addition to 
annual maintenance items that are expensed on the Income Statement.)

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are

hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Joe,  

Saar Banin's work number in the UK at Goldman is 0207 774 6181.  He had been 
in metals for them for some time, and just moved over to gas and power (in 
the UK)  He's an aggressive, smart guy who I've known for 10 years.  Top 
notch.

Hope all is well

Gentlemen:

Below is an email and resume from a person I met recently through mutual 
friends.  I have not dealt with her in a business context and can't comment 
positively or negatively on her capabilities.  She seems bright and 
personable from my brief conversation with her.  Given the shortage of 
traders we constantly seem to face, I thought it worthwhile forwarding her 
resume.

If you have any interest, feel free to contact Pamela directly.  If you would 
like me to call on your behalf, I would be happy to do so.

Dear Jim,

I really enjoyed meeting you on Friday  night.

I am very interested in talking to you about a  career opportunity at Enron.? 
I would appreciate any advice or assistance  you could provide.? I do know 
Jeff Shankman.? However, he is very hard  to get in touch with.? You 
mentioned on Friday that you would not mind  giving him a call for me.
?
I know that my knowledge and experience would be a  great asset to the team 
at Enron.
?

I have attached my resume for your review.?  The resume?details my 
accomplishments in the  Natural Gas?business.? However, my marketing, trading 
and management  skills?are transferable to any commodity?in any industry.? 
Some  of my past accomplishments include:? proven track record in marketing 
of a commodity; established customer base  across a multi state region; 
successful in?achieving regional goals and  exceeding profit targets; utilize 
analytical skills in developing strategy for  meeting customer needs; 
experience in educating and providing?internal and  external customers with 
derivative and financial products to meet the customer  needs; customer base 
includes brokers, marketers, producers, utilities and end  users. 
?

I have?provided  some additional information about my background below:
?
I am a highly successful sales and marketing  professional.? I have over nine 
years  experience and a proven track record in the Natural Gas Industry.? My  
experience ranges from marketing, origination,?running a desk and profit  
center in trading, market making, and management.? Most recently I ran a  
regional trading desk and profit center?at TXU Energy Trading.? My  
responsibilities included managing both a financial and physical trading  
book.? I made nine million dollars in marked-to-market profits over the  last 
three years.? My experience includes extensive customer contact, the  
trading?of financial natural gas swaps, utilizing derivatives, and movement  
of physical gas.? I have demonstrated performance as a competent trader and  
desk head.? In addition, I have participated as part of the management team  
at TXU Energy Trading for the last three years.?With? electricity 
deregulation approaching, TXU made the decision to  redefine their business 
plan which included shutting down the proprietary  trading side of the 
business.? This meant the shutting down of the Houston  Office.??I?made the 
decision not to move to Dallas. 
?

This is a changing time for the Natural Gas  Industry and I believe that the 
consolidation of companies or trading  organizations will continue to 
consolidate.???My marketing and trading experience resides in Natural Gas?in 
the  east/gulf but feel that I could apply my financial and physical  
trading/marketing skills?to any region or  commodity.??I am  very good 
at?developing strategy for trading or marketing utilizing  historical 
analysis and current trends.? I?very interested in  a?career opportunity

I went to talk to Steve Horn this morning and he seemed happy with the idea 
of me going over to HTC. I will now work on settling a date for me to 
transfer. I am very happy about this experience and want to express my 
gratitude for all your help and suggestions. I will definitely let you know 
how it is once I move over there.

Again, thank you.

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with 
each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition.  It is 
important that both business units work together to determine which 
individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will 
begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious 
that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the 
synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power 
businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

Thanks.  This is helpful.  I like all the products you've mentioned below, 
except for the MTBE one.  Is there a real market need for this?  Please 
proceed and get the others on EOL asap.  Also please pass the trade idea you 
have to Fred Lagrasta's group.

Subject: EOL Products

Following are my sugestions for the next three EOL gasoline products;

1. 2nd month NYMEX UNL
2. MTBE front month swap, U S Gulf fixed price.
3. Cal 02 UNL gasoline crack spread (this one probably requires VAR increase)
4. WTI swaps that match the timing of our gasoline and HO cracks. This gives 
customers the option to convert crack spread positions to fixed price 
gasoline and HO swaps through EOL.


Regarding long dated gasoline positions we are long 75 kb per month cal 02 
gulf coast gas cracks which probably won't move much in value until 
march/April 01. I view this position as very low risk and good profit 
potential but this position does tie up VAR. If marketing can sell at $3.80 
or better happy to get out of this for now. This is the only long dated 
position in my book.

This is another reason why the HR and A/A program don't like each other.  
It's absurd that our personnell functions don't share resources.  I'm almost 
of the opinion that these two groups should be folded together.

Jeff,

Happy Holidays!

I met with the Wharton Club of Houston yesterday. The president is
Jon E. Zagrodsky, assistant principal at McKinsey. They are trying 
to get the club "restarted" again. They are planning on having some
social events next year, as well as some speaker events. The club
is partially supported by the school. I will be providing them with
the email addresses of all wharton undergraduates here at Enron, 
as well as in other companies. Would you like to be in their distribution
list? The club is for undergrads as well as for grads.

Let me know what you think.

Subject: Invitation to the EUROFORUM Conference "Emissions Trading"

I received the message below from you, forwarded from Steve Kean severral 
weeks ago asking if we wanted to send anyone to speak at this conference, 
which John Palmisano previously spoke at.

They have suggested that Jeff speak on the topic of "Joint Implementation 
(JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as a business opportunity."   
While Palmisano was focused on these issues in the past, it seems to me that 
the current Enron strategy does not really include pursuing "business 
opportunities" related to these mechanisms, as they involve investment of 
capital in power projects in developing countries.  I don't think it would be 
a good fit for us at all right now.

While emissions traders in EGM are looking at the Kyoto process and the 
potential for global carbon trading, we are still a long way from there being 
any viable trading market whatsoever.  EES is interested in following the JI 
and CDM issues for potential opportunities related to energy efficiency.   
Our role has been to participate in the process and monitor the development 
of these issues and see if there are effects on our markets or 
opportunities.   I may have someone attend or may see if someone in Mark 
Schroeder's group in London can attend, but I would not recommend our 
speaking at this time.  

Please let me know if you have any questions,

Jeff Keeler

I'm picking out the carpet this weekend--so I'll also run out and get a 
picnic basket!  Your desert capabilities are impressive!  (Next time I'll get 
a quart of whipped cream instead of a pint so you can have twice as much, and 
I can win our contest)

You are a lot of fun--I like hanging out with you.

you ever seen a girl put away so much dessert?  I am actually known for it!  
Mark almost died the first time he saw me eat dessert!!!  I am only coming 
for dinner again if you promise we can have homemade whipped cream.  I think

FYI -- the CNN/USA Today poll today will likely  show Bush up by 13 points 
over Gore.

Recall that this is the wildly volatile poll,  however, and could, as it has 
in recent weeks, flip back just a  quickly.

Jeff,
 This weekend while I was at Penn I spent some time with Gary (he interned 
with us last summer) and found out that he has received an offer from JP 
Morgan for Trading.  It is a pretty good offer overall but I still think that 
Enron is a better opportunity and we just need to convince him of that.  I 
was hoping you could take a few minutes out to call him and talk to him about 
it.  I really thought we would be able to have him sign full-time but now 
this throws a little curveball into things.  His home number is 215-386-4251 
and his cell phone number is 215-432-5635.  This is a really bright, great 
guy that I think would end up becoming a major asset to Enron.  If there is 
anything I can do please let me know, but I'm sure hearing from you will make 
a difference.

Sarah

Ted,
This is the resume of someone I know socially (through Houston Ballet Guild) 
who happens to work for Azurix.  He, like so many others over there, really 
would like to explore opportunities at Enron.  He has a very strong resume 
and is someone I think we should really take a look at.  He realizes he may 
have to take a step down to make the transition.  Who would you suggest we 
forward him to?

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin

group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

I appreciate any assistance or advice you could  give about?career 
opportunities at Enron.? Even though my experience  reside in Natural Gas, I 
am very interested in expanding my career into other  commodities.? I know 
that Enron leads the energy industry as far as  offering cutting edge 
products to the market place.
?
I have attached my resume?as we  discussed.
?
Also, I have provided some additional information  about my background below:
I am a highly successful sales and marketing  professional.? I have over nine 
years  experience and a proven track record in the Natural Gas Industry.? My  
experience ranges from marketing, origination,?running a desk and profit  
center in trading, market making, and management.? Most recently I ran a  
regional trading desk and profit center?at TXU Energy Trading.? My  
responsibilities included managing both a financial and physical trading  
book.? I made nine million dollars in marked-to-market profits over the  last 
three years.? My experience includes the trading?of financial  natural gas 
swaps, utilizing derivatives, and movement of physical gas.? I  have 
demonstrated performance as a competent trader and desk head.? In  addition, 
I have participated as part of the management team at TXU Energy  Trading for 
the last three years.??
With? electricity deregulation approaching,  TXU made the decision to 
redefine their business plan which included shutting  down the proprietary

Re: Iraq/OPEC Update

Sources assess that the US will not confront Iraq over its demand to switch 
its oil transactions from dollars to euros, and therefore no major disruption 
in Iraqi exports is expected on the November 1 deadline set by Iraq for the 
switch.  The worst-case scenario now seen is a very brief "hiccup" in exports 
for a period of 1-3 days as the euro account is created and the letters of 
credit are arranged for November liftings.

Sources report that Saudi Arabia has reconciled its internal differences and 
now favors an OPEC production increase of 500,000 b/d according to the 
"trigger mechanism."  It is expected that the decision to increase output 
will be announced on Friday October 27 or Monday October 30.

Hi Hillary, hope you are well.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it 
tomorrow.  I just couldn't work out the schedule, but it was extremely 
thoughtful of you to invite me.  I hope you have a great time.....(I'll send 
something to Ben in the gallery tomorrow)...

Dear Rick and Clay:

I thought you you would be interested in a "look-in-advance" at the article

Clay, sorry I missed you this time around in September when I was in the
Middle East.  For your guidance, we heard a lot of nice things from OLNG
management about you guys -- and well deserved I may add.

Best regards,

fine if you keep me up to speed.  But I do not expect to does this for free.  
What do we want related to this?  Did you know Exmar exercised the options?  
Apparently they want to work with us--on this ship.  What do we want related

=09=09 Subject: Asian Credit Watch- AP & P

Per our conversations with most of you this week, Brendan and I have=20
developed the following information on Asian Pulp & Paper and its potential=
=20
to trigger widescale credit problems in Asia.  In the past week, APP has co=
me=20
close to default through complex trigger clauses in a mass of junk bond=20
issues. Prospects of an APP default have already sent tremors through the=
=20
Asian bond market and could have larger implications for emerging market=20
debt. This week, the Indonesian government further complicated the picture =
by=20
attaching assets of the Sinar Mas group, including APP, to guarantees of=20
Sinar Mas group=01,s $1.5 billion debt to Bank Internasional Indonesia (BII=
),=20
Indonesia=01,s fifth largest bank and formerly part of a Sinar Mas group.  =
The=20
Wijaya family is likely to postpone payments until the last possible minute=
,=20
before seeking a workout and corporate restructuring.

RJ

The Immediate Problem

o $1.6 billion in bonds are due in 2001, on top of $1.5 billion owed to the=
=20
Indonesian government through the Sinar Mas group
o Between now and April 30, the APP group must come up with $145 million fo=
r=20
nine separate coupon payments coming due. APP itself will owe $87 million i=
n=20
interest payments on four bonds over the next month
o APP missed a February 1 deadline for two bond payments of $43 million; on=
e=20
payment has been made but the other, of $13.5 million, is still hanging

Risks are formidable, with management playing a cat and mouse game with bon=
d=20
holders in order to maximize their negotiating position in a restructuring:

o Assets are encumbered by complex cross-guarantees that make it difficult =
to=20
impossible to separate out individual properties
o The New York Stock Exchange has threatened a de-listing unless APP stock=
=20
rises above the US$1 level; de-listing will trigger immediate redemption=20
clauses in some classes of bonds
o The company=01,s Indonesian assets are diseased. Despite APP=01,s apparen=
tly=20
sound business model, it is being corrupted by crime that is systemic withi=
n=20
the Indonesian forestry and forest products industry
o Inventory dumping by APP, particularly in China, has been a major factor=
=20
depressing paper prices since mid-2000
o APP=01,s management has failed to offer transparent explanations for thei=
r=20
cash shortages. It has not reported third quarter earnings for 2000, due la=
st=20
November, to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (although, as a=20
foreign company it has six months to report earnings, versus one month for =
US=20
companies). Inter-company transfers may be masking serious problems within=
=20
the APP group.=20
o Indonesian political instability is worsening with the threatened=20
impeachment of Indonesia=01,s President Wahid, lowering prospects for a=20
government bailout of APP=01,s parent company, the Sinar Mas group, and its=
=20
owners, the Wijaya family.
o There are clear prospects for collateral damage to Asian capital markets,=
=20
with S&P already cutting ratings and a consequent shrinkage of liquidity.=
=20

APP Risk Profile:

APP=01,s only immediate hope of meeting its debt payments is through asset =
sales=20
or a sell-off of pulp and paper inventory. Neither has much chance of=20
success. APP=01,s current strategy is to muscle its bond-holders into a=20
restructuring agreement as soon as possible, most likely before an early=20
March deadline for its next coupon payment falls due. There are significant=
=20
obstacles to evaluation of assets in a restructuring, from cross-guarantees=
=20
of bond issues that range across classes of bond holders and various=20
jurisdictions, to inter-company transfers that present a false picture of=
=20
financial health in some of its operating companies. Such obstacles ensure=
=20
that a restructuring exercise will be lengthy. APP is the fifth largest=20
issuer of junk bonds in the world, and has been regarded as a benchmark bon=
d=20
for Indonesia. Until the last few months, it was the only bond in the world=
=20
that traded at a premium to its own government=01,s bonds, and was the only=
=20
Indonesian issuer to raise funds successfully from capital markets in the=
=20
depth of the Asian crisis. A pronounced ripple effect is likely on Asian=20
bonds in the event of a default, as investors wait to see what happens to=
=20
unsecured creditors who account for 40 percent to 50 percent of APP=01,s US=
$12=20
billion in debt. At the moment, systemic fallout seems likely to be limited=
=20
to the Asian region, as investors revert to the hostile stance adopted duri=
ng=20
the Asian financial crisis.=20

APP Key Decision Makers:

The key decision makers at APP are CFO Hendrik Tse and CEO Teguh Ganda=20
Wijaya. No others in the company are privy to all the Group=01,s Affairs, o=
r to=20
corporate strategy. Information is extremely closely held. Sources say that=
=20
the APP situation is so complex that no one individual has a comprehensive=
=20
understanding of all the potential ramifications of a decision on any one o=
f=20
the assets of APP or its subsidiaries, so complex are the cross guarantees=
=20
and trigger clauses in the debt paper issued over the last few years.

Tee and Teguh Wijaya are to a large extent playing a bluff game, engaging i=
n=20
brinkmanship with their bond holders. It signaled the market that it could=
=20
move into a default situation on February 1 when its paper making subsidiar=
y,=20
Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimiah, failed to make payments on two different bond=
=20
issues worth $43 million. On February 6, APP finally paid the coupon on one=
=20
of the bonds, a US$600 million note issued by Tjiwi Kimia Finance Mauritius=
,=20
just within a grace period of five business days. If Tjiwi Kimia had failed=
=20
to meet the deadline, it would have triggered cross default clauses on a=20
series of other bonds. The second coupon payment, of $13.5 million, for a=
=20
US$200 million issue of guaranteed senior notes due in 2001, is now late. W=
e=20
expect APP to wait until the last possible moment to make the payment. The=
=20
group is husbanding its cash in advance of an expected restructuring. The=
=20
better its cash position is, the more APP will be able to operate from a=20
position of strength in a restructuring negotiation.=20

According to one source: APP is =01&signaling the market and its bond holde=
rs=20
that it is in their best interest to help with a restructuring before=20
everything collapse. The idea is to squeeze the bondholders now, while they=
=20
still have some negotiating leverage rather than wait until there is nothin=
g=20
left.=018 APP is trying to play off one set of bond holders against another=
=20
because the interests of the bond holders in the operating companies, some =
of=20
which have significant cash flow, is different from those in the parent. Th=
is=20
is obviously a dangerous game, but one in which APP feels it has no choice=
=20
but to engage. The earlier it can restructure the better of it will be, and=
=20
the greater its chances of survival in some form. Trying to keep control of=
=20
the situation so that it doesn=01,t unravel is the name of the game at this=
=20
point. Tee and Widjaja are thinking quite far ahead and have targeted their=
=20
non-core subsidiaries for disposal in a debt restructuring. They have been=
=20
actively shopping their China assets for several months, and sources indica=
te=20
that their packaging assets will also go on the block. APP is still hopeful=
,=20
however, of engineering a debt restructuring so that it is on their terms.

One of the issues that adds greatly to the complexity of the situation is=
=20
that much of the sales from both companies come from within the group, and=
=20
often these go via another APP company or Sinar Mas. Another source said,=
=20
=01&This is a vertically integrated group and one of the worries is that if=
 you=20
start messing with the structure, let=01,s say one group of bond holders wa=
nts=20
to wind up one of the subsidiaries that is a primary customer, you could=20
threaten the whole group.=018=20

The Wijayas are well regarded by foreign investors, and are not in the=20
category of Suharto cronies such as forestry magnate Bob Hassan, who was=20
sentenced this past week to two years in jail for financial wrongdoings and=
=20
corruption. They are not saints =01) the Indonesian government removed the=
=20
Wijayas from the board of Bank Internasional Indonesia after it was=20
nationalized in 1999, based on evidence that they exceeded the 30 percent c=
ap=20
for lending to affiliates. However, they depend heavily on international=20
capital markets for funding and cannot afford significant steps that would=
=20
bar future access. At the moment, they have few alternatives to raise cash =
to=20
meet their debt payments other than through asset and inventory sales. The=
=20
company has built up substantial paper inventory, and according to one=20
source, it could use inventory sales to meet current cash obligations if it=
=20
could find a buyer. This is a big if, however, since current prices are=20
depressed and releasing further inventory to the market would only make=20
matters worse.

Asset Sales and Other Alternatives to Meet Debt Repayments:

An executive from a major international pulp and paper company confirmed th=
at=20
APP was actively trying to sell its Chinese assets.  These assets include:

o PT Ekamas Fortuna
o PT Purinusa Ekapersada
o Ningbo Zhonghua Paper
o Gold Hongye Paper
o Gold Hai Paper (Kunshan) Co.
o Jin Yu (Qingyuan) Tissue Paper Industry

The executive said that his company had looked at attractive parts of the=
=20
assets on offer, but had held back because of the impenetrable cross=20
guarantees between companies and reluctance of their bankers to finance an=
=20
acquisition at a discount that would offer no cover for their equity. The=
=20
executive believed that all the banks would have to agree to asset sales in=
=20
the context of a general restructuring before any individual bank would=20
finance an acquisition. Yet another issue is that the financing of the Chin=
a=20
factories was based on access to Indonesian pulp at intra-company prices.=
=20
Once the company is broken up into pieces, it will have to rely on the worl=
d=20
market and will no longer be able to produce at a profit. =20

Stora Enso made a formal bid for the assets last year but was rejected. It =
is=20
said to remain interested although the price it is willing to pay will be=
=20
considerably less. One of the problems with APP=01,s brinkmanship strategy =
is=20
that it is lowering the value of its assets. Companies will not be willing =
to=20
pay book value when it comes time for the company to sell off its non-core=
=20
assets.=20

Restructuring is imminent, creating opportunities for investors:

o A restructuring of the company in the near term seems inevitable and will=
=20
produce returns for existing bond holders if they bought at low enough pric=
es=20
and if their debt is secured by APP assets outside Indonesia
o A restructuring will release some of APP=01,s assets, which are considere=
d=20
attractive except for those in Indonesia. APP is the world=01,s low cost=20
producer of pulp and paper, with substantial assets in Indonesia, China, an=
d=20
India. Its Chinese factories are attractive despite current over-capacity i=
n=20
the domestic Chinese market. APP accounts for 20 percent of the Chinese=20
market for printing and fine paper.=20
o Some play is available from price volatility as APP continues to tease=20
investors by keeping them guessing about its actual cash situation

Hi Dave.  As a follow up to out conversation, I found out Robert Rauschenburg 
will be here April 5 or 6 and the weekend (April 7-8).  See how that looks on 
the calendar for y'all yankees to visit down here in rodeoland.  (I did go to 
the rodeo last night--hosted a big party--and wore my boots, and a cowboy hat 
my group gave me--pictures to follow)
Can you believe I went to the Rodeo?

Jeff "J. R." Shankdaddy

How are you?  The puppy is just getting huge.  He has the strongest paws.  I 
need to get him into obedience school.  He's  a bit too energetic and

Mr. Shankman:

     I am Dan Reck's new administrative assistant.  I initially interviewed
with Jennifer and Shanna Funkhouser and knew that they were both special.
However, since I have been here (an entire 5 days now!), Jennifer has been
invaluable to me.  On my first day at my desk, she called and asked me to
come to her office and she introduced me to Cathy Phillips and Yolanda
Martinez.  The reason for this e-mail is that I have encountered some
employee problems at my location and have confided in Jennifer.  Her
professionalism, eloquence and intelligence belies her youth.  As I am sure
you are aware, Jennifer is a diamond and she will only shine brighter as
her experience grows.  Life is short and I was raised to say nice things
when warranted.  I am so impressed with Jennifer  and I am proud and feel
privileged to be a member of her team.  Thank you for your time.

I'm doing okay.  Did I tell you I bought a truck?  It's a 1500 dodge ram.  
It's pretty neat.  I don't drive it in to work.  Parking is too expensive.  

I'm in the considering buying a home.  My former landlord referred me to a 
real estate agent.  I'd like to know how much house I can afford before I 
start looking at property.

Are you staying at your new house?

I believe Greg W. is coming to talk to you today about this new business.  
Further to this, I'd like to ask again how I can get access to VAR  (I 
believe Lavorato and Sherriff have $5 million they each keep upstairs and 
allocate to their businesses as needed temporarily).  Is this a Board 
question, or do you have the authority to allocate this VAR to me?  

On another note, I've been helping Bill Bradford with PGE exposure issues.  
If you too need my help, let me know.

Thanks for your help...

Per conversation with Greg this morning, until we get board approval for new 
book with VAR have agreed to use discretionary VAR as required to negate VAR 
effects within global products. Position P/L will have to be reported within 
Global Products but we will pull it out as a separate line item at the bottom 
of the report. Positions at this time are not an issue but should it  become 
a concern between now and approval of a new book we will need to address it 
as we are the VAR with discretionary limits.

Hi everyone!

Has Scott Yeager in EBS been asked to participate in this yet?  I know from 
voice mail exchanges that he was being mentioned.  I think he would be an 
excellent choice and do a great job. 

 Clearly, Louise would be great, but she has been bombarded with these 
requests and is having to decline most.

Thanks!

Another person who might be a good speaker is Louise Kitchen, who started 
Enron Online and is now COO or Enron Net Works.  A third is Tom Gros, also in 
Enron Net Works, who started our bandwidth trading business and is now 
developing some additional eCommerce capabilities for Enron Online.  How

speaking on the panel.   She also suggested Rex Shelby as a speaker - he is 
an MD in Net Works and was formerly part of EBS.  He has started at least two

Subject: lng shipping

jeff
long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

About a month ago, we asked EOL to create three new products for the

1.  propylene (polymer grade), 
2.  a polypropylene to propylene spread, and
3.  a polyethylene to ethylene spread.

We expect to have these rolled out this week.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 51/2000




Highlight

The cape market continues on its downward momentum with this time bunkers ( 
Fuel Oil ) helping the slide as they have lost approx. $30 in the last couple 
weeks and make the costs of running the ships significantly less.  Panamaxes 
have on the other hand, started a slow upward trend.  Most bundits think that 
this latest rise might be the 'dead cat bounce'.  The Japanese buyers and the 
US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks 
while arguing over 'starlink' which is basically genetically modified crops 
while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news 
of resumed shipping.  When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week, 
Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed, and the panamax market 
quickly reversed trend and starting going up.  

With the Christmas season quickly approaching, we expect the market to slow 
down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining 
positions quickly.   This is the last report in 2000.  Have a good holiday 
and see you next year !!!

I think we will see many exchanges with weather contracts in Europe next 
year. I've heard about 6 different ones so far.  One of the problems we will 
run into is that they all look into different way of setting up contracts.  
That can create a situation where we don't get anyone to concentrate about 
any "standard" solution.  By cooperating with them can we probably control 
the development, but we can also try to keep them in the "dark" so we get 
people to use EOL more.  I would tend to lean to the last option right now, 
and see how it goes

Thanks for the update.  I think it shows how starved for new products these 
exchanges are.  I'm not a fan of teaming up with these kinds of entities.  
It's unclear what they bring, and how does this help us?  what do you think?

We have had some meetings with the Helsinki Stock Exchange, and they are very 
eager to link to us on Weather.
What's your general opinion about linking EOL to other Exchanges when it 
comes to Weather contracts?

Subject: Weather: meeting with HEX

Meeting with the Helsinki Stock Exchange (HEX) went well and the future 
opportunities for both parties were discussed. They were very eager to list 
HDD swaps (and options at the Exchange) and this should be done by this 
coming spring. 

Below some bullet points from the meeting:

"deadline is spring
Enron as one of the market makers
They would need our help in formulating the product descriptions for the 
local authorities in Finland
They are looking at listing a few points in Finland to start with and then 
maybe adding other Nordic / European points 
They will provide clearing services for the products 
They will also market the products and give training to institutions as well 
as private investors/hedgers


Next steps:

They will contact other players regarding the weather derivatives. However, 
it seems that they see us as "the one" in this market and therefore would 
like us to help them out in the beginning. 

They will get back to us during this month to give us an update and outline 
the future process in more detail.

How do you feel about this? Are we interested in becoming a market maker? 
I feel that it would a great opportunity for us i.e. increased liquidity and 
they would do most of the marketing and training. They are also in a co-op 
with Eurex, which could open more doors for us in the continental market.


--------------
They have also to some extent investigated the possibility to list Real 
Estate derivatives at the Exchange. The way to do this would be to construct 
an index based on the closed deals in the real estate market. There could be 
separate indeces for the different part of the country or just one common 
one. Is this something we could do as well?? It would be a good instrument 
for institutions with large real estate portfolios as well as private 
investors (those saving for a house or the ones owning real estate).

Mr. Shankman,

I hope all is well with you. Currently I am a second year analyst faced with 
the dilemma of which career path to pursue.  Although there are several 
options, I'm primarily interested in developing a deeper understanding of 
Enron's market philosophy. Trading, risk management, and commodity 
structuring all sound interesting to me at this point, but I want to go into 
my next rotation with a clear sense of direction.

Brad Hitch, who I worked with over at Enron International, suggested I 
contact you to discuss your needs as well as new developments in your group.  
He thought you would be in an excellent position to assist me with my 
decision.

My resume' is attached for your consideration. As you will see, I have a 
significant amount of Investment Banking, and financial industry experience. 
I know how busy you must be during this time of year, but I would appreciate 
a few minutes of your time.

I shall call you during the week of November 14th to schedule a time for us

Subject: Offshore crude

Tom Byargeon, Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in 
the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana/Texas oil and gas drilling 
projects. This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure 
long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas 
trading desk activities. Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP 
program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than 
natural gas projects. 

They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which 
involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 
and #582. The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million 
barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd 
starting in 1Q 2003. Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 
API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur. Plans are to build a private pipeline to 
Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore. Peggy is 
finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore.

Tom's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude 
on either a fixed or floating basis. The floating could be tied to a Platt's 
index or the NYMEX. It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a 
physical or financial contract, but Tom hopes to get us first and/or last 
look from Murphy when the time is right. Another alternative is to give 
Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for 
the new production barrels. 

Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis 
differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003?

The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the=20
surface during
the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la=
st=20
week.
>From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati=
on=20
of
mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,=
=20
and a lack
of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market
somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than=

lower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem=

Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.

Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=
=20
expect
the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=
=20
market.
Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=

Bcf per day
of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return =

the gas
market should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil=

greater, as
distillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse=

supply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=

demand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n=

shutting
down production comes easily or cheaply.

Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=
s
justifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20
significant
settling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20
sustained in the
mid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).=
=20
More
luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=
=20
the gas
market.

Gas Storage--The Final Push
October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20
approximately 8.5
Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=
e=20
5.5
Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=
=20
injections
of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=
=20
futures
prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=
=20
October. With
the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20
slowing of
injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=
n=20
100
Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October.

CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record=
=20
low
inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=
er.
However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20
heating load
from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=
h CERA
estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=
=20
or even
substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20
inventories on a
trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=
=20
will
remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=
e=20
priced
out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=
=20
oil.
Regional Markets-Winter Rules

The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =
of=20
winter
heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=
ch
Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also
eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20
between
both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=
he
Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =
the
magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=
=20
of flows
on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=
r=20
(see
Table 3).

CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry
Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the
Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the
end of October and early November depending on heating load,
but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials
well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA
expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub
during November.

* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies
will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting
flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should
follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general
narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA
expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu
for November.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the
Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should
continue through November, with some slight widening in the
Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows
commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu
and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.

* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline
during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago
citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would
result from normal November weather this year would offset
most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials
will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when
Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector
Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA
expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per
MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial
rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,
but there is little added delivery capacity into that market.
CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub
during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain
The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20
uncertain. A
line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=
=20
200-300
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=
n=20
the
pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20
quantities of
gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=
s=20
precisely
the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =
is=20
on par
with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=
=20
2000,
approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20
shallow trend
does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =
to=20
produce
a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=
y=20
build is
expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=
=20
growth of
350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up
TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=
=20
accelerated;
eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=
nd of=20
October.
Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=
ed
storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20
levels.
PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=
er
Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=
d=20
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=
ed
western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=
=20
Canadian
demand.

High Prices, Wide Differentials
The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20
October.
For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=
ng=20
AECO
average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).

Thank you for expressing interest in investing in C.E. Unterberg, Towbin
Communications Fund, L.P. (COMM) whose portfolio manager is Amanda
Macklowe.
We have been conducting monthly openings since the fund's inception.

We will allow monthly contributions into the fund on December 1, 2000 and
January 1, 2001.  After that, subscriptions will be quarterly as per the
Limited Partnership Agreement.

To date we have raised $12 million.  Despite the challenging market we have
experienced over the past few months, COMM had returned approximately 4.2%
through the end of October.  November continues along this trend.

If you are interested, please respond to this e-mail or you may give me a
call at
(212) 389-8027.

We thank you for your attention and wish you a joyous upcoming holiday
season.

Subject: Re:  

it isn't dead, but things are moving slowly.

the deal was initiated and is still being headed by jarek astramovicz (sp?)  
head of the warsaw office.  he says he is getting the green light from 
sheriff to proceed, despite the potential headlines.  however, the lead 
finance/origination guy here in london, michael mills, has resigned.  i 
talked to paul chivers about the deal yesterday and he will take mills' spot 
temporarily.  

in the meantime the polish govt has also ruled that pkn (owners of other 
polish ref) will not be allowed to bid, as jarek predicted, and which puts us 
in a good position.

we have not done anything yet, because i did not want to start working on 
something that did not get official backing, and support from finance.
what we will need to do as soon as everybody has gotten over the 
ramifications, is put together the various curves (fob basis) for the main 
products for 3-5 years out (length of our potential put option).  so far our 
attitude is that we treat this as an export ref and we will deal with the 
products as such.  any money made from the internal market will be gravy.

if we get management sign-off, this deal has a high potential of happening, 
and we will be handed 25pct of a refinery, and probably control over the 
products execution and hedging.
will keep you posted.

Mr. Jeffrey Shankman
COO Enron Global Markets
Houston

Dear Mr. Shankman,

At the suggestion of my colleagues Michael Baker & Donna Armand, I am
just dropping you this email to introduce myself -- the Penn development
officer who covers the world!  I am not sure I can benefit you --
although particularly in Asia I do know an awful lot of people --
perhaps as much as you can benefit me -- for the same reason.

And there may be some Penn initiatives around the world -- such as
the Center for the Advanced Study of India, about which you do know --
that you might like to be aware of -- a major new collaboration in
the making in the Life Sciences with Singapore, for instance....
you never know when the network will help.

I'd certainly welcome knowing more about what you do as well.  Totally
by coincidence I am coming to Houston Sunday to see an alumna who is in
poor health.  I am sorry that it is over Yom Kippur -- otherwise, I
would have offered you a meal.  Perhaps we can do it another time,
Philadelphia, Houston, or Hong Kong!

Thanks for all you do for Penn.

Ed Resovsky.

Thanks for the thought.  We are trying to get more fund business already 
through Per in the NY office.  Do you have any funds you'd like to sign up.  
In terms of products, I was thinking more depth in products we feel 
comfortable managing.  Maybe different spreads/cracks, whatever.  You can 
control product launch, not the funds.  Can you give a some ideas of more/new 
products we trade or more/new products you'd like to get on eol.  What more 
products will your customers want?  

Jeff

Jeff,
One thought that will take some work with the credit department is to try and 
get more of the fund and small trading companies to do
their day trading with us.  I would think getting the small specs on our 
system would give us much greater daily deal flow.  On the oil
side, our main counterparties are the large speculative trading shops and 
this reflects that it is mainly proprietary traders that we
are attracting at this stage.  Not sure how realistic this is from a credit 
perspective but if we could create some type of margin account
for the smaller players, similiar to the futures exchange clearing houses,  
we might be able to significantly increase our volumes with 
the existing instruments that we are presently offering.

Would like to talk again this week - I plan to get to Houston/London in the 
beginning of January and want to consider a path to start thinking on now - 
if I do make a change (or it is forced on me).

By the bye, a former analyst of mine says that you all might enter the 
fertilizer business...I tried to get Houston to enter it a year and a half 
ago - we ran the correlations and had a global market study done (Chem 
Systems - An IBM company).  The corr that Grant ran between ammonia/urea to 
corn was high (like above 92% if I recall)...we looked at investing in a 
plant here in Argentina (obviously significant supply/demand mix of 
agriculture and fert products in Arg/Brazil) at that time and were analyzing 
a potential hedge - I killed it because it was not competitive let alone the 
lack of interest in Houston...The market is on the way up...as long as you 
stick to the base products - pure fert futures never made a go from what I 
was told...take care...

Please let me know when you are available...

Thanks,
jf

Subject: Re: mkt thoughs  

The most significant aspect of the syncrude production problem is the unique 
blending qualities of the sweet crude produced by the plant. The synthetic 
crude produced by this plant has no bottoms. All other crude oils have at 
least some bottoms, therefore the demand on the replacement blending barrel 
will be higher than the volume of barrels lost. With the plant production 
down approximately 3.5 to 4.0 millions barrels, the impact ultimately will be 
an increase of wti demand during the Oct. 15-nov 15  approaching 130,000 b/d. 
Given the tightness of light sweet crude oil in padd 2, I believe this is 
significant. I think it was the main reason for x/z strengthening and the 
recent strength in z/f may also be attributed to this recent supply 
disruption. Until there are additional sweet barrels arbed into padd 2 from 
padd 3, I think we will see strength in the prompt spreads.

Subject: LNG brochure revised draft

As you know, we are preparing a new LNG brochure that will be rolled out at 
the Gastech Conference in Houston mid November.  Many of you have submitted 
comments that are hopefullyincluded herein.  Attached is the latest draft of 
the brochure text.  Please review this very carefully and submit your 
comments to Henry Means/Zdenek Gerych by Tuesday noon.  

I have scanned this and have noted at least several typos and some 
numerical/statistical errors.  AG, please check in particular the DPC/Metgas 
stuff.

Henry/Z, the purpose of this brochure is to communicate that the market is 
changing and that Enron is leading the transformation of this industry.  
However, there is a negative tone in parts of this that is a slap in the face 
to the major oil companies and the government companies particularly in the 
Mid east and Far East.  I want to get all negatives out---anything that a 
supplier could read as an insult will come back to bite us.  The message 
should be bold but positive, with no implied insults.

I look forward to reading the next draft Tuesday evening

Hope you had a good trip back.

you of the meeting and (b) determine whether there was any outstanding 
litigation between XL and ENE due to the weather derivatives team.

All-

Pursuant to our meeting yesterday, regarding the captioned matter, I have 
prepared a brief summary of the general issues, which are likely to be of 
interest to EOL and may be discussed in the meeting today with Andy Zipper.

Please feel free to add any points that you deem appropriate.

1.  The Links:

A link from Envera's site to EOL will be created.  The link would only be to 
the home page of EOL.   There would be no effect upon normal EOL vetting 
procedures for counterparties.

A link from Envera's site to Deal Bench will be created.  Again the link 
would only be to the home page of Deal Bench.  The Envera member companies 
would be required to follow normal Deal Bench registration of participants, 
however, such parties during 1Q 2000, would be permitted to engage in two 
free transactions on Deal Bench, with a maximum of 25 such free transactions 
in total. Presently, it is still under consideration as to whether such 
access would be to the auction area, or the collaboration area, or some 
variation thereof.  The fees to be charged post 1Q 2000 are under 
consideration.

2.  Trades

On a case-by-case basis, with no preexisting commitment, EGM would consider 
requests from Envera customers to make trades on a contingent basis on EOL.  
In the event that such trade is considered promising, then such pricing would 
be posted on EOL.  This would be free for the first 12 months, but thereafter 
such service would be provided for a fee.

3.  Envera Membership and Enron Services as Consideration for Envera Equity

EGM would pay between $300-500k for the ability to utilize the Envera hub to 
do deals for the period of [one year].

Some portion of the fee may also be considered as payment for equity in 
Envera LLC.  The Enron services provided (points 1. and 2. above, as well as 
access to Enron risk management and utility outsourcing ) will also be 
considered as payment for some portion of the Envera LLC equity.  The total 
equity received, is anticipated to be around five percent and the 
capitalization of the company is believed to be around $50,000,000.  The 
breakdown for the consideration for the equity still needs to be reviewed 
from the accounting side.

4.  Board Seat Considerations

Discussion regarding Enron obtaining an Envera Board seat has been 
discussed.  The fiduciary risks need to be considered, as we may be 
restricted in competing with Envera, unless certain steps are taken.  For 
example, if Commodity Logic were to be considered a competitor to Envera, 
unless we had the specific right to compete we could be subject to suit by 
Envera.  These risks may be negated through negotiation.  

The upside here would be the ability to have access to executives of certain 
petrochemical companies who are also shareholders in Envera and have Board 
seats.  It is believed that this type of access would likely lead to more 
deals for EGM and potentially for other Enron entities.

Unrelated to the Board seat, other promotional activities relating to Enron's 
services are foreseen through activities at Trade Shows and other networking 
venues.

5.  Building Connectivity Between Envera and Enron

It will be necessary to consider what activities, from the technical side, 
would be undertaken by Envera and what activities would be undertaken by 
Enron, to achieve the stated objectives, i.e. linking.

6.  Press Release

Envera is likely to want to make a public statement regarding this 
transaction with Enron.  The restrictions on the scope of such announcement 
must be considered.

I hope this is helpful.

John

Hi, hope things are well.  I'd like to talk about LNG trading vessels  
(merchant).  Have you been  talking with Pierre about all of this activity.   
George Mclellan is concerned about the exmar contract, and wants Pierre more 
involved with the business.  What do you think of this idea?  What are some 
of your thoughts regarding this business.  

Jeff

Dear Mr. Shankman,
     I obtained your name from the Penn Alum Network.  Sorry if this email is 
a bit long.  I came across a listing for a position with Enron in NY and am 
highly interested in applying for it. But, I would like to ask your advice 
regarding the approach I should take.
     When I was an undergraduate at Penn (Wharton & CAS), I started my own 
fertilizer trading company.  With zero capital and zero contacts in the 
industry, I built up a company with $ 15 mil in revenues and clients all over 
the world.  I personally developed relationships with clients like ConAgra, 
Transammonia, Mitsui and numerous others in Latin America and Europe.  
     Six years ago, outside factors forced me to join my family business, 
which is in the entertainment industry.  Now, I am at a point where I can, 
and want, to return to what I originally did.  The Enron position describes 
the exact objectives I faced in developing my own company - selling to large 
commercial and industrial customers.  That is exactly what I did and did 
well.  But, I am afraid that if I send my resume to the Human Resource dept.  
they will overlook my early experience and will be confused why a Broadway 
producer is applying for the job.
     Do you happen to have any suggestions ?  Perhaps you might know someone 
in the New York office that I can meet with.  I am very interested in working 
for Enron and know that I posses the right skills.  I would greatly 
appreciate your advice.
Thank you,
Rina Kirshner

Hey, I'll be around this weekend, trying to get myself together.  I can't 
tell you how overwhelmed I've felt recently, and I think our conversation 
while I was awol (in NY for the day last weekend) really got to me.  I'll 
tell you this weekend about my meeting with my the shrink the other day.  
(The part where I'm NOT good at compartmentalizing).  I think that threw me 
for a loop too.  Oh, your message got to me this morn.  Please don't ever 
think you are bothering me.  I guess I'm a little less mature about my 
emotions than I thought.  (I know this is all personal, but email seems to be 
a little easier for me to communicate this to you right now).  I'm not sure 
that my home number is on yet, so the cell phone is where I'll be.  Thanks 
for checking up on me.

Jeff,
As you are aware, in Houston, there is a preferred distribution for the 
entire company.   That being said,  I am not involved in the  process for the 
Associates and Analysts in London.  We simply receive a copy of their 
results.  I am not sure how they are handling their process.  I suggest you 
contact John Sherriff, Drew Lynch or Sophie Kingsley in the London office.

Gentlemen,

Attached is a memo from Shane (he runs my group in London) describing how the 
London AA representative conducted the PRC process.  They ranked everyone 
ordinally then simply applied  the distribution and --- end of process.  This 
is a forced distribution and two of my people fell one rank.  As you both 
know, I have a problem with this and I think you should as well.

Gary,

The pre-ranking meeting was held on Friday. The analysts and Associates for 
our group were assessed with the Traders for the first time.
The process was that a piece of paper was handed out showing the number of 
analysts and associates for each different class i.e trading, origination, 
finance, tech support etc and the forced distribution of rankings that would 
be followed for each group (I will get a copy of the sheet and fax it to 
you). We were told to rank all the Analysts (then after the Associates) from 
top to bottom and these were fitted to the distribution according to the 
sheet we were given with no deviation from the distribution shown on the 
sheet. We were told the names of the categories meant nothing and were just 
groupings ie "Has Issues" did not mean this it just meant the bottom two or 
three people of the distribution.The electricity desks had already had 
pre-meetings in which they fitted their own people and they expected every 
other group to fit their people similiarly.

The three A&A people we have here in London were all allocated "Excellent" 
ratings prior to the meeting but due to forced ranking of people to the 
defined distribution two of these were moved down to "Strong".

I am sorry that I did not send this email on Monday.

Regards,
Shane

Subject: IMPORTANT: MetGas Equity Sale & SPA Disclosure

I am getting increasingly concerned about the MetGas equity sale and the pace 
at which it is proceeding.  We discussed this last week and I thought the 
consensus was to slow this process down and exclude partners who could impede 
our strategic global LNG interests -- for example Petronas and BP Amoco.   I 
now understand that we are making presentatations on the equity sale to 
potential investors next week in Singapore (BP, Petronas, CEPA, Mitsubishi, 
etc).   

I don't like the notion that we must disclose our TIGA to SPA to potential 
investors.  There are several aspects of that SPA which gives us strategic 
advantage over other competitors - for example the diversion clause of 0.5 
MMTA.  I like even less the thought that one of our partners will see the 
Master Supply Agreement (MSA) to MetGas.  Once a competitor sees the MSA they 
will have some insight on how to undermine our supply aggregation efforts and 
how Enron manages its Global LNG risk book.  This is a serious concern and we 
must ensure that it doesn't happen -- first by exclusion and then by 
negotiation (i.e. in the shareholders agreement we don't give investors with 
less than 10% equity the right to see contracts -- by the way Petronas does 
this routinely with its partners in MLNG TIGA).

Your thoughts??

Subject: EOL Average Deal Count as of 10-18-00

Notes for this Week's Report:

* The average daily number of Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen 
eleven-fold since September, from a daily average of 11 to an average-to-date 
for October of 121 trades per day. This upward trend has also been increasing 
significantly as Enron Metals has averaged better nearly 212 transactions per 
day on EOL for the last three trading days (16th, 17th and 18th of October).

* Average daily volumes for Austrian Power have dropped off considerably 
since September due to the inclusion last month of several very large OTC 
physical transactions, including a forward done with Slovenske Elektrarne 
A.S. which alone accounted for over 1,890,000 MWH.

* The average daily deal count and volumes for Swiss Power have returned to 
the levels seen prior to August.  Both the months of August and September 
included several very large OTC physical transactions which have not been 
seen so far this month.

* Average daily volumes for ENA - Canada East Gas have increased considerably 
since September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical 
transactions, including a forward done with the Westcourt Group, Inc. which 
alone accounted for over 33,167,715 MMBtu's.  At the same time, the average 
daily  deal count has decreased slightly.

* Average daily volumes for Central Gas have decreased considerably since 
September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical transactions, 
including three spot transactions done with the Trailblazer Pipeline Company 
and J. M. Huber Corporation.  Each of the three transactions alone accounted 
for over 140,630,000 MMBtu's.

Hi John--hope things are well.  I'd like to invite you to One Great Night, 
Nov  8. if you are free.  Last year was my first year, and I will admit, it 
is somewhat of a spectacle.  Fun with the right group of people though.  

Let me know if you are around!

Jeff

Hi Chris- thanks for getting on the horn with Harvard last week- because we 
know they are already long the spreads, we will have to work on them amending 
the position or putting more on longer term.

Below is feedback from another fund- Tudor, who we trade a lot with- same 
thing- we will have to work on other ideas.  I am getting a bit more 
comfortable with the flow of crude and appreciate your help on ideas.

These guys generally look at us as nat gas/ power only but are very willing 
to trade crude/ products- just need to build credibility.

Talk to you later,

Subject: BRENT/WTI spread


Dwight/Jason-

We have done some analysis on the Brent / WTI spread- we would recommend
buying WTI/ selling Brent for 2Q01 (as well as 02 and 03).

We looked back to 1995 to see how each 2Q of these years traded 1 year
prior to it being prompt.  The graph attached gives the raw data and the
word doc some risk/ reward analysis (1995 was a weird year).

(See attached file: Brent_TI Analysis.xls)(See attached file:
Brent_WTI-Trade.doc)

The spread is pretty constant at 1.25- 1.40 up until the contracts are
prompt- then the average is more like 1.80.  2000 was particularly striking
because of the gasoline shortage in the Mid West which put pressure on WTI
at Cushing (and in general kept cracks high)- we got out to 2.70.  We are
looking for a repeat this year.  The Arb has generally moved to 2.70
minimum (to bring Brent to Cushing) because of higher freight rates this
year- this looks to continue.

The spread has moved out the last few days as Dec Brent is getting tight
(due to UK tax affect)- now 1.52 at 1.57

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.
Rgds,
CA

Subject: LNG for Spain

Some follow up on friday's meeting:

We need to focus quickly on whether or not there is any deal to be done with 
Middle East suppliers that can contribute to Enron Europe's power project in 
Spain.

Our pending deal with Adgas to ship LNG on the Heogh Galleon could be a good 
fit however  the current volume being discussed (0.3 MMTA) is only a small 
portion of the 1.3 to 1.5 MMTA required for the project in years 03+ (minimum 
delivery would be 1.0 MMTA).  We should press ADGAS to see if they would 
commit to a higher volume.  We also need to determine what we believe is the 
most effective pricing structure for the ADGAS LNG purchase (both in terms of 
supply to our project in Spain, but also for potential diversions to Europe 
in 01/02) and for what term.  Based on our discussions on friday, it may be 
that a crude based purchase price may work the best.  We have discussed both 
Brent and NYMEX based pricing formulas with ADGAS.  Merritt, Eric, lets add 
that to the agenda for our monday morning meeting and get some price 
structuring done.

The structure of the ADGAS deal will be based on a U.S. delivery.  We will 
reserve the right to divert to any other market (except TEPCO).  We will 
likely have to share, in some way the shipping savings, if we divert to a 
non-U.S. terminal but I think we can keep any upside made on the indexed 
portion of the price for ourselves.

In addition we will be contacting OMAN LNG to determine their ability to 
provide quantities to augment the ADGAS supplies, as well as potential 
shipping options (Exmar?)  Obviously we need to consider shipping 
requirements for our Atlantic Basin projects (i.e. Elba Island) when thinking 
about shipping for Spain.  I would also like to look at how Elba could be 
used as part of a potential take or pay avoidance strategy for the Spain 
power plant.

I will try to keep everyone updated as the pieces come together.

Thanks

Here is the latest version of the presentation to banks.  I have incorporated

shipping slide on the EGM portion because it was duplicative).  Because this 
needs to be printed/bound by early tomorrow morning, I would ask that all 
changes to this presentation be given to me by no later than 3:30 london

The final presentation will have background graphics but i have removed them

Thank you.

you should consider assoc. to interview analysts.  I would also like to put

Subject: Wharton Recruiting

In preparation for upcoming interviews and other events, we'd like to get the 
Wharton Recruiting team together on Friday, October 13 at 1pm in 44C1.  It 
looks like this could be a huge year for Enron on campus because start-ups 
are no longer hiring MBAs by the dozen and investment banking is facing a lot 
of uncertainty as a result of all of the recently mergers.  To take advantage 
of this, we really want to get all of you involved in some aspect of 
recruiting, whether it be sitting on a conference panel, interviewing on 
campus or helping out here in Houston.  Please plan on attending the 
meeting.  If you can't make the meeting, please let me know what area of 
recruiting you are interested in participating in.  Our biggest need right 
now is for interviewers for on campus interviews on November 9 and 10.  We 
need 12 interviewers (Manager and above) for the 9th and 6 (VP and above) for 
the 10th.  

See you Friday,  

Michele Nezi Marvin
Manager

I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM.  
However, I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m., which is too 
late into the trading day.  Please let me know if there are resources you 
need, so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas.  

Thanks.

Subject: Euell Energy Issue

I have fielded two calls regarding the Euell Energy issue.  They are from 
Beth Evans at Platt's and Robert Givens at Bridge News.  They have both 
spoken with Renard Euell and asked for our side of the story.  Primary points 
made are as follows:

9/28 or 29 - Mr. Euell contacted Enron through an employee in another 
division of Enron
  - This contact was forwarded to John Nowlan through a second employee
9/29  - Nowlan contacted Mr. Euell and told him that if Euell receives part 
of the oil that Enron would talk to him about a possible deal
  - Euell said he felt he would win part (NOTE: This was said in response to 
Beth's comment that Euell claimed Enron contacted him with    apparent inside 
knowledge that Euell was going to win part of the bid.)
10/3 or 4 - Euell called us regarding the SPR oil he won
  - We asked for the particulars of his bid and he stated them to us
10/4  - Enron received from Euell a copy of his letter to the DOE
  - The details were different than Euell had told us, but conversations 
continued
10/5  - Enron faxed a draft Novation Agreement to Euell.  This was never 
executed.  In fact, it has never left draft form.
10/5 thru 9 - Various conversations with Euell
  - He claimed to be in conversations with Nigeria, Shell, Mobil, BP, 
Equilon, Koch and Phillips
10/10  - Enron spoke with Euell around noon and suggested he take another 
deal that Euell claimed to have
  - Euell called Enron around 4:30 pm...Enron reiterated belief that Euell 
should take the bid he claimed to have
  - Interestingly, Euell was in Houston supposedly having meetings with 
various companies, but never requested a meeting with Enron, nor    did he 
ever have a meeting with Enron

Both reporters, prior to their conversation with me, are convinced the guy is 
a flake.  And lay most of the blame for the SPR debacle on the back of the 
DOE.  Palmer plans to contact John Fialka at Wall Street Journal later 
today.  If you have any questions, call me at ext. 3-9053.

Eric

Subject: VaR on Long-dated deals

Per our conversation this morning, the graph below shows the combined VaR for 
the last 30 days on just the long-dated deals.  Unfortunately, there is some 
intra-day trading and long term strategic trading for Energy Trend and 
JBlock.  The Risk Management group have started breaking out intra-day 
trading for FGH  and PAN-NAT, and they are currently in the process of 
breaking-out Energy Trend and JBlock.   This process requires setting up new 
books and re-booking new deals.  However, the graph below should give you an 
idea of how much VaR these deals are eating up.  I will send an updated graph 
once all books are successfully setup.

I am assuming that Beth has gotten with you in regards to inviting the 
undergrads.  She is not able to pull together people for this event at this 
time and Le Bec Fin can not accommodate that many people.  So at this time it 
looks like the undergrads will do dinner at a later date.  If you need any 
additional information please call me.

Thank you,

Here are more details on the Finance Conference next Thursday and Friday, 
Dec.  7 & 8, in Philadelphia.  On Thursday night there is a cocktail 
reception for introduction of the panelists and networking with students.  It 
is from 7-10 at the Park Hyatt Bellevue (same hotel where we are staying).  
We have dinner reservations at 9pm to take the students who receive offers 
from us to dinner at Le Bec Fin.  On Friday the conference begins at 9am 
(breakfast/checkin is 8-9).  Your panel, Corporate Finance, is from 9-10:30.  
Other panelists are Riccardo Guglielmetti - Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Equity 
Capital, Brian Heese -  Merrill Lynch VP, Debt Capital Markets, Joel Van Duse 
- Bank of America Co-head Consumer Products and Retail Investment Banking and 
someone to be named from JP Morgan Chase.  Topics of discussion include the 
state of the industry and critical issues, the impact of technology on 
corporate finance, how capital markets and corporate finance interact with 
the rest of Enron and career paths and profiles of individuals choosing this 
sector.  For the last part I'll try to track down the career paths of a few 
people to talk about.  

I will be arriving in Philadelphia on Thursday afternoon.  We have already 
reserved a hotel room for you and will send you the confirmation 
information.  Will you be coming from Houston or Sao Paulo?

I look forward to meeting you next week.

any thoughts on why the funds have their smallest nat gas positions on in 
over a year?
margins too high, don't like the risk/reward, i guess are the two most 
obvious thoughts but
perhaps you have something more insightful.  I thought the momentum funds
would be longer at least in some of the deferred contracts.

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.
Nat

George, I just saw the updated 4Q earnings outlook, and saw Jupiter, and 
British energy off the sheet.  Is Jupiter off because of the Massey problems 
you mentioned today.  What about British energy....

A)   I hope you received the courier delivered envelope re:the Range Rover

B)   Would you think me rude if I were respectfully to ask to postpone our 
meet tomorrow -
   I do fully recognize the many requests for your time and trust this will 
not preclude me    chatting with you again shortly.

Hi guys.  

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the 
Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, 
and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside 
Wharton/Penn recruiting.  In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from 
Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons.  This 
program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost 
a lot of momentum over the last two years.

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't  in 
its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been 
addressing.  The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams 
are not lending support to the program.  I'd be very happy to spend a few 
minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my 
overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.  

You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has 
gotten me to my rope's end with the program.

Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.  

Jeff

fyi,

Hats off to Larry Gagliardi and the Unleaded desk. They have done another 
large crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 
2001. This trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second 
largest transaction conducted to date on EOL.

I'd like to leave out mention of our equity participation in the first and

Jeff:
I believe you are aware the MetGas project has been suspended indefinitely, 
primarily due to the negative impact and uncertainty caused by the problems 
Dabhol Power is currently experiencing.  Enron  has suspended work to close 
project financing and we have significantly reduced the MetGas staff.  The 
Team will focus on completing the acquisition of all major permits and 
clearances over the next few weeks.  The go forward plan is to either package 
MetGas "as is" and sell it off or use it as leverage in the negotiation of 
the DPC workout with the Indian government.  

I will be relocating from India back to Houston  in the near future.  In 
anticipation of this relocation I am exploring possible job opportunities 
within the Enron family of companies.  

I believe I can add value to your team's efforts in developing the LNG 
projects in both Venezuela and the Bahamas.  I have experience related to 
both projects and I can hit the ground running.   In addition, I bring prior 
ECT experience and success as a deal maker / originator, extensive experience 
in LNG including the development of production facilities, regasification and 
related harbour facilities and experience negotiating LNG Sale & Purchase 
Agreements as both a buyer or seller. Coupled to this experience is my 
knowledge of what it takes to structure assets and the pertinent commercial 
documents such that the asset can be project financed.  I am confident I can 
be of help and add value to your Western hemisphere LNG Team.

I would appreciate you taking the time to review my resume and keeping me in 
mind when looking to fill any current or future positions. 


Thanks...

Ranendra:  I have been asked to begin the visa process for the above 
individual, located in India.

I believe Mr. Shrivastava has been working as Assistant Manager with Enron 
since May 10, 1998.  If this is correct, we will be able to bring him into 
the US on an L1 intracompany visa under the Blanklet L for Enron.  

Can you please let me have an email address for him so that I can send him 
the required visa questionnaire to begin the process.

Many thanks

into their organizations.  Particularly Texaco, since they have two trading 
offices, one in Whit Plains, the other here.  This set up for them has never 
worked well, and I'd like to talk to some of the better Texaco traders, if 
there are any.  Jeff

FYI,  Ted Bland mentioned to me that not alot of people, manager and above, 
have signed up for this date.  He was unable to tell me who has/has not 
signed up, but I thought you may want to send out a reminder if this is 
something that is important to EGM and our recruiting goals.

As we move forward with our global LNG strategy, it is obvious that the best 
way to capture value for Enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this 
business unit.  This merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position 
management from a worldwide perspective.  Our ability to gather data and to 
show only one Enron face in the market is crucial to our success.  As 
important is one pricing desk.  Many of you know, Eric Groves in Houston is 
running our pricing desk, Larry Lawyer is working on all finance type 
business for us, and Jen Fraser is running our fundamentals group.  

To bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide LNG business, Mike and I 
wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention.  ALL LNG 
contacts, negotiations, and contracts, (physical, financial, buys, sales, 
etc.), with external counterparties must and will be managed through our 
commercial LNG group headed by Eric Gonzales, and Rick Bergsieker.  

It is crucial to manage market perspective, appearance, and informantion.  We 
all know how important each project (Metgas, and other initiatives in India) 
could be, but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our 
businesses.

Regards

Jeff

Jeff,

I apologize, because I realise that I had not introduced myself to you.  I 
work with John Ambler as Director for International Marketing and Public 
Relations.  The original release was drafted by Envera and since our PR 
department provides support for the Crude and Liquids Product group, as part 
of our PR responsibilities for EGM, it was sent to us to revise and run 
through the approval process.  The copy I sent to you is the revised version 
that we completed.  We now will send it through the Corp. PR approval 
process, which includes a review by Investor Relations.

Again, thank you for your kind cooperation.
Habiba

Rice, UT, Baylor, Texas A&M, OU, Florida, LSU and Univ. of Houston

November 11th (Associates)
Columbia, NYU Stern, UCLA, UVA (Darden), Cornell and Vanderbilt

Wellesley, overflow and re-schedules from previous Super Saturdays

If you don't have a preference. I would prefer that you do either November 
4th or 11th.  I think that would be most beneficial.  You are certainly 
welcome to do both but I didn't want to push my luck (smile). Please let me

Jeff,
To ensure that the business units are involved in the recruiting of top 
quality candidates I am requesting your assistance in the Super Saturday that 
is scheduled for either Saturday, November 4th, November 11th or December 
9th.  We would like for you to participate as follows:

Be the speaker at breakfast
Interview candidates 
Facilitate the decision making meeting

The breakfast is from 7:30 AM until 8:30 AM.  The speech would begin at 
approximately 8:00 AM and need not be more than 15 to 20 minutes.  You would 
interview approximately 4-6 candidates.  A vital part of the process is 
determining which candidates will receive offers to join the Program.  We 
would like for you to facilitate the decision making meeting.  The meeting 
will be held in 5C2 beginning at 1:30 PM. and conclude by 3:30 PM.  We will 
provide the administrative assistance.
Your assistance and input would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know 
as soon as possible of your availability.
Thanks in advance.

By the way thanks for the help you have provided with Penn at both the 
graduate and undergraduate level.  It is very much appreciated.

Charlene

Group. Since CALME is going through a reorganization, the analysts were told

Jeff - Jupiter is in doubt as a fourth quarter deal due to Massey's inability 
to focus on the deal.  They are still trying to solve their waste coal spill, 
and are working on the reverse spinoff from Fluor.  I talked with Don 
Blakenship today, and he says they are still trying to do the deal this 
quarter - I obviously have my doubts, and moved it to Q1.

British Energy is being pushed to Q1 as well.  BE has declared their option 
tons and are delaying deliveries under our existing contract through April.  
They are hoping to miss the current bullish market by waiting to begin 
serious negotiations until early next year.

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

Delainey

Please find below a summary of where we stand for the year.  AIG will not 
close this year.   Mike Beyer is in Kentucky today closing on the revised 
Panther deal with Cline.

Current Coal -            $15 mm
Current Emissions - $3 mm
New International -   $5 mm
New USA -                  $3 mm
Panther -                      $5 mm
Sempra -                     $24 mm

Total -                          $55 mm

Please note we will have to fight 2 - internal issues in early Jan.  The 
first is the  American Coal Co. senior note that has resided in Treasury the 
past year.  There is a $1.7 mm hit associated with the note.  Our position is 
that Treasury agreed to take the note a year ago and manage it.  Any lose is 
by definition theirs.  I will get with Joe Deffner on this.

The second issue is the $4 mm that John Lavorato owes us for taking the 
incorrectly marked emissions book.  ENA clearly owes us this money, I'll 
follow up with Lavorato to discuss.

Kevin McGowan will be in next week to ensure that all the deals are correctly 
booked.

George

Here are more details on the Finance Conference next Thursday and Friday, 
Dec.  7 & 8, in Philadelphia.  On Thursday night there is a cocktail 
reception for introduction of the panelists and networking with students.  It 
is from 7-10 at the Park Hyatt Bellevue (same hotel where we are staying).  
We have dinner reservations at 9pm to take the students who receive offers 
from us to dinner at Le Bec Fin.  On Friday the conference begins at 9am 
(breakfast/checkin is 8-9).  Your panel, Corporate Finance, is from 9-10:30.  
Other panelists are Riccardo Guglielmetti - Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Equity 
Capital, Brian Heese -  Merrill Lynch VP, Debt Capital Markets, Joel Van Duse 
- Bank of America Co-head Consumer Products and Retail Investment Banking and 
someone to be named from JP Morgan Chase.  Topics of discussion include the 
state of the industry and critical issues, the impact of technology on 
corporate finance, how capital markets and corporate finance interact with 
the rest of Enron and career paths and profiles of individuals choosing this 
sector.  For the last part I'll try to track down the career paths of a few 
people to talk about.  

I will be arriving in Philadelphia on Thursday afternoon.  We have already 
reserved a hotel room for you and will send you the confirmation 
information.  Will you be coming from Houston or Sao Paulo?

I look forward to meeting you next week.

Both Stuart Staley,and Dan Reck are being moved to $175k base each.  In 
looking across our vp. list, Mike and I felt like these are two of our top 
vp's, and we wanted to make an equity adjustment.  They are low at the vp 
level within ews.   

Thanks.  Jeff

A few weeks ago, we sent you a letter extending an invitation to a cocktail

We've not heard back from you as to whether or not you can attend either or 
both special events planned for the directors attending the Association of 
Art Museum Directors' meeting in Houston next week.

Could you please let me know as soon as possible if you plan to attend either

Mr. Shankman,

I apologize for any inconvenience, however I just found out that Mrs. Fastow 
was aware that you guys would be unavailable.  There is also an artist from 
Spain in attendance, therefore the meeting will still be held in your 
absence.  I am assuming meeting notes will be provided for you at a later 
date.

Highlight
Despite sharp movement in spot rates for both sectors week in general has 
been relatively quiet. Capes saw majority of strength in Pacific with Intra 
Pacific rates rising around $1800 since last week. Late surge in Japanese 
buying ahead of the close of their financial year is main reason attributed 
to this rise. Atlantic Capesize been pretty flat to marginally better, no 
exciting news. Outlook for coming week is that Far East strength will be 
maintained although pace definitely slowing. No change sentiment in Pacific.

Panamax has seen opposite effect, grain stems finally rolling from S America 
which has been the major driver of the Atlantic market, for March loaders. 
market was under impression that Pacific likely to come under downward 
pressure but once the demand has been strong enough epecially for modern 
tonnage and outlook for coming week is that reates are likely to maintain 
firmness. Atlantic expected continue run for next week.

Short term we have established small long for nearby Capes, but maintain 
overall perspective to sell forward curve on appreciable rallies. Panamax 
very similar approach.

Panamax we fixed timecharter tonnage to cover 14 / 26 Mch Dreyfus Ist 
nomination USG / Far East grain cargo. Have also taken option to extend 
period of vessel for short Trans-Pacific voyage if market maintains strength 
longer than we think.

With regards to the situation in Iraq, we have close contacts with Bayoil, 
who is the largest lifter to the US. They remain very bearish the market 
,though they are sold out on their november arrivals they have a lot of 
barrels available in december. They feel the Euro situation will be of small 
impact and they are seeing business as usual for november loading. As a side 
note they are normally right about the Iraqi situation but last year they did 
have vessels waiting at Mina al Bakr when the Iraqis cancelled loadings. I'll 
let you know if they change their tune.

Looks like they've got good participation from IBs.  The fact that they are 
having it at one of the most expensive places in the city leads me to believe 
that they are putting a lot of effort into strong attendance and putting 
together a good conference.  Of course that is also why sponsorship is so 
expensive.  Do you want me to take care of signing us up?  Jeff, any ideas 
for panelists?

Hi Michele

thanks for getting back to me with regards to the finance conference.
I am in the process of collecting the committed speaker list. Just
wanted to give you a flavor for kind of people that we are targeting.

The major committed sponsors so far are some of the top investment banks
(Chase, Merrill
Goldman, MSDW) and we are lining up the either heads of investment banking,
asset management or some well know research analysts from these firms to
adress the panelists and the conference attendees.

I will have specific names for you in a couple of days are we are still in
the
process of confirming speakers.

The conference will be at the Park Hyatt in Center City along with the
Bullish
on Finance reception the previous day.

This conference will be a good platform for Enron to talk about its unique
position in trading and can utilize the Sales and Trading panel to expose
the
students and the conference attendees to Enrons capabilities and the firm in
general.

I will provide you with more information in the coming days and I sincerely
hope
you will choose to sponsor one of the panels and have a strong presence at
the finance conference this year.

Hi John

Things are heating up for year end keeping us all pretty busy.  As we go 
forward in many of our businesses, it's clear several need fine tuning.  One 
of which is weather worldwide.  Mark Tawney and I have spent quite a bit of 
time during the last several weeks working on a plan for next year and 
forward.  We've come to the conclusion that it will be most effective to add 
a London operation that will allow for quick and beneficial marketer 
interaction, immediate scalability, and more portfolio diversification.  I 
would structure the business around the continent with someone managing that 
portion of the operation, and continue to have Thor manage Scandinavia.  Mark 
and I will get together to structure the London based group and keep you 
advised.  

Mark has some great ideas, and I'd like to talk to you about this rather than 
go on in an email.  I'll give you a ring first thing in the morning.  

Best--

Jeff

John Nowlan is concerned that this var number isn't right.  According to 
john, the group significantly reduced postions (on the whole).  What about 
the forward forward vol?  Have we looked at that?  My instinct is that 
something is not accurate with this var number today if you look at the 
resulting position as of Friday evening's postion report.  I'd like someone 
to be dedicated to the crude and products group full time who can help us 
with "what if" scenarios throughout the trading day, and who can work with 
Pavel on the crude desk on the forward forward vol issue.  Also, I'd like to 
isolate first gas holdings since that is taking up approx 2 million in var 
each day.

Hi Drew, hope the London digs are working out!  

I have a HR problem that we need to address immediately.  Today we let Britta 
Dinndahl go.  Her termination was a case study in how to screw up a 
termination.  She was let back onto the trading floor where she called and 
email people telling them about her termination.  I understand from Chris 
Mahoney that (neither Nigel nor) Yvonne Scoroer was ready to handle this 
today, even though they had been briefed many times about her upcoming 
termination.  It wasn't until early afternoon that I called Phillipe Bibi to 
tell him of her termination, when she was taken off system access.  

In addition Yvonne has had Erik Hansen's contract for over three weeks and 
has not produced paper for Erik to sign.  It was my hope to have him under 
contract before the bonus period.  Further Jen Fraser was trying to hire 
Andrew Hill as a new employee for the Fundamentals group in London, and on 
three occasions Yvonne told Jonny Palmer that she would get an offer letter 
to him "today".  It took three weeks.

Obviously these are extremely serious lapses, and I do not want Yvonne 
involved in any more Enron Global Markets.  Cindy and Shanna have done a 
heroic job for us in the U.S. and they have been extremely frustrated with 
their counterparts in London.

Thanks for addressing this issue.

Jeff

Subject: RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company

Mike/Jeff:  per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's 
plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could 
have on our LNG business.  The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up 
the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India 
from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions 
related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.  I don't know how much someone 
may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a 
relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling 
this terminal

We will discuss next week when we are in India.  Please advise if youhave any 
thoughts or suggestions

Subject: RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company  

Rick, we can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week. Metgas 
is the only company that has any access to DPC's terminal. As you know, DPC 
is owned today by Enron (65), MSEB (15), GE (10) and Bechtel (10). At year 
end, Enron's 65 will be split to Enron (50) and new investor (15). Any 
changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC, which is 
heavily influenced, but not controlled, by Enron.

The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA, and Enron has this through 
Metgas. Under the TARA, Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that 
Metgas delivers to DPC. In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of 
terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real 
value here. Today, Metgas is 100% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has 
control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under 
current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity 
position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with 
someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable 
with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG 
role, we should discuss ASAP.

AG -- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with 
Rick and Clay.

Wade

Bill/Wade:  I would like to understand how DPC/Metgas selldown will impact 
Enron's ability to control acces to the DPC LNG terminal.  If an LNG 
competitor buys in (e.g., Total or British Gas or Shell) could they block our 
acces to the terminal?

Clay,

As you know, we are selling portions of both Dabhol and Metgas.  For fuel 
supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.  They will have 
BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of 
Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way 
the the various voting procedures are designed.  I am not as familiar with 
the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to 
negotiated something there since it is still in development.  Also, there 
should be attractive commercial returns with each project.

I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria.  
If they are interested, we need to get them up to speed quickly.

Call me or let me know how you want to proceed on this.


Bill

Clay,
Thanks for the information on DPC. IPIC's current focus on India is to
identify investments with related crude, naphtha or gas supply needs which
could be filled by Adnoc or Adgas, with priority currently assigned to
Adnoc's naphtha. IPIC would also be looking for a commercial return, BOD
participation & strong minority shareholder protection. Does the DPC
opportunity fit this profile? If so IPIC could certainly look at it...

Best Regards

Dave Forbes

Jeff,
I met with you in the fall & mentioned that my son had applied early 
acceptance to Penn for undergraduate.  In the craze of year end closings, I 
neglected to let you know that he got accepted this past December.  He is 
very excited & I am excited that the stress level in our house over college 
apps is over!!!  In any event, I would like to take as active a role as 
possible on the Penn/Wharton recruiting team.  Please let me know how I can 
help.  Thanks!

Subject: Further to your report

Jeff:

If further conversations with our technical folks, they have a suggestion 
which I believe increases the flexibility of this report and a key question 
which helps determine the resources required to support it.

First the suggestion.  If the report is designed to run with a Start date and 
End date, you will be able to pick the reporting period.  For example a 
particular week, a calendar month, the latest four weeks, etc.  This would be 
in lieu of the more structured (hard coded) format in my e-mail of 
yesterday.  I recommend this option.

Second the question.  How far back in time do you want to query?   60 days?  
90 days?

There is an extensive data capture requirement to prepare this report.  Each 
product will be queried a minimum of 24 times each day to capture the time, 
bid price, bid volume, offer price, offer volume.  All of this data will need 
to be stored for as long as you want to be able to query.   By limiting the 
amount of time the data is kept, we can minimize the amount of data storage 
resources required to support this report.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

-Bob

No special consideration needed.  I just promised him that I would get it to

thanks.  are there any other companys that make a substitutable connector?  
Meaning, do they (Amp) have any competitors of any sort?  I appreciate the

The company that makes the connectors for the 12 pair cable is called "Amp".  
They make both the existing and the substitute connector.

Subject: marketing quote

i wanted to follow up on our earlier phone conversation regarding a marketing 
quote. i spoke with troy about the product he was looking for, a strip of 
flat price quotes for 7 months, and the reason for the time delay. in order 
to give an accurate fixed priced quote on a month by month basis i needed to 
update the merc quotes on each front to back for the 7 months. this was going 
to take approx 5 minutes, the time needed to get spreads from the floor, and 
this was the amt of time i told troy i needed. i also explained i could quote 
it as a strip package vs settle live.( i believe this all took place Friday.)

if memory serves me, early Monday the customer asked for the quote as a strip 
package. we quoted it live, but i don't believe they liked the offer. 
considering that i quoted the mkt on both the bid and ask, which was a good 
25-30pts tighter than the floor i am not sure what the problem was. as i see 
it, if they did not like the offer i provided they were free to take me out 
of the bid i showed them on the two way.

kind regards,

Phil Clifford

Good afternoon Jeff,

Cindy Olson referred me to you, suggesting that you would have the 
information mentioned below.  Enron University Affairs, Ken Lay, Jeff 
Skilling, Andy Fastow and Gene Humphrey have been working with Harvard 
Business School, specifically Chris Bartlett and Meg Wozny of Harvard, on a 
case study of Enron.  This study is in its last phase and the only 
'roadblock' is gathering additional information.  In particular, Harvard 
would like information on the 'size and growth of the risk management group'. 
 

This information will help facilitate drawing an effective comparison of the 
'old' Enron and the 'new' Enron.  

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,

Cindy Derecskey

Since only I know I'm not trying to offend you, that's all I can say.  I'm 
not sure I'm worthy of your being concerned either  (I don't deserve it--I'd 
guess)  You know, after we talked the other day, I felt better for a while.  
I don't know what to say, and I'm sure I'm embarrassed by this whole 
thing--most particularly how I've handled our relationship.  I really want to 
see you, but I need some time to myself I guess.  I do know glen doesn't have 
all the answers, but I find him to be impartial and helpful--really the only 
one these days.  My mother suggested a trip home this weekend, and i may go.  
I wish this were easy.....I think part of my issue is I've always felt our 
friendship is one I wanted to keep always, and I feel I tend to jeopardize 
friendships....

I'm so confused by you.

Sorry about your week.  Hopefully, since it's the weekend your week will
only get better, but as for my part in it, if any, I'm losing patience.
I don't know whether to be concerned about you or offended by you.  It's
increasingly difficult to be both.  Since you don't call as much as to
check in with me or respond to my calls, clearly you don't want to bother
with me and aren't particularly concerned whether I'm ok or not, and I have
to resist the urge to call and check on you because you are unresponsive
and seemingly untruthful, so I feel foolish even trying.  As a result, I'm
leaning more and more toward the offended/annoyed side.

Maybe Glen will have "all the answers" for you, but I don't think that's
possible and I think you just need to accept it and move forward.   It will
all pass and you will be fine in the long run.

but others) after our phone call is a result of the week.  I'm seeing Glen

Subject: pnl overnight loss of 6.7 mil for european distillates


some of this number is just due to the ipe gasoil mkt closing before the 
brent.

I will highlight what is coming back in and where the money is lost by doing 
an appx m-t-m where the mkt is at this moment.

ipegasoil  +1.4
physical gasoil      .90
heat      -.20
brent      -.30
dubai     - .50
pnl clawback      +1.3

we have been reducing the risk in the book on a daily basis as you can tell 
from the var changes.  I need to go thru
with the person who does our book in houston how he arrived at last night 
numbers.  the losses on physical gasoil
seem to great to me so hopefully the money coming back in will be greater 
than my above estimate.

ber 15, 2000




CERA Alert: December 15, 2000 

Title: Refined Products Line--North American Markets 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Refined Products 

US Margin Highlights 
* Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels, 
US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by $2.26 per barrel 
to average $1.45 per barrel during November. Gasoline margins have returned 
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at 
exceptionally high values. CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average 
$2.75 per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year, $1.16 per barrel 
lower than this year's first quarter average. 

* High sulfur No. 2 fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly, 
averaging $5.97 per barrel in November. Despite the drop of $0.37 per barrel 
from October's average, fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented 
values-$4.20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $3.46 per barrel greater 
that the previous five-year average. For the first quarter of 2001, CERA 
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record 
high level of $4.75 per barrel in the first quarter.

* Jet/kerosene differentials versus WTI rose $0.63 per barrel from the 
October average, reaching a whopping $8.59 per barrel in November. In 
correspondence with the distillate market, jet/kerosene margins are at 
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight 
fundamentals. CERA expects jet/kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the 
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the 
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of 
$5.75 per barrel.

* Margins for US Gulf Coast 1% sulfur residual fuel dropped by $2.15 per 
barrel, reaching $3.99 per barrel below WTI during November. Despite the 
recent widening of differentials, CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to 
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter 
months. Residual fuel differentials are expected to average $2.50 per barrel 
below WTI during the first quarter of next year, at the high end of the 
historical range.

US Demand Highlights 
* Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0.5 million 
barrels per day (mbd) from the October level, reaching 8.36 mbd for the four 
weeks ending December 8. Demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last 
year largely because Y2K concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago. 
CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder 
temperatures arrive, averaging 8.08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001.

* Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3.94 
mbd for the four weeks ending December 8, over 7 percent greater than this 
time last year. This represents a slight increase of about 0.05 million 
barrels (mb) from the end-October level of 3.90 mb, but still a record high 
level for early December. With support from low home heating oil inventories, 
particularly in the Northeast, distillate demand has been very strong during 
the fall of 2000. CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter 
months, averaging 3.79 mb during the first quarter of next year. 

* Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the October level 
to reach 1.68 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8. Despite the decline, 
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year-ago level. The 
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel 
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to 
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals. CERA expects the 
demand for jet fuel to average 1.81 mb during the fourth quarter. 

* Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0.87 mbd for the four weeks 
ending December 8, a decline of about 0.09 mbd from the October average and a 
slight increase over the November level. Demand for residual fuel is 
currently 11 percent greater than last year, and surging natural gas prices 
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout 
the winter. Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0.85 to 0.9 mbd 
range during the first quarter of 2001.

US Inventory Highlights 
* Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196.5 mb, increasing 
almost 10 mb from the end-October value. Responding to rising stock levels 
and declining apparent demand, forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to 
23.5 days for the four weeks ending December 8. Forward supply is 2.5 percent 
below last year's level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the 
past eight years-although CERA still believes coverage is currently 
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter. However, CERA is 
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and 
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the 
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year.

* Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of 
October at 29.2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. 
Despite record high apparent demand, strong refinery production levels helped 
boost primary distillate inventories slightly, to 115.3 mb for this period. 
Primary stocks are 16 percent below last year's level at this time and at 
their lowest historical level ever. Although stocks are low, CERA does not 
anticipate shortages to occur this winter. Assuming normally cold weather, 
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting 
demand requirements-albeit at a high price. 

* Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage, to 
reach 25.7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. This 
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23.5 to 25 days' supply range that it had 
been in for the past four months. The rise of just under 1 day in forward 
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand. Jet inventories 
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull 
from tight distillate markets strengthen, but supplies are expected to be 
adequate for the winter.

* Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply 
from October, reaching 41.7 days of forward supply during the four weeks 
ending December 8. The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a 
drop in demand and an increase in stocks. With demand expected to strengthen 
because of colder weather and high gas prices, CERA looks for inventories and 
coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 40/2000




Highlight
Relatively quiet week with Panamax rates drifting until Friday when rates 
seemed to stabilise.  In the cape market, rates continue to increase across 
the board with a rush of new cargoes being quoted in the market ( EDF trading 
leading the pack ).  Glencore and Anglo came into the market this week 
looking for 1 year freight rates into the UK for the BE tender with more 
mines expected to look for rates next week.  We had another visit from 
Bocimar this week as they wanted to meet the guys from MG to discuss hedging 
some of their freight exposure with aluminium which has a 75% correlation 
with the cape freight market.  Furthermore, they wanted to start trading coal 
in ARA and tanker freight which should be going live next week on EOL .

On the ABC front, we are hearing that they are in negotiations with Zodiac, 
another cape owner, but do not know the time frame of any potential deal.  We 
had this week a call from Coeclerici asking us if we were interested in 
joining forces in buying ABC so this makes a total of 4 companies having 
approached us asking to team up and as a result, we plan on exploring the 
potential of creating a consortium of buyers for ABC.

Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Down	Down	Down
Cape Size	Up	Up	Flat


Bunkers:  With events in the middle east and continued low stocks of Gasoline 
in the US, the Fuel Oil/Bunker market is rocketing upwards with an increase 
of $30 per ton in Rotterdam in 10 days.  Over the long term these crude 
prices should derail the world economy and the freigth market but in the 
short term this will continue to sustain the freight market

Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed a panamax for early November loading from Drummond to LBT at $9.80


Third parties freight deals
Sold 4 capes to Intercore from Puerto Bolivar to Ijmuiden + Amsterdam from 
April to October 2001. 


OTC 
FFA s
Bought 150,000 tons Bolivar/Rotterdam at $8.15 for Q4 2000 from Bocimar and 
bought a panamax for Q4 2000 and Q1 2001 from Andre
      
EOL
Launching a new route on EOL next week: US Gulf to Japan on Panamax

Travels
Pierre is back from Asia and Andy and myself are all in the office

One of the tranport dot coms has asked if we could post diesel hedges on 
their site.  I know we don't (maybe no one does) trade diesel.  But there is 
a huge a need for this product in the transport world.  Any thoughts on how 
to do this?

No problem about the book!  I'm sure it's a fun chew toy.  So it sounds like 
school is keeping you busy.  Let me know when you want to talk to my friend 
at Continental. 
I'm so tired from work--I'm going to watch a couple of movies tonight at 
home--the media room is all done with carpet, etc.  If you want to come over 
and watch movies and maybe eat that would be great.  Tomorrow I have friends 
in from out to town, a dinner on sunday for work, and I may be in London most 
of next week...

Thor,

A quick note.  I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather 
business plan.  I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while 
traveling overseas.  I read it again today and wanted to give you some 
feedback.  I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.  Thank 
you for all your effort. 

 I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3 
days, and I will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of 
our other businesses.  I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to 
discuss some of the ideas you presented. 

Mike

Jeff,

Last week we discussed looking at your cost of people in the Singapore 
office.  If you could check out the cost for lower-level manager types I 
would be most appreciative.  I have already discussed this with Lilian Low of 
HR Singapore so if this was your planned course of action I've already 
covered that base - she told me managers are about the same US$ amount as in 
Houston.

Thanks,

Bob

PS - That was a most evil joke you played on Lavorato......I enjoyed it 
immensely.

Hi Michele

I am writing to confirm that Enron will be participating in the
Sales/Trading
panel.

I have some great news. We have decided to give Enron the Sponsorship
spot for the Sales and Trading panel.


Key benifits of being a Panel Sponsor

- A big Enron Banner can be displayed indicating that you are the official
sponsor of the entire Sales/Trading panel
- Mention in the program guide and all other conference material
- In addition to the panelist spot on the Sales/Trading panel, Enron
gets to open the panel session with a 15-20min presentation on general
trends in the sales and trading industry, an excellent opportunity
for a senior person from Enron to address the audience.

Also for folks from Enron coming to the conference we have hotel rooms
blocked at a discount price at the Park Hyatt.

I will be getting you a lot of the details with regards to logistics for the
panel and Enrons participation in the conference in the coming weeks..

Once again, I would like to thank you for the sponsorship and presence at
The finance conference.

Looking forward to it..

Regards
Suresh Balasubramanian

Subject: MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE - You've Been Selected to Participate in an 
Interactive Panel

You have been selected to participate in an interactive panel at next week's 
Enron Management Conference.  The panel, which is scheduled to take place at 
10:30 a.m. on Friday, November 17, will be the last session of the conference 
and will last approximately an hour and fifteen minutes.

You don't have to do any significant preparation.  All I ask is that you 1.) 
review an article, 2.) give some thought to your experiences at Enron, and
3.) come willing to talk.  Peter Skarzynski, founder and CEO of Strategos, 
will moderate the panel.  With Gary Hamel as its chairman, Strategos is a 
leading innovation consulting company. Gary will be presenting at the 
conference on Thursday.  His presentation will revolve around his latest 
book, Leading the Revolution.  In it, Gary outlines ten rules for designing a 
culture that fosters innovation.  We will focus the panel discussion around 
seven of the ten rules:

Set Unreasonable Expectations
Stretch Your Business Definition
Design an Open Market for Ideas
Offer an Open Market for Capital
Open up the Market for Talent
Lower the Risks of Experimentation
Make Like a Cell - Divide and Divide

To familiarize yourself with these rules, I will be sending you a Fortune 
magazine article (June 12) that provides an overview.  (You'll notice that 
Enron is used as an example for several of the rules.)  During the course of 
discussion, you will be asked to talk about your own experiences with 
innovation within Enron.  In sharing examples of innovation, Peter will ask 
you to address the following questions:

How did you do it?  (Were one or more of the rules applied?)
What were the hurdles? 
Where did you stumble?
What, if anything, was surprising?

Outside of discussing specific examples of innovation, the discussion might 
also include conversation around how to maintain a focus on innovation while 
running the day to day business or how to spot a good idea.

You'll notice I referred to this as an interactive panel.  Another element to 
this panel will be audience participation.  At this year's conference, for 
the first time  we will be utilizing an electronic audience response system 
(ARS).  Through the ARS, presenters will be able to pose yes/no, true/false, 
or multiple choice questions to the audience.  During the course of the panel 
discussion, Peter will solicit feedback from the audience on certain topics.  
The audience will be able to respond to questions immediately by simply 
pressing a button on an electronic keypad.  Responses will be instantaneously 
recorded and graphically displayed on the screen.

I want your participation in this panel to be as easy and painless as 
possible.  I will not be scheduling any meetings to discuss this further.  I 
will merely ask that you forego the scheduled break at 10:15 a.m. on Friday, 
and come to the front of the meeting room to speak briefly with Peter and to 
be equipped with a microphone.  If you wish to speak with Peter prior to 
November 17, he has assured me that he will make himself available to talk 
with any of you.  I will be happy to arrange a call for you.

If you will not be at the conference and therefore not able to participate, 
please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can consider a 
replacement for you.  Feel free to contact me with any other additional 
questions or concerns.  

I'm looking forward to working with each of you on this endeavor,

SUMMARY

Atlantic

Over the last week we have really seen the consequences of the wet and warm 
winter in Europe with a total of some 1.7 million
tonnes being offered to us on the resell for delivery over the next couple of 
months. As a consequence spot/Q2 prices are now
trading at $2 discount to replacement from South Africa ($40.75 FOB ARA 
versus $42.75 replacement) - a concept which many are
struggling to get their head round. The Lion's share of the resell mkt is 
South African which makes sense as the strong U.S. mkt has 
taken what little slack there has been in the South American pipeline. In 
truth, while the U.S. mkt has been steaming, only very limited 
incremental tonnage from SAM has made it into the U.S. as the Utilities only 
pay up for spot spot material. If the steep backwardisation
in the U.S. rolls forward there may remain opportunities to bury spot SAM 
cargoes at high levels but one thing is for sure is that the
strong U.S domestic market will keep U.S. exports into Europe very low. 

Pacific

Very few Australian cargoes have found their way to the fair shores of Europe 
over the last few months and this has been a function of 
the strong Pacific market at the back end of 2000 and indeed in part due to 
the consolidation which has been going on, the latest 
development to be Rio Tinto's acquirement of Peabody's asset's in Oz. We are 
currently entering the period of negotiations between Oz 
producers and the JSM's for pricing of their long-term contracts. It is not a 
secret that the producer's plan to go for broke and are looking to 
lock in prices above $30 FOB Newcastle - currently wud call the mkt $28.50. 
JSM's are apparently holding tight citing world economic 
slowdown.  At $28 the oz producer is making some $13 a tonne, the chinese are 
due to export a further 6 million mt this year and steel 
production is forecast to be down some 10% year on year - while we may see 
some activity at higher prices in the short-term I think it 
will be difficult for the producers to realise the numbers which they are 
talking longer term. China is also talking prices of $30 which is
$3/4 higher than last year but have some $3 frt advantage versus Newcastle.

Gameplan

We are currently a total of 2.4 million mt short ARA (1 million API2 / 1.4 
million SECA) with the bulk being in back end of this year. We will
continue to sell the front end aggressively in the belief that the mkt has 
some further downside from where we are today - the mkt has merely 
sold off on rumour thus far but when these cargoes actually start arriving 
unsold into Europe there shud be some additional pressure on prices
if the stock situation does not improve in ARA - currently a 13 day lineup in 
Rotterdam. There are reports of Siberian type weather heading our
way which cud increase burn temporarily but I donot think this will have a 
significant impact. We are busy looking for any opportunity to sell
out of our South African long as Glencore tries to prop the mkt up and will 
then look to buy back our physical shorts into Europe from the
Armada of coal which is due to arrive. Psychology shud create downward 
pressure along the whole forward curve and we will be looking to 
buy in some our deferred short sub $30 RBCT equivalent. Meanwhile we are 
working to sell 3-5 year agreements with several utilities while
the mkt loiters in the higher regions of the historical range. We are also 
talking with several producers about securing longer term contracts 
which will give us a good supply base to work from going forward. In the 
Pacific we will look for an opportunity to cover our CLP short on the 
nearby but will look to the fundamentals to do their work bfor covering 
anything further forward.

as usual we were the first group in london to spot that the enron server in 
houston was having some problems and a big back log of messages (for good 
reasons as we were anxiously awaiting  an incoming message which never came 
on one of our ship which is in a delicate situation).
why on earth is it that we don t get a warning that there is a problem so 
that we can tell our customers, suppliers to use direct fax line s or other 
means of communications  . in this instance the long awaited message was 
worth 60 000 usd but could have been much more .

Let's sit down next week and go over this.  There are some other things going 
on that the LNG group is trying to trade with El Paso for LNG space around 
the country, as well.

Subject: SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL

Hey guys, no real need to read all of this. I just want to be sure your team 
and our team are closely coordinating on the Elba Island tolling agreements 
(your team) and gas sales agreements (our team). These discussions have been 
going on for about eight months now and I want to be sure this is all 
worthwhile. Phil Demoes is spending a considerable amount of time 
coordinating and negotiating with Southern Co. and other sales customers for 
the LNG offtake agreements. I'm assuming Doug Arnell is your lead on deciding 
and executing on the strategy at Elba. There is a CONSIDERABLE amount of 
money  to be made depending on your view of the long-term supply curve for 
LNG. 

Question: Are the right people involved here on both sides to develop and 
execute on the strategy at Elba? What is our specific strategy at Elba and 
can we accelerate our negotiations on the various contracts here? Please 
advise. Thanks.

Janet, Gil and Ed,

Please note Les' latest summary of Elba.  Things seem to be coming to a head 
there.  Southern Co. was in town last Thursday to visit us and Les agreed to 
start working on a letter of intent with Southern Co for the sale of gas from 
the terminal.   We have been asked to work up a good price for gas at Elba by 
Les.  I have started working with John Hodge and John Griffith on this.

So. Co.'s latest offer was Hub + $.12 for all 160,000 dt/d.  So. Co. wants 
100,000 dt/d at Elba and will give us the option of selling to them the 
remaining 60,000 dt/d at Elba or Destin at our option.  We have not discussed 
what a price at Destin should be.  So. Co. has some leverage with El Paso 
that can be instrumental in helping Les with his negotiations below.  
Additionally, they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and 
significantly improve the btu issue at Elba.

We should be better prepared to talk about this by Wednesday.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.

Subject: SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL

GREETINGS:

On November 17, 2000 Southern LNG advised the FERC that it "has determined to 
withdraw the Btu stabilization options from the instant certificate 
application", such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate 
issued by the FERC in March, 2000 authorizing Southern LNG to reactivate the 
LNG terminal at Elba Island.

With this withdrawal, the El Paso organization has drawn its line in the 
sand.  We plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the FERC within the 
15 day period allowed by FERC procedures.  This gives us until December 2, 
2000 to file which, presumably, would be extended until Monday, December 4, 
2000.

Our filing will be of an adversarial nature, so the Enron organization needs 
to be on board with our intended filing, which we will commence drafting on 
November 20, 2000.  Drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel, 
so please advise us re any additions in that regard.

At the same time, this decision by Southern LNG will focus our resolve to 
complete the commercial transaction with El Paso Merchant Energy.  We have 
come to accept some of the less desirable features of the Letter 
Agreement/Term Sheet signed with El Paso Merchant Energy on October 13, 1999, 
inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor, including 
several that Southern LNG found rather unsettling.  We will discuss the path 
forward with El Paso Merchant Energy on November 21-22, 2000.

While we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our 
commercial flexibility and optionality intact, we must be positioned to move 
forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both El Paso Merchant Energy 
and Southern LNG.  We cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss 
alternative solutions.


On Wednesday, November 15, 2000, we gave both Mike Varagona and David Jenkins 
of El Paso Merchant Energy a "heads-up" regarding our likely response to 
Southern LNG's proposed letter agreement dated November 1, 2000.  We 
indicated we would be asking Southern LNG to bifurcate the FERC proceeding 
into the Vaporizer Project, that could proceed quickly and on an independent 
path to certification, and the Stabilization Project, that required 
considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed.  When I 
contacted Mike Varagona on Friday, November 17, 2000, after we received a 
copy of Southern LNG's letter to the FERC, he stated that he had not been 
advised by Southern LNG regarding its decision, hence, had not been 
positioned to return the favor.

Mr. Varagona will be in Houston on November 21 and 22, and he wants to meet 
with us.  He is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees El Paso 
"take on the quality risk" in return for our firming up our volumes to El 
Paso Merchant Energy at an improved price of Henry Hub plus approx. $0.08 per 
MMBtu.  Let there be no doubt that El Paso and Southern LNG will find a 
solution to the quality issue at little or no cost.  He said he would like to 
prepare us an outline of an offer. to which I responded that he had nothing 
to lose by doing so.  The usual practice has been for Enron to do this and 
for El Paso to respond with "I don't think that will work".

Mr. Varagona also indicated that he did not see how the Letter Agreement/Term 
Sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our 
respective companies - "It just won't work!".  As a consequence, he stated 
that Clarke Smith, head of El Paso Merchant Energy, has already contacted or 
will shortly contact our Mike McConnell to see if they can work to resolve 
this matter. Apparently, these gentlemen have developed a good working 
relationship over the years.  He also alluded to the possibility that Mr. 
Smith may have also contacted our Stan Horton (for less than obvious reasons 
to me).  

Mr. Varagona further advised me that a Duke/Williams joint venture had just 
acquired the rights to the Gulfstream Pipeline Project from Coastal 
(divestment of this asset was required, I understand, as part of the El 
Paso/Coastal merger).  "This situation gives added impetus to development of 
the Cypress Pipeline project by Enron and El Paso."


There is considerable merit in Enron retaining the right to market its own 
gas out of the Elba Island LNG Terminal.  However, we may find it desirable 
to reach some commercial resolution with El Paso Merchant Energy for a 
portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear.  However, 
should we decide to so compromise, we must either fully engage Southern LNG 
in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement 
with El Paso.  In the case of Southern LNG, we are dealing with one or more 
individuals who see only one way to do things. namely their way, and who are 
totally opposed to working with Enron.  I would recommend any compromise with 
El Paso Merchant Energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with 
Southern LNG on explicit terms acceptable to us (and checking it twice).


I would appreciate receiving your comments, if any, before Thanksgiving.

Regards.
Les Webber

I've forward separate e-mails to each of you initiating both my interest to 
introduce myself for consideration to working within your respective groups, 
but also including some commercial ideas relative to the South American 
region and elsewhere.  

I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not, 
and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston.   

I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need, 
including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron.

Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf.

Gentlemen,

 The meeting today with our equity traders should be an informal discussion.  
My intention is to encourage you to get to know them, to educate you about 
how they run their separate businesses and to discuss future prospects of the 
fund.  Although we will be touching on some heavy topics, such as accepting 
third party money, the tone of the meeting should be relaxed, informative and 
a good debate.  I will be sending you a presentation shortly.

Thanks,

Gary

Sorry to hear that you won't be joining us. I will be sure to let Ben know
that you wanted to attend.  Please do me a favor - an obvious favor but one
that I will feel remiss if I do not ask...Please do not send him something
before tomorrow night as it is still a surprise. I only ask because you
mentioned that you would try to send him something tomorrow.  His actual
birthday is on the 22nd so he still has no idea.
Thank you and perhaps we can all get together on your next trip to NY.
Be well and have a happy holiday season.
Hillary
