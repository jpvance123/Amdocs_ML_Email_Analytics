Good Morning Jeff!
Contrary to popular belief, there are conversions that can be used, that will 
reasonably convert the various units of measure.  I took a moment to compile 
them into the attached spreadsheet.  Enjoy!

Quick question:  Most folks think in terms of MMcf.  I know there isn't a 
straighforward crossward from therms to MMcf, but do you folks have any rules 
of thumb about BTU content I could use to translate the therm numbers you 
sent into MMcf?  Thanks a lot.

Jeff

Based on the information below, I've taken the liberty to compile a 
spreadsheet of active California-specific commercial gas customers residing 
in the HP, STAT, and Altra databases.  Included in the data is contact 
information, expiration dates, product, price, LDC, volumes, as well as 
number of accounts.  Unfortunately STAT is the only database that allows 
reporting on rate class.  I've included that information.  As a rule of 
thumb, STAT generally houses the smaller commercial, HP, the medium 
commercial, with Altra holding the industrial customers. 

 I hope this helps, Jim

Thanks for the note, Dave.  Sounds at least modestly promising and consistent 
with Sempra's message that they "want to work to make the market better."  
Following up on our call last week, and just to ensure that we're not saying 
anything that gets cross-ways with anything you might be discussing with Ron 
and Nancy, give me a jingle when you get a chance and let's compare notes.  
In the past, Socalgas has done a good job of boring into the Company and 
having different discussions with different folks.

Also, Greg, if you have at your fingertips the profile of our California 
customer base by class in the aggregate---large industrial, commercial, small 
commercial & rez---that would be extremely useful info to have (i.e., how 
many, annual demand, average annual demand by class).  Finally, I'm assuming 
that turning back customers as a result of credit problems or lack of 
profitability is something we do on a consistent basis?  Thanks alot.

Best,
Jeff,

Many of these accounts are turned back to the utility because of credit 
issues or limited gas volumes make them unattractive. 

Catherine, how many of the 30 go back for other than credit or size? Please 
advise.

Subject: SoCal Cad Accounts

I had lunch today with Ron Kent and Nancy McVay from the Southern California 
Gas Company.  They are in charge of the Core Aggregation Transport program.  
Ron and Nancy have been tasked to encourage customers to switch from the 
utility.  I have been working with them to find ways in which they can 
promote the program with their customers.

They told me that we have been losing core customers back to the utility at a 
rate of 30 meters per month.  I asked them what they could do to help us hold 
on to these accounts.  They might be willing to give us a contact that we 
could have our customers who have decided to go back to the utility could 
call who would explain the benefits of being with a marketer and identify 
high prices as general market conditions.

I would have to make this request to them formally and would like to know if 
CAD would make use of this resource if the Gas Co. would agree to make it 
available.

Dave C.

This is SDG&E's facilitation proposal.  Comments are due tomorrow, 8/1.  The 
only thing that looks concerning to me is the attachment to the advise 
letter, page 4, paragraph f, which talks about an obligation to serve any 
customer within the designated group that is willing to post a 3-month 
security deposit.  As our group is now defined in the advice letter as 20 kW 
and above, we may want to either suggest further segmentation of the group or 
other criterion for our acceptance.

Subject: SDG&E AL 1242-E - Customer Choice Facilitation Program


Attached to this letter is an advice letter filed on behalf of SDG&E last
Thursday seeking authority to implement a "Customer Choice Facilitation
Program." The intent of this filing is to educate customers as to specific
electricity commodity procurement options that are available to them from
third parties which may help them better manage their energy costs, and to
make it easier for ESPs to make these options available to customers. A
brief description of this program is set forth below, but if you are
interested, we urge you to review the program details, which are set forth
in the attached advice letter.
As you will note, the proposed Customer Choice Facilitation Program will be
initiated by SDG&E notifying ESPs registered with the Commission as well as
ESPs with signed contracts with SDG&E of this program by informational
letter. This notification will be provided within approximately one week
after the filing of this Advice Letter to maximize the ability of ESPs to
qualify for participation in this program. Through this notification, ESPs
will be advised that, should this program be authorized by the Commission,
in order to participate they will need to: (1) demonstrate compliance with
the service establishment requirements of SDG&E electric Rule 25 (D)
including EDI compliance in the areas of DASR processing/consolidated
billing options, (2) agree to participate in the payment of program costs,
and (3) have a contract with a certified scheduling coordinator.
ESPs who desire to participate in the program will be required to send
written confirmation of their intent to participate and proof of compliance
with the participation criteria within four weeks after the informational
letter is mailed. At the end of the four week period, SDG&E will send to
participating ESPs a letter requesting that they: (1) describe in writing,
in reasonable detail, energy procurement or service offers they desire to
make to SDG&E customers, sign a program participation agreement, and pay
their share of program costs. ESPs will have two weeks to provide SDG&E with
the foregoing. SDG&E will then facilitate the compilation and communication
of these offers to customers through bill inserts for small customers and
direct mail to large commercial customers, supported by various types of
media advertising. Customer elections to switch energy procurement to ESPs,
and the switch itself, will be streamlined to the extent permissible without
compromising established consumer protections.
We hope that this program will be beneficial to both customers and ESPs that
offer customers attractive electricity procurement options. It is important
that customers be empowered to exercise control over their energy costs and
that ESPs have an opportunity to inform customers of the services they are
willing to offer.
If you have any questions concerning the advice letter or the program,
please do not hesitate to contact Dawn Osborne at 858 654-1275 or Lora Clay
at 858 654-1787.

Thanks Mike.? We shall make the additions you noted below.? SoCalGas (Eric 
Nelson) will be providing testimony on retail unbundling for the utilities. I 
agree with you that the mass- market retail parties should also include 
complementary testimony.? Although we discussed this earlier, I did not 
receive any firm commitments from the retail folks that they would sponsor 
such testimony - it may be an oversight on my part.? Nonetheless, retail 
testimony by those in the market should include a discussion of the benefits 
from Greenmountain.com, Utility.com, CUB, REMAC and the others.? Might I 
suggest that Enron, as a large mass-marketer itself, coordinate this effort 
with the other retail partners ? 

In addition, I want all settlement parties to look beyond testimony to the 
hearings, which are scheduled to begin in little more than a month.? We will 
need to make some time available during late May for practice panels 
(assuming we are granted panel hearings) and individual practice 
cross-examination.? At the same time, we also need to start thinking about 
direct cross-examination of the SCGC/TURN parties (again, assuming we decide 
to engage in full cross-examination of their settlement).? There is merit to 
cross-examination of the opposing settlement since it is not very well 
thought out, results in substantial cost-shifts, and is not consistent with 
the Commission's most promising options.? On the other hand, there is merit 
to limiting our cross, especially of Florio, who will use the witness box to 
grandstand.? It's something to think about.

Brian: 
? 
Thanks for your memo.? Let me add the following comments.? There should be a 
chapter on the retail settlement with the key parties listed.? Tom Beach and 
Vernon should be added to the chapter on impact on electric generators.? The 
Core Interstate Unbundling section where you list TXU and Shell was, I 
believe, originally supposed to include program benefits for the core 
aggregators as well, and you should add Enron to the list for that Chapter. 
Let me know if you concur with my recollection.? Thanks, Mike Day

Subject: May 5 Testimony Preparation GIR/NGS 

As you know, ALJ Biren has established May 5 as the date that testimony is 
due in support of all settlements filed on April 3 and April 17.? While she 
may offer additional guidance at the PHC on April 24, we need to start the 
process of formalizing the testimony supporting the Comprehensive Settlement 
Agreement.? 
? 
We have already identified the content and parties responsible for drafting 
the testimony (as identified below).? The testimony will be based on a "hub 
and spoke" approach, where SoCalGas will focus on the mechanics of 
unbundling, describing in detail how the capacity and retail unbundling 
process will work, with other parties filing testimony that complements 
SoCalGas' testimony while offering the parties individual perspective on why 
the settlement is in the public interest and benefits customers, the state 
of California, mom and apple pie - you get the picture.? In addition, I 
would like to suggest the following deadlines for getting testimony prepared 
and circulated so that all of the signatories to the settlement agreement 
have an opportunity to review and comment appropriately on the drafts.? I 
suggest we adhere to the following schedule: 
? 
April 25? Draft Outlines of Testimony? (Optional) 
April 28? 1st Draft Testimony 
May 2??? 2nd Draft Testimony 
May 5??? File Testimony w/Commission?????? 
? 
I think that it is essential that we circulate the draft testimony twice so 
that everyone knows what will be filed on the May 5.? The schedule is 
compressed, but we have to operate within the time parameters we've been 
given.?? The testimony assignments are identified below.? There has been one 
change from what we had agreed to previously.? SoCalGas will sponsor a 
witness on the "Concepts of Unbundling".? I would also like to suggest that 
we file the testimony a one comprehensive document.?? I have suggested a 
chapter-style format that might work, but I am open to suggestion.? Let me 
know what you think. 
? 
? 
Chapter 1??? SoCalGas??????????????????????? Concepts of Unbundling 

Chapter 2??? SoCalGas??????????????????????? Mechanics of Unbundling -

Gentlemen, 

Attached is my draft of several sections of Rick's testimony. Since we are 
moving here from an outline to prose, I thought that a "marked" copy showing 
changes would be more confusing than helpful. So my sections are in blue 
text, if you just want to read what I wrote. 

I leaned heavily on the outlines from Rick and from John Leslie, which I 
believe everyone will be able to do to save a lot of drafting time.

I look forward to receiving the other pieces, and comments or questions on my 
work, soon. 

The testimony has to be filed by Friday. John Leslie needs, I suspect, a full 
day to format, proof, print, and ship the document. So we have a real 
deadline of, say, noon on Thursday. If we want to give SoCal a peek, then we 
need to wrap this up by Wed. morning.

 I agree Michael, its good. My only suggestion is to add a bullet
collecting
 the benefits for the core aggregation program, suggesting that the
 unbundling of balancing and storage and interstate capacity,
combined with
 the billing credits will help make the program more economically
viable and
 revive the opportunity to offer competitive benefits to core
customers.

Baldwin reports as follows:

I spoke to Jerry Miller, PG&E, today concerning the unbundled CTA storage
option now being drafted in the PG&E tariff. Here is a summary of what we
reviewed.

Assuming that the tariffs are approved and operational by October 1st, CTA
customers will have the option to elect "Alternate Resources" as prescribed
in the documentation now being reviewed and avoid any future allocated
storage service cost. As the new rates will separate out these storage cost
components, both the market and would be suppliers of alternate resources
will be able to determine the future PG&E cost avoidance. Under the current
rules, CTAs are required to inject certain quantities of gas into storage
during the storage injection season. These gas volumes would be purchased by
the Core Procurement Group pursuant to the formula contained in Schedule
G-CFS. To the extent that the customers have paid for storage services in
their bundled transportation rates upto this October election, PG&E offers
this perspective. Residential customers , whom generally are not currently
participating in the CTA program, will not receive any compensation for
bundled paid to date storage service components prior to their election.
Commercial customers whom are participating in the CTA program will not
receive any compensation for bundle storage cost prior to their election.
However, Jerry suggest that this is not a real issue owing to the fact
commercial customers do not pay for storage services until the winter period
commencing November.

I  wanted to recap the discussions the settlement parties had regarding the  
preparation of testimony that is currently scheduled to be filed on May  5.?? 
The format will be based on the "hub and spoke" concept we  discussed 
earlier: SoCalGas will file testimony focusing on the mechanics of  capacity 
and retail unbundling, including a discussion of risk sharing,  illustrative 
rate impacts and evidence that the settlement is in the public  interest.? 
The other settlement parties will file?testimony from the  perspective on 
what the settlement means to their clients and why the settlement  is in the 
public interest.? Parties have also agreed to prepare  declarations for the 
settlement to be filed on April 17, drafts which must be  circulated prior to 
the 3PM conference call scheduled for Thursday  afternoon.? 
?
The  tentative assignment of testimony preparation responsibilities?are  
identified as follows:
?
SoCalGas????????????????????????Mechanics  of Capacity and Retail 
Unbundling?(separate?testimony for  capacity and retail)?
WGS/WHP/Enron???????????  Transmission, Storage and Balancing Unbundling 
Edison/Calpine/Dynegy?????Pricing  and Benefits to Electric Generators
Edison/Enron???????????????????Concepts  of Unbundling (Paul Carpenter as 
Industry Expert)
ORA???????????????????????????????  Unbundling Policy and Core Impacts
TXU/Shell?????????????????????????Core  Interstate Capacity Unbundling
Transwestern???????????????????  Primary and Secondary Receipt Point Access
Indicated  Producers??????????Open Season  and Impacts on California 
Production?
Calpine????????????????????????????Metering  Program?
?
The  parties also agreed that we need to counter the lobbying impacts of 
TURN/SCGC,  who have been making the rounds on the 5th floor and suggesting 
that industry  restructuring is no longer necessary and harms customers in 
southern  California.? If I have missed something, please let me know.? I 
would  also like to discuss with the parties on Thursday a schedule for 
review and  comment on the prepared testimonies.? I suggest that we try and 
get our  first drafts out no later than April 24.? Let me know what you  
think.
?
Mark  P.? - Please forward?Pat's e-mail so that I can add him to the  
distribution list
Craig  C. - Please forward Lindsay's e-mail so that I can add her to the 
distribution  list

Brian:

Thanks for your memo.  Let me add the following comments.  There should be a
chapter on the retail settlement with the key parties listed.  Tom Beach and
Vernon should be added to the chapter on impact on electric generators.  The
Core Interstate Unbundling section where you list TXU and Shell was, I
believe, originally supposed to include program benefits for the core
aggregators as well, and you should add Enron to the list for that Chapter.
Let me know if you concur with my recollection.  Thanks, Mike Day

the settlement is in the public interest and benefits customers, the state
of California, mom and apple pie - you get the picture.  In addition, I
would like to suggest the following deadlines for getting testimony prepared
and circulated so that all of the signatories to the settlement agreement
have an opportunity to review and comment appropriately on the drafts.  I
suggest we adhere to the following schedule:

April 25  Draft Outlines of Testimony  (Optional)
April 28  1st Draft Testimony
May 2    2nd Draft Testimony
May 5    File Testimony w/Commission

I think that it is essential that we circulate the draft testimony twice so
that everyone knows what will be filed on the May 5.  The schedule is
compressed, but we have to operate within the time parameters we've been
given.   The testimony assignments are identified below.  There has been one
change from what we had agreed to previously.  SoCalGas will sponsor a
witness on the "Concepts of Unbundling".  I would also like to suggest that
we file the testimony a one comprehensive document.   I have suggested a
chapter-style format that might work, but I am open to suggestion.  Let me
know what you think.


Chapter 1    SoCalGas                        Concepts of Unbundling

Chapter 2    SoCalGas                        Mechanics of Unbundling -
Capacity
Chapter 3    SoCalGas                        Mechanics of Unbundling -
Retail

Chapter 4    ORA                                Unbundling Policy and Core

Chapter 5    WGS/WHP/Enron            Transmission, Storage and Balancing
Chapter 6    Edison/Calpine/Dynegy     Pricing and Benefits to Electric

Jeff,
Sorry I've been hard to get a hold of... we held a workshop today to talk 
about our proposed Transport Options program.  I found a copy of what I'd 
sent to you before.  I'll stand behind these numbers today as representing 
the dollar value of the risk Transwestern faced in the proceeding.  What's 
not clear from my original note is that these cost impacts were annual, and 
such impacts would continue year to year thereafter until 
conditions/circumstances changed.  I hope this is useful.

Subject: GIR proceeding-- Potential Financial Impact to TW

Jeff,
You asked me to try to quantify the impact of Transwestern losing access 
rights to 200 MMcf/d of capacity at SoCal Needles as part of the GIR 
proceeding.  Unfortunately, it's not a precise science inasmuch as it depends 
on the shippers' reaction and/or retaliation to such circumstances.  As a 
baseline, Transwestern is almost fully subscribed under various term length 
contracts (and has been since 1998) to the California Border, including the 
750 MMcf/d of capacity available at SoCal Needles.  

In concept, under SFV rates, the majority of revenues would otherwise be 
realized by TW, notwithstanding the circumstance of TW shippers being denied 
full access to their primary delivery point.  In this "best case," the loss 
to TW would be the commodity rates (theoretically, a wash, since they 
presumably represent the true variable cost of TW providing the service), and 
the revenue benefit associated with the fuel margin, calculated to be $5.8MM.

If TW shippers took the position that TW was responsible, and therefore, 
accountable for their inability to consumate a portion of their transactions 
into SoCal Gas' system, then TW faces a "more onerous case" in which it loses 
the demand charge component of their contracts calculated to be $16.5MM.  
Coupled with the aforementioned fuel margin, the total loss is $22.3MM. 

In the worst case, in addition to the actual damages or costs to TW's 
shippers described above, TW shippers may face performance penalties or other 
contractual damages involving their commodity sales to customers behind SoCal 
Gas.  Therfore, TW shippers may attempt to extract those same penalties and 
costs from TW.

Realistically, I'd say that TW faces a loss somewhere between the best case 
and the more onerous case, maybe in the $12 - $15MM range.

I hope this information is useful for purposes of your analysis.  Let me know 
if I can be of any further assistance.

Jeff&Susan,

I just got off the phone with Rich Hall, Mr. PG&E, . It was all good news.
First, PG&E does not plan to file any rebuttal testimony. Secondly, Rich
indicated that their prep for the witness stand is to AVOID bringing Hector
Rd. into their position. Wheeler Ridge will be characterized as a unique
situation that requires further consideration. He acknowledged and
appreciated the work the Transwestern team has been putting forth trying to
at least give PG&E's requested settlement modification a fair and thoughtful
chance. Specifically, he understood and appreciated the "educational" effort
we have been expending with the Indicated Shippers. As to whom might file
rebuttal testimony to PG&E, like we assessed earlier, it is probably going
to be Kern. There is still an element in the PG&E camp that is advocating a
tougher position, but Rich is still successfully pulling them to our
preferred approach.


We will of course reassess the landscape after all the rebuttal testimony
has been filed, but so far the " seas are calm". I look forward to your
visit next week. You guys have a great weekend.

Mark, IGS

Attached below is the final version of the main settlement document.  I
believe we have resolved all issues we had discussed.  There are a few
additional minor changes in the text.

Also attached is a version that compares the current version to the version
sent out around 11 a.m. this morning.

It probably is not feasible to make any further changes today that would
require review by all parties.  -- Glen

To the Core Aggregator Group:

As you know, SoCalGas filed its formal gas industry restructuring settlement
agreement with the CPUC yesterday (April 17).  Over the past two weeks, the
core aggregator group worked extensively with SoCalGas and the other
settlement parties to make sure that the settlement language tracked the
agreed upon principles that were included in the "term sheet"  that was
filed with the CPUC on April 3.  Based upon my review of the document, I
believe that the settlement agreement fairly reflects the deal that we
reached with SoCalGas.

The CPUC's Presiding Judge in the case - - Andrea Biren - - has established
the procedural schedule for an evidentiary hearing in this proceeding.
Under this schedule, prepared direct testimony (in support of the
settlement) is due to be submitted by May 5.  Rebuttal testimony (opposing
the competing settlement that was filed by SCGC and TURN) is due to be
submitted by May 19.  The hearing will begin on May 30.

In discussions with SoCalGas and the other settlement parties, it was agreed
that all of the industry groups that have participated in the SoCalGas
settlement should present testimony in support of the settlement.  This
means that the core aggregator group (or individual members of the group)
should present one or more witnesses who can testify to the benefits that
the settlement will provide to the core aggregation program.  This effort
must commence immediately in order to achieve a May 5 deadline.

I believe that it would be efficient for the core aggregator group (SPURR,
REMAC, CUB, Greenmountain.com, utility.com, United Gas, Enron, TXU, Shell
Energy Services) to jointly sponsor a single witness to testify concerning
all the benefits of the settlement for the core aggregation program.  This
testimony would address the following features:

* Core interstate unbundling
* Core storage unbundling
* Unbundled (daily) balancing for core customers
* Unbundled core backbone transmission
* Avoided cost billing credits (and process to redetermine)
* Core brokerage fee (and process to reconsider role of utility's core
procurement department)
* Elimination of the cap on core customer participation in core
aggregation, and reduction of the threshold for core aggregation groups
* Elimination of core subscription gas sales option

If a witness is to be engaged by the group, this will need to be done very
soon.  In addition, if the group wants to have one attorney
representing the group, this also should be decided very soon.
Alternateively, individual core aggregators may prefer to proceed on their
own.

I estimate that the fees for an outside expert witness to testify on the
above-referenced matters would be approximately $9,900.  This
estimate is based upon an hourly rate of $180.00, and an estimate of 55
hours, as follows:

  Activity
Hours

 Draft prepared testimony and      25
 (possibly) rebuttal testimony

 Prepare for hearings, including      20
 responses to discovery requests
 and mock cross-examination

 Hearing time        10
 ________________________
_____

      TOTAL:        55
Hours


At $180 per hour, the expert witness fees would be $9,900.  This does not
include "costs".

Our group should discuss, at the earliest possible time, how to proceed with
the presentation of prepared testimony.  Please respond
promptly to this e-mail and provide your availability for a conference call
within the next two days to discuss this matter.

Thank you for your attention to his request.

- John Leslie

Attached for your review are copies of the settlement documents that were 
filed today in the Gas Industry Restructuring/Natural Gas Strategy 
proceeding, including the Motion for Approval of the Comprehensive Settlement 
that is supported by thirty signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement, the 
Comprehensive Settlement document itself, and the various appendices to the 
settlement.? Because a number of the declarations and signature pages are not 
yet available electronically, they have not been included with this note.? 
Hard copies of the Comprehensive Settlement, including all declarations and 
signature pages, are being shipped tonight via US mail to all parties on the 
service list.? Additional printed copies should be available within the next 
day or so and I will make them available to all of you - just let me know how 
many copies you need.

I would like to thank all of the parties who participated in this settlement 
process.? You have all devoted considerable time, resources and spirit in the 
preparation of this document - and it shows.? We now have a settlement before 
the Commission that includes ratepayer advocates, commercial and industrial 
customers, electric generators, marketers, shippers, independent storage 
providers,? gas suppliers,? producers, utilities, aggregators, pipeline 
companies, wholesale customers, municipalities, and retail mass marketers, 
among others.? 

While we should be proud of our accomplishment, we now must turn to the task 
of getting our testimony ready by May 5 deadline.? Assignments have already 
been made and I will schedule a conference call later this week to discuss 
related details.? So much for resting on our laurels.? Once again, thank you 
all for an outstanding accomplishment.

Jeff, 

I wanted to call attention to one of the new PG&E rate schedules (G-CFS) 
which Randy Litteneker distributed on Friday evening. 

The Assigned Storage Monthly Charge under G-CFS indicates the charge will 
become retroactively effective January 2000. How can PG&E implement a back 
charge of this nature? I believe these charges under this rate schedule 
should not commence until April 2000. The basis for my argument is as 
follows....

Proposed Schedule G-CT indicates that "In any storage year under this rate 
schedule, a CTA will be allowed one annual cycle for injection, inventory and 
withdrawal of gas in storage." While the typical storage year remains in 
effect, the charges would start in mid storage season when operational and 
economic decisions have already been completed. 
Proposed Schedule G-CT indicates that "Prior to March 1, each CTA will be 
given the option to reject a percentage of its initial Storage Allocation, up 
to 100 percent (%), for the upcoming storage year of April 1 through March 31 
(Storage Year)". This option was not given for the current storage year April 
2000 - March 2001. Further evidence in the current Schedule G-CT states that 
"PG&E will allocate to the CTA, acting on behalf of Customers in the Group, a 
pro rate share of of PG&E's total core storage capacity reservations." The 
current schedule makes no indication of ability to reject any allocated 
portion.

I apologize for continuing to harp on this issue but as stated in proposed 
G-CFS, I would incur charges of $506,700 (this is different from the $420,000 
I mentioned on the phone because I neglected to include the capacity we will 
receive from the PG&E Eneryg Services acquisition. This charge would 
obliterate the Gas Desk goals for 2000. 

Please call me to discuss when you have a chance. Thanks. 

Tim

Parties to the PG&E Gas OII Settlement:

On June 13th, PG&E held a workshop to discuss proposed tariffs to implement
the Comprehensive PG&E Gas OII Settlement Agreement.  At that meeting,
parties raised various issues concerning the draft tariffs we distributed on
May 25th.  Attached please find PG&E's proposed response to those issues,
other than metering issues which we will address next week.  In addition, we
have included changes to the non-metering draft tariffs from the version we
distributed on May 25th.

We encourage you to provide us with comments on these drafts by Friday, June
30, 2000.  We will host a half-day workshop on any unresolved issues on
Thursday, July 6, at 1:30 p.m., in Room 301b, 77 Beale Street, San
Francisco.

We will provide a response to the metering issues on Wednesday, June 28th,
and will host a half-day tariff workshop on these issues on Friday, June 30,
starting at 10:00 a.m., in Room 301b, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco.

Thanks for your help in finalizing these tariffs for our July 17 compliance
filing.

As you  know, ALJ Biren has established May 5 as the date that testimony is 
due in  support of all settlements filed on April 3 and April 17.? While she 
may  offer additional guidance at the PHC on April 24, we need to start the 
process  of formalizing the testimony supporting the Comprehensive 
Settlement  Agreement.? 
?
We  have already identified the content and parties responsible for drafting 
the  testimony (as identified below).? The testimony will be based on a  "hub 
and spoke" approach, where SoCalGas will focus on the mechanics  of 
unbundling, describing in detail how the capacity and retail unbundling  
process will work, with other parties filing testimony that complements  
SoCalGas' testimony while offering the parties individual perspective on why 
the  settlement is in the public interest and benefits customers, the state 
of  California, mom and apple pie - you get the picture.? In  addition, I 
would like to suggest the following deadlines for getting testimony  prepared 
and circulated so that all of the signatories to the settlement  agreement 
have an opportunity to review and comment appropriately on the  drafts.? I 
suggest we adhere to the following schedule:
?
April  25? Draft Outlines of Testimony? (Optional)
April 28? 1st Draft Testimony
May 2??? 2nd Draft  Testimony
May  5??? File Testimony  w/Commission?????? 
?
I  think that it is essential that we circulate the draft testimony twice so 
that  everyone knows what will be filed on the May 5.? The schedule is  
compressed, but we have to operate within the time parameters we've been  
given.?? The testimony assignments are identified  below.? There has been one 
change from what we had agreed to  previously.? SoCalGas will sponsor a 
witness on the "Concepts of  Unbundling".? I would also like to suggest that 
we file the testimony  a one comprehensive document.?? I have suggested a 
chapter-style  format that might work, but I am open to suggestion.? Let me 
know what you  think.
?
?
Chapter 1???  SoCalGas???????????????????????  Concepts of  
Unbundling???????????????????????????????????????  
Chapter 2???  SoCalGas???????????????????????  Mechanics of Unbundling -  
Capacity???????????????????????  
Chapter 3???  SoCalGas???????????????????????  Mechanics of Unbundling - 
Retail

Chapter 4???  ORA???????????????????????????????  Unbundling Policy and Core

                         IN SUPPORT OF
            THE COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

     My name is R. Thomas Beach. I am principal consultant with the firm=20
Crossborder
Energy. My business address is 2560 Ninth Street, Suite 316, Berkeley,=20
California 94710.  My
experience and qualifications are described in Attachment RTB-1 to the dire=
ct=20
testimony that I
served in this proceeding on May 4, 2000.


I.   INTRODUCTION

     This rebuttal testimony responds to the direct testimony of the Southe=
rn=20
California
Generation Coalition (SCGC) and The Utility Reform Network (TURN) in suppor=
t=20
of their "Post-
Interim Settlement Agreement" (PISA), which was submitted to the Commission=
=20
on April 3,
2000.  The sponsors of this rebuttal testimony include past, present, and=
=20
future electric generation
customers of the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) and San Diego G=
as=20
and Electric
(SDG&E).  The sponsors of this testimony are all signatories to and=20
supporters of the
Comprehensive Settlement Agreement that over 20 parties filed on April 17,=
=20
2000.  For the
reasons set forth below, the sponsors of this testimony do not support the=
=20
SCGC / TURN PISA
to the extent that it fails to unbundle intrastate transmission, a step tha=
t=20
is one of "the most
promising options" that the Commission has identified for the restructuring=
=20
of the SoCalGas
system.  I recommend, instead, that the Commission adopt the Comprehensive=
=20
Settlement
Agreement, which moves forward on all of the Commission's "most promising=
=20
options," including
unbundling intrastate transmission.  The Comprehensive Settlement Agreement=
=20
enjoys broad
support from the full range of stakeholder interests in the southern=20
California gas market.


II.  SCGC / TURN EXAGGERATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PG&E
     AND SOCALGAS SYSTEMS.

     In D. 99-07-015, at page 14, the Commission identified the creation of=
 a=20
system of firm,
tradeable intrastate transmission rights as one of its "most promising=20
options" for the further
restructuring of the SoCalGas system.  A significant element in that=20
determination was the
Commission's desire to follow the model of the PG&E Gas Accord, and thus to=
=20
encourage
statewide consistency in its gas restructuring program.  The SCGC / TURN PI=
SA=20
now asks the
Commission to re-consider that finding, and to defer any further unbundling=
=20
of intrastate
transmission service on the SoCalGas system.  In support of that aspect of=
=20
the PISA, the
witnesses for SCGC / TURN testify (1) that the unbundled transmission syste=
m=20
adopted for
PG&E under the Gas Accord responded to a unique set of problems that have n=
ot=20
been present in
southern California, (2) that there are significant structural and=20
operational differences between
the PG&E and SoCalGas systems, and (3) that the Gas Accord structure has no=
t=20
benefitted end-
use customers in northern California.  None of these assertions are correct=
.

     A.   The Commission Should Focus on a Statewide, Consistent Structure=
=20
for the
          Gas Utilities Moving Forward, Not on Whether PG&E and SoCalGas Ha=
ve
          Had Similar Problems in the Past.

     SCGC / TURN witness Mr. Florio describes at length the problems that l=
ed=20
to the
adoption on transmission unbundling for PG&E in the Gas Accord settlement. =
=20
He views PG&E's
difficulties as far more extensive than those that SoCalGas now faces, thus=
=20
justifying more
"extreme measures" such as the unbundling of intrastate transmission.  SCGC=
 /=20
TURN Testimony,
at Section 2.1.1.2.

     In my view, both PG&E and SoCalGas have faced the same types of=20
problems, even if the
economic distortions on the PG&E system have been greater.  On both systems=
,=20
shippers have not
had a system of firm capacity rights, allocated by non-discriminatory, open=
=20
access procedures, to
govern who had access to what receipt point.  On the PG&E system, the attem=
pt=20
to discriminate
against PGT Expansion volumes that sought to use PG&E's Line 400 resulted i=
n=20
the "crossover"
problems at Malin.  Similarly, SoCalGas' "windowing" procedures have not=20
provided firm, non-
discriminatory access at SoCalGas' receipt points.  "Windowing" has=20
restricted the access of
competitive gas supplies to receipt points such as Wheeler Ridge, just as t=
he=20
"crossover ban"
limited the competition to sell gas at Malin onto PG&E's Line 400.

     Furthermore, SoCalGas has also faced the same sort of "conflict of=20
interest" charges as
PG&E.  SoCalGas' core procurement department has been criticized for=20
monopolizing the Hector
Road receipt point, to the benefit of SoCalGas' shareholders through the Ga=
s=20
Cost Incentive
Mechanism.  See D. 99-07-015, at pages 15 - 18.

     However, the Commission should not decide the future structure for=20
California's gas
industry on the basis of whether SoCalGas' past problems have resembled=20
PG&E's past
difficulties. For electric generators, what is important is that the=20
structures that the Commission
adopts in both parts of the state should solve these problems and should be=
=20
consistent on a
statewide basis.  The new electric market is a statewide market.  There are=
=20
already at least two
merchant electric generators (Dynegy and Duke) and a number of QF projects=
=20
under common
ownership that operate in more than one gas utility service territory. =20
Another merchant plant
developer (Calpine) has made no secret of its intent to operate plants=20
statewide.  This trend
promises to increase competition in the electric market.  To encourage this=
=20
trend, the Commission
should focus on carrying through on D. 99-07-015's promise to increase the=
=20
statewide consistency
of California's natural gas restructuring program.  The unbundling of=20
intrastate transmission was a
key element of the PG&E Gas Accord, and should be a foundation of the furth=
er=20
restructuring of
the SoCalGas system, as well.

     B.   SoCalGas' Backbone System Serves the Same Function as PG&E's, and=
=20
Can
          Be Unbundled in a Manner Similar to the PG&E Gas Accord.

     Mr. Florio claims that the "network" nature of the SoCalGas system=20
argues against
following the Gas Accord model for unbundling backbone transmission service=
=20
for SoCalGas.
Yet Mr. Florio concedes that SoCalGas' mainline facilities that extend from=
=20
the Los Angeles basin
to the interstate pipelines on the California / Arizona border do resemble=
=20
interstate pipelines.
SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.1.1.3. SoCalGas' lines running north from the L.A=
.=20
Basin to the
Wheeler Ridge interconnects also are clearly backbone facilities similar to=
=20
PG&E's.  With respect
to local transmission, SoCalGas' network of local transmission lines inside=
=20
the L.A. Basin is
similar to PG&E's network of local transmission lines in its load centers i=
n=20
the Bay Area and
Central Valley.  Indeed, both the PG&E and SoCalGas systems can be consider=
ed=20
to be "spokes"
of backbone lines transporting gas from the interstate pipeline receipt=20
points to "hubs" of
networked local transmission facilities.  The two systems differ in the=20
length and number of the
"spokes" (SoCalGas' are shorter and more numerous), but operationally these=
=20
components serve
the same function.  In my view, there is just as strong an operational basi=
s=20
for unbundling
SoCalGas' backbone and local transmission facilities and services as there=
=20
was for unbundling
PG&E's.

     C.   The Benefits of the Gas Accord's City-Gate Market Have Been=20
Substantial
          for Electric Generators.

     Mr. Weil downplays the benefits that the Gas Accord has produced throu=
gh=20
competition
among suppliers in the PG&E city-gate market that the Gas Accord created. =
=20
First, he appears to
cite the existing data as showing "average benefits of around 2 cents or mo=
re=20
per MMcf/d."
SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.2. As cited in my direct testimony, the actual=
=20
benefits have been
more than 2 cents per mmcf/d   $0.03 to $0.08 per Dth.  Mr. Weil opines tha=
t=20
such savings are
not significant for core customers.  Ibid., at Section 2.2.2. Regardless of=
=20
whether one agrees with
him, such competitive reductions in transportation costs are very important=
=20
for electric
generators, whose total transportation rate is likely to be roughly $0.35 p=
er=20
Dth, and who, as Ms.
Yap states, "sell into a highly competitive PX market."  SCGC / TURN, at=20
Section 2.4.1. For an
electric generator, a 10 to 20% reduction in gas transportation charges is=
=20
well worth pursuing, as
shown by SCGC's active participation on SoCalGas BCAP issues that would low=
er=20
SoCalGas'
EG rates by far smaller amounts.

     D.   Customers Have Not Had to Hold Capacity or Pay Demand Charges to
          Realize These Benefits.

     Mr. Weil also asserts that the fact that relatively few end use=20
customers hold backbone
transmission capacity on the PG&E system shows that unbundling under the Ga=
s=20
Accord has not
benefitted customers.  He opines that this is due to the high transaction=
=20
costs associated with
holding capacity.  SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.3. Ms. Yap also describes at=
=20
length how the
transaction costs associated with managing transmission capacity tends to=
=20
force end users to buy
from marketers.  Ibid., Section 2.3.1. She concludes that unbundling has be=
en=20
"great for
marketers" but "not good for customers."  Ibid., at Section 2.3.1.

     This testimony ignores the fact that marketers do not exist independen=
t=20
of their customers.
If a marketer's services do not add value for the customer, then that=20
marketer will not remain in
business for long. Under the Gas Accord, most noncore end users in northern=
=20
California have
been buying gas from marketers in the PG&E city-gate market.  However, the=
=20
available data on
PG&E city-gate gas prices   discussed above   show that end users have=20
realized significant
savings from these purchases, compared to the option of buying gas at the=
=20
California border and
managing their own transportation to the city-gate.  These city-gate=20
purchases have not involved
paying demand charges or incurring transaction costs associated with managi=
ng=20
capacity.
Competition among marketers has assured that customers benefit from=20
marketers' efficiencies in
managing transportation costs.



III. SCGC'S AND TURN'S COST / BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF TRANSMISSION
     UNBUNDLING IGNORES THE BENEFITS AND OVERSTATES THE COSTS.

     SCGC and TURN attempt to present a cost / benefit analysis of=20
transmission unbundling,
largely through the testimony of Ms. Yap, in an effort to show that the cos=
ts=20
outweigh the
benefits.  Ms. Yap ignores several significant benefits from unbundling,=20
greatly exaggerates the
possible costs, and presents unsubstantiated assertions about the impacts o=
f=20
unbundling on
generators in the Los Angeles basin.

     A.   SCGC / TURN Fail to Recognize the Benefits of Transmission=20
Unbundling.

          1.   Unbundling will provide competitive benefits in the city-gat=
e=20
market.

     The experience with transmission unbundling under the PG&E Gas Accord =
has
demonstrated that end use customers realize competitive benefits from the=
=20
creation of a city-gate
market.  The city-gate market moves gas-to-gas competition between supplier=
s=20
closer to the
customer, and allows the customer to avoid risks associated with paying=20
demand charges or
managing backbone transportation. Those customers who believe they can=20
achieve greater profits
by managing their own transportation have that option, and since not all=20
transportation rights on
the PG&E system are held by marketers, it is obvious that such customers do=
=20
exist.

     Mr. Weil doubts that the city-gate benefits seen on the PG&E system wi=
ll=20
materialize, due
to "Southwest supply dominance" at SoCalGas receipt points.  SCGC / TURN, a=
t=20
Section 2.2.2. Presumably this refers to the fact that gas prices tend to=
=20
trade within a narrow range of a few
cents per Dth at all of the receipt points into the SoCalGas system.  Ibid.=
,=20
at Section 2.3.1. The
price differentials at the SoCalGas receipt points are much lower than the=
=20
significant price
differentials that have existed between Topock, Arizona, and Malin, Oregon,=
=20
the two major
receipt points into the PG&E system.  However, recently the Malin / Topock=
=20
price difference has
been due almost entirely to the $0.10 to $0.12 per Dth transportation rate=
=20
differential between
PG&E's Redwood and Baja paths.  Over the most recent year for which data is=
=20
available, Malin
prices have been essentially equivalent to Topock prices, when adjusted for=
=20
the downstream
transportation rate differences.  This integration of the Malin and Topock=
=20
markets has been the
result of rising Canadian prices relative to U.S. markets, which has produc=
ed=20
a competitive
equilibrium between Canadian and domestic supplies serving northern=20
California.  Yet over this
year the benefits of PG&E city-gate purchases has actually increased, even=
=20
though there was very
little difference between Malin and Topock prices delivered to the end user=
. =20
>From May 1999
through April 2000, PG&E city-gate prices have been $0.05 per Dth to $0.11=
=20
per Dth lower than
the comparable cost of border purchases plus PG&E's full backbone=20
transportation rates.  This
data is summarized in my Table 1.  Contrary to the SCGC / TURN testimony,=
=20
this recent
experience suggests that the price benefits from competition at a new=20
SoCalGas city-gate may be
just as large as those actually observed on the PG&E system.

              2.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces rates for EG=20
customers.

          Transmission unbundling, as proposed in the Comprehensive=20
Settlement, will result in a
modest reduction in transportation rates for electric generators.  My direc=
t=20
testimony discussed
how transmission unbundling under the Comprehensive Settlement will reduce =
EG=20
rates by $3
million per year in 2002, or about $0.01 per Dth, compared to the SoCalGas=
=20
rates adopted in the
recent BCAP decision, D. 00-04-060.  In addition, the Comprehensive=20
Settlement unbundles
transmission rates on an embedded cost basis, removing roughly half of the =
EG=20
rate from
SoCalGas' complex, contentious long-run marginal cost rate design.  This wi=
ll=20
enhance the
certainty and stability of SoCalGas' EG rate   a particularly important=20
factor to EG customers
that may seek to build new gas-fired capacity on the SoCalGas system.

              3.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces risks for EG=20
customers.

          Ms. Yap comments at length on how "if a generator's fundamental=
=20
risk increases, investors
demand more net income from the operation to compensate them for that=20
increased level of risk."
SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.3.  In my view, the Comprehensive Settlement=20
reduces a number
of important risks for electric generators, compared to the SCGC / TURN PIS=
A,=20
as follows:

=0F0         SoCalGas shareholders will assume 100% risk for the recovery o=
f=20
unbundled backbone
          transmission costs.  This protects electric generation customers=
=20
from bearing higher
          backbone transmission costs if SoCalGas discounts backbone rates =
or=20
if declining
          throughput leads to reduced backbone transmission revenues.

=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement prices transmission services on a=
n=20
embedded cost basis
          through August, 2006.  This removes the calculation and allocatio=
n=20
of marginal transmission
          costs as an issue in the next SoCalGas BCAP case.

=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement uses a defined 79% load factor to=
=20
price backbone
          transmission service through the term of the settlement.  This=20
removes the risk that declining
          throughput on the SoCalGas system could raise backbone transmissi=
on=20
rates in the next
          SoCalGas BCAP case.

=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement reduces customers' risk for reven=
ues=20
from unbundled
          storage services to 25% in the second year (beginning in April,=
=20
2002), while the SCGC /
          TURN PISA maintains the 50% risk adopted in D. 00-04-060 through=
=20
2002.

=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement unbundles SoCalGas' transmission,=
=20
storage, and balancing
          services.  This will offer electric generators a number of new=20
opportunities to reduce their
          costs, including (1) city-gate gas purchases, (2) self-balancing =
or=20
competitive balancing
          services, and (3) new, competitive storage services.  In my=20
opinion, these opportunities
          reduce the risk that generators in the Los Angeles Basin will be=
=20
caught in a "price squeeze"
          between their gas costs and their electric revenues, because they=
=20
will have more ways in
          which to reduce their gas costs.

          B.  SCGC / TURN Greatly Overstate the Impact of Demand Charges.

          The use of demand charges for backbone transmission service appea=
rs=20
to be the focal point
of SCGC / TURN's opposition to transmission unbundling.  Throughout their=
=20
testimony, SCGC /
TURN overstate the impact of demand charges:

=0F0         Ms. Yap's Figure 1, showing the impact of a customer's load fa=
ctor=20
on its average
          transportation rate, assumes that the customer's entire rate is=
=20
collected in a demand charge.
          SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.1. She fails to note that the demand=
=20
charge for firm backbone
          transmission under the Comprehensive Settlement will be only abou=
t=20
22% of the total EG
          rate under the SFV rate option, and just 12% of the rate under th=
e=20
alternative backbone rate
          with a 50% demand component.

=0F0         Ms. Yap presents the results of "a study of more than half of =
the=20
generators in the Los
          Angeles basin" that purports to show that "SFV-style" demand=20
charges could increase
          annual fixed costs by "as much as 20 percent."  SCGC / TURN, at=
=20
Section 2.4.2. I have
          examined the workpapers for this study, obtained in by Southern=
=20
California Edison in
          discovery, and it is based on wholly unrealistic assumptions for=
=20
how generators will buy gas
          under the Comprehensive Settlement.  First, the study assumes tha=
t=20
each generator will
          contract at the SFV rate proposed in the Comprehensive Settlement=
=20
for a quantity of firm
          backbone capacity based on the generator's theoretical maximum ga=
s=20
use in a day (that
          is, its generating capacity in MW, times its average heat rate,=
=20
times 24 hours).  Apparently,
          this assumption is made regardless of whether the plant has=20
actually ever used that much gas
          in a single day.  The plants studied are mostly intermediate-load=
=20
or peaking units, and almost
          certainly never operate at anything approaching full capacity for=
=20
all 24 hours of a day.  As a
          result of this assumption, the plants studied are assumed to=20
contract for 1,426 MDth per day
          of backbone capacity.  According to the study, these units=20
represent 43% (i.e. less than one-
          half) of the gas-fired capacity in the Los Angeles Basin.  If all=
=20
generators in the basin
          contracted for capacity in this way, electric generators alone=20
would demand 3,316 MDth per
          day of capacity, or 93% of SoCalGas' total receipt point capacity=
! =20
There is obviously no
          such demand today for firm service to electric generators on the=
=20
SoCalGas system.  Second,
          the study assumes that the generators will make no effort to=20
broker, release, or sell the
          massive amount of excess capacity that they have bought and will=
=20
derive no revenues from
          such off-peak capacity sales.

          Thus, the study's dire picture of the impact of demand charges on=
=20
low-load factor
     generators assumes that such generators massively over-contract for=20
capacity, and fail to
     take advantage of the numerous means available under the Comprehensive=
=20
Settlement to
     reduce or eliminate their demand charge risks:

          The Comprehensive Settlement offers an optional backbone rate wit=
h=20
a 50% demand
          charge that almost halves the demand charge risk, but offers the=
=20
same firm priority as the
          SFV demand charge.

          Under the comprehensive settlement, interruptible service at=20
volumetric rates is always
          available at no more than a 20% premium over firm backbone rates,=
=20
and may even be
          available at less than the firm backbone rates, particularly duri=
ng=20
low-demand periods.
          With a backbone rate of $0.0719 per Dth, this premium is no more=
=20
than $0.0144 per Dth.
          Ms. Yap observes (in Section 2.3.1) that the interstate pipelines=
=20
supplying SoCalGas have
          at least 1,000 MMcf/d (or 30%) more capacity than SoCalGas'=20
intrastate system.  She
          does not recognize that SoCalGas' backbone system also has more=
=20
than 900 MMcf/d of
          excess capacity, plus substantial excess storage capacity.  Due t=
o=20
this excess intrastate
          capacity, it is difficult to imagine a scenario, for the=20
foreseeable future, in which a low-
          load factor generator would ever have to pay more than the maximu=
m=20
interruptible rate
          for "virtually firm" backbone service.

          I have re-calculated the results of the SCGC / TURN study, under=
=20
the assumption that
          generators in the Los Angeles basin take interruptible service, i=
n=20
order to avoid demand
          charges, at the full $0.0144 per Dth premium for interruptible=20
service.  In this case, the
          generators' annual fixed costs increase by just six-tenths of one=
=20
percent (0.6%).  In
          reality, I expect that interruptible or released firm service wil=
l=20
be available for much of the
          year at all-volumetric rates that are much less than the maximum=
=20
interruptible rate.

          The Comprehensive Settlement will establish an active market for=
=20
the trading of
          backbone capacity on the SoCalGas system.  This will provide a=20
means for electric
          generators to rationalize their holdings of intrastate capacity,=
=20
and may be a source of firm
          capacity at volumetric rates.  Again, the SCGC / TURN study of th=
e=20
impact of demand
          charges assumes that generators do not use this secondary market.

          Ms. Yap fails to recognize that low-load factor generators will b=
e=20
able to avoid paying
          demand charges (and save money on intrastate transportation, as=
=20
well) by buying gas in
          the city-gate market.  Ms. Yap's primary concern with the city-ga=
te=20
market appears to
          be the fear that marketers will be able to charge a significant=
=20
premium for city-gate sales
          during periods of capacity constraints.  SCGC / TURN, at Section=
=20
2.3.1. Ms. Yap's
          testimony fails to explain her assertion that the city-gate marke=
t=20
could become a
          "bottleneck" on the SoCalGas system.  Upstream of the city-gate=
=20
market, SoCalGas will
          have over 900 MMcf/d of excess backbone capacity, plus significan=
t=20
amounts of unused
          storage capacity.

          Ms. Yap's "bottlenecks" and marketer-manipulated high prices have=
=20
not materialized in
          two years' of experience with the PG&E city-gate market, even=20
though PG&E has less
          excess transmission capacity and far less storage capacity than=
=20
SoCalGas.   PG&E city-
          gate prices did experience one brief spike, due to very high dema=
nd=20
during the cold snap
          just prior to Christmas in 1998, but on average PG&E city-gate=20
prices have provided
          significant benefits to end users, compared to purchases at the=
=20
California border.  In
          addition, the data that Mr. Weil cites on the parties holding=20
capacity on the PG&E system
          shows that 75 parties hold capacity on the Redwood path alone, an=
d=20
does not suggest any
          undue concentration of capacity holdings on the PG&E backbone=20
system.  Ibid., Table 1,
          Section 2.2.3.

          Furthermore, the Comprehensive Settlement has numerous provisions=
=20
to ensure that any
          one marketer will be unlikely to accumulate a dominant share of=
=20
capacity to the SoCalGas
          city-gate market.  First, noncore end use customers will have the=
=20
initial two open seasons
          in which to subscribe to up to 50% of the available backbone=20
capacity, without
          competition from marketers.  This should ensure that end users th=
at=20
are interested in
          holding capacity will be able to acquire the capacity that they=
=20
desire, and is likely to lead
          to an even greater number of holders of capacity than resulted fr=
om=20
the Gas Accord open
          season, in which end users and marketers competed together. =20
Second, the Comprehensive
          Settlement limits any one party from holding, at the end of the=
=20
open season process, more
          than 40% of the intrastate capacity from any individual SoCalGas=
=20
receipt point.  Third, if
          any party attempts to withhold firm intrastate capacity, in an=20
effort to drive up prices, that
          capacity will be available for SoCalGas to sell as interruptible=
=20
service, and SoCalGas will
          have a strong incentive to market such capacity, because it is 10=
0%=20
at risk for the
          recovery of backbone transmission costs.

     The SCGC / TURN testimony tries to portray low-load factor generators =
as=20
caught in a
"price squeeze" between capped PX prices and increased fixed operating cost=
s=20
due to the
imposition of demand charges for intrastate transmission.  SCGC / TURN,=20
Section 2.4.3.  The
testimony paints a grim picture of plants closing, and jobs lost, in the Lo=
s=20
Angeles Basin.
However, there are a number of elements in this picture that simply do not=
=20
add up:

=0F0    The testimony appears to assume that low-load factor generators pay=
 the=20
SFV demand
     charges, and take none of the steps discussed above to mitigate or=20
eliminate the impact of
     demand charges.

=0F0    The testimony does not recognize that there will be a $3 million do=
llar=20
reduction in rates to
     the EG class as a result of the Comprehensive Settlement.

=0F0    The testimony asserts that the increases in operating costs as a re=
sult=20
of demand charges will
     be serious enough to force plants to close.  Even accepting SCGC /=20
TURN's inflated figure
     of a 20% increase in fixed costs, SCGC / TURN provide no financial dat=
a=20
that substantiates
     their assertion that an increase of this magnitude is likely to force =
a=20
significant number of
     plants to close.

=0F0    SCGC / TURN fail to appreciate the logical way to avoid the "price=
=20
squeeze" that they so
     fear: buy gas in the SoCalGas city-gate market.  City-gate buyers will=
=20
avoid paying demand
     charges, so their fixed operating costs will not increase.  In additio=
n,=20
the SoCalGas city-gate
     market is likely to be the gas market that is most tightly linked to=
=20
electric prices in southern
     California, because it will be the closest market to the generators'=
=20
point of consumption and
     because almost 60% of noncore loads on the SoCalGas / SDG&E system are=
=20
electric
     generators.  As a result, generators buying gas in the SoCalGas=20
city-gate market will have
     the highest assurance that changes in their gas costs will be reflecte=
d=20
in changes in electric
     prices, thus reducing the risk of a "price squeeze between gas and=20
electric prices.  This has
     certainly been the case in northern California.  Straightforward=20
statistical analyses that I have
     performed show that the PG&E city-gate gas price is more highly=20
correlated to PX electric
     prices than are gas prices in any other market in the state, presumabl=
y=20
because electric
     generators in northern California use that market and because it is th=
e=20
closest market to the
     generators' burner tips.

=0F0    SCGC / TURN attempt to argue that the closure of low-load factor pl=
ants=20
in the Los
     Angeles Basin, due to the imposition of demand charges, will have=20
serious implications for
     electric reliability.  SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.5. At the same time=
,=20
SCGC / TURN argue
     that generators will not be able to recover demand charges because les=
s=20
than 20% of the
     capacity in the basin is under Reliability Must-Run (RMR) contracts an=
d=20
that there is
     "intense competition" for available RMR contracts.  Yet the lack of RM=
R=20
contracts in the
     basin is due to the fact that there is enough capacity in the basin to=
=20
provide more-than-
     adequate reliability and to assure that few generators can exercise=20
local market power.  If
     some generators in the Los Angeles Basin go out of business due to=20
demand charges, a more
     likely scenario than blackouts is that PX prices will rise in southern=
=20
California, the ISO will
     make available more RMR contracts in the basin, and those contracts wi=
ll=20
provide a higher
     level of cost recovery, thus offsetting the impact of the demand charg=
es.

     This completes my rebuttal testimony.

Subject:??????? Suggestions to improve SMEPRA core aggregation program 

Nancy, 

Per our conversation, I will ask Alethea Imperial of our office to hand this 
out at the meeting on Wednesday, since I will not be able to attend:

Customer migration to transport-only service will occur in significant 
numbers, and the benefits of a competitive commodity market will accrue, only 
if (a) the Utility Distribution Company exits the merchant function (as in 
California noncore, Atlanta Gas & Light examples), or (b) non-regulated 
suppliers have a realistic opportunity to "beat" the UDC price. 

Over time, as customers migrate from bundled service, the emphasis on beating 
the UDC price will fade (as it has in telecom), and end-users will actually 
get a lower price, as the competitive suppliers' risk premiums associated 
with targeting the price of a specific dominant competitor (the UDC) is 
removed from prices.

Examples of methods to beat the price include: 

shopping credits (as in New Jersey);
regulatory actions (as in the temporary price advantage due to core 
interstate unbundling if the SoCal Gas Comprehensive Settlement is approved); 
or
UDC monthly commodity price includes all actual retail-related costs 
calculated on an account-average basis, such as billing, customer service, 
marketing, etc., without reliance on economies of scale due to UDC 
performance of transportation function. Currently, the UDC prices tend to 
give wholesale, rather than retail, price signals and costs remain covered in 
local transportation rates. 

Suggestions for SEMPRA in this regard include: 

Include the current "pipeline credit" ($0.0282 /MMBtu) as a component of the 
posted core procurement rate, rather than as a deduction from local 
transportation rates.
Establish a well-publicized fund to be paid to those who switch to transport 
service on a first-come, first-serve basis. (This is John Leslie's 
"prime-the-pump-and-get-good-publicity-for-the-UDC" suggestion.) 
Commit to pricing for a 6 to 24 month period to be expressed as NGI SoCal 
CityGate plus or minus, so long as it is computed to include all retail, 
fully-delivered cost components. 
Compute core procurement price to send retail price signal, either by 
re-allocation of costs, by actual separation of procurement function to a 
separate, regulated utility under the SEMPRA umbrella, or by outsourcing 
procurement function to third party(ies).
Post a (projected or actual) "standard offer" price in advance for a 6 to 24 
month period, so long as it is computed to include all retail, 
fully-delivered cost components. 
Make a clear policy statement that SEMPRA wishes to exit the merchant 
function, even if only at some date to be determined in the future. 
To help educate consumers, all SEMPRA invoices should show core procurement 
price as applied to prorated therms consumed during the meter read cycle, 
rather than current practice of simply stating the monthly procurement 
price(s) but only showing the total, bundled price for each cycle on the 
invoice. For example, show "100 therms at April price of $0.25 = $25.00, plus 
50 therms at May price of $0.30 = $15.00, plus transport fee of $50.00, 
equals $90.00"; rather than the current practice of showing "usage of 150 
therms from April 10 to May 10 equals $90.00.")
All SEMPRA materials regarding core aggregation should emphasize advantages 
of transport-only service: the availability of fixed or other pricing plans 
to more closely meet end-user risk management needs (emphasizing that SEMPRA 
has only a one-size-fits-all pricing option), the availability of customized 
bill presentment and delivery (potentially saving multi-site end-users 
thousands of dollars per year and reducing paper for all end-users), 
availability of discounts on other goods or services not offered by SEMPRA, 
etc.
