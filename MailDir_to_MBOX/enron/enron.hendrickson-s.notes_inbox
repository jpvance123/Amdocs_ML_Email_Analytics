In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the 
Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of 
MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and 
outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each 
message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and 
inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following 
attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, 
*.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these 
e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how 
to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful 
e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down 
time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or 
malicious code.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be 
connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center

this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, 
this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No 
network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual 
physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th 
floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 
2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT).

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Applied Finance - May 31-June 1, 2001 
in EB552   Cost:  $700.00

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but 
rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals 
contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with 
insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work 
that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to 
Enron's transactions.
R A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the "deal space" and 
how the financial principals discussed  relate to  Enron deals.
R The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron 
deal.

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at 
(713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at 
(713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to 
iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?
For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <
mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>.

provide world-class, enterprise-wide solutions through innovation, the 
building of new relationships, and by providing superior customer support.  

One of the most exciting changes that the ISC has made is that we will be 
providing our customers with a single contact number for all support needs.  
Customers needing assistance on any ISC supported application will simply 
call 713-345-4727 and a Customer Care Agent will assist you.
