The Raiders have always been my team. The Chargers are my Home team.
I will ask about the Vegas weekend.

What????  I thought that was your team?  I am a big raiders fan and I hope
Chucky gets that ring this year.  Hey, FYI, we are getting a guys trip to
Las Vegas for the first weekend of March Madness if you are interested -
March 13-16th.  Got a room at the Mirage and it is $120 per person for the
three nights.  I figure air fare is pretty cheap from SD, let me know if
you are interested.  Take care.

   that is absolutely hilarious.  I have heard a rumor that the Chargers
   are
   considering moving to LA....Is that correct?  That will be absolutely
   horrendous.  I saw the game of the century the other day on ESPN
   classics...Chargers vs. Dolphins 1983.  Truly awesome.  My man at the

FYI - since we are moving this weekend, do not put your trader packets on your trader's desk tomorrow night.  Give them to Bruce(since he is the slowest) and he will bring them in Monday morning and distribute to our trader's.  Everyone needs to be here by 7 a.m. on Monday in order to answer any questions your traders have and test out your systems.  If things are messed up, we want to get the IT people first.  Thanks and shout with any questions.

see this spreadsheet, you will see that previous months match.  This spreadsheet comes straight from our crude guys.  If the counterparty continues to disagree, get documentation from them and we can take it to the crude guys.  Thanks.

Philip,

The attached file contains settle prices for crude.  The NXAVC code price is in cell "D48" which I have highlighted in yellow.  There is also historical data in the file where you can verify prior months.  If you have any other questions please ask.

Did you receive confirmation from Cecilia that these were indeed moved?  Entergy Koch is one of the entities that Mechelle Stevens is questioning.

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Subject: 7 new terrorists identified in Alabama


Latest news reports advise that a cell of 7 terrorists has been operating in the Alabama area. Law enforcement officials advised earlier today that 6 of the 7 have been detained.

The FBI stated that the terrorists bin Fishin, bin Huntin, bin Drinkin, bin Cussin, bin Fightin, and bin Dippin Skoal have been arrested on Immigration charges. 

The FBI advised further that they can find no one fitting the description of the seventh cell member, bin Workin.

Police are confident that anyone in Alabama who looks like he's bin Workin will be very easy to spot.

Just wanted to let you guys in on a few things we have talked with Gossett about.  Today we officially begin the process for the New Company.  That being said, we now have to tighten the ship a bit.  From now on, please refrain from playing games and surfing the internet all day.  If you are bored and don't have anything to do, please look for things to do that are work related.  This is a good time to improve your skills and learn about things you are not absolutely proficient in.  Read some options books, study macros in the P&L's, etc.  The key phrase here is work to improve your skills so that we can shake off some of the rust we have developed in the last month.  All of this is coming from Goss and it is serious, to be a part of the new company you have to show that you are willing to contribute and are the best of the best.  

I know this sounds harsh, but we have all had a nice vacation and I am sure most of you are like me and looking forward to not having such a boring job.  It looks as though bidders will be in this week, so we will have some reports and demonstrations to give.  

Please pull me aside or email me if you have any further questions.

Thanks and Happy New Year.

good, I have some direct meters forms that are under tolerance.  Not a big deal, I simply signed them without looking at them.

In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SOCAL.  I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take?  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Could you also set Bruce Mills, Kristen Clause and Edward Brady up like Scott Palmer.  Additionally can you also set up Ashley Worthing like Anne Bike.  Thanks for you help and shout with any questions.

still do not have anything from a contract standpoint.  I will try and put some time into it today.  AS of last Friday, I now have responsibility for the East desk instead of the Central, but I will include Scott Palmer in my work since he now is over the Central.  I am not abandoning you, it is just that my workload has drastically increased trying to wrap up central desk issues, get Scott up to speed and get myself up to speed on the East desk.  We will get a resolution ASAP.  Thanks.

Subject:	FW: Nicor Hub contracts

It has been Sylvia's understanding that Nicor Gas Company is a hub which is a storage facility, not the inverse.  We believe there has been a misinterpretation as to what has been stated.  In fact, these contracts have been setup since 1995.


Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.


 << File: Nicor Gas Company Contracts.xls >>  << File: Northern Illinois Gas Company.xls >> 


These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.


We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.  


If you need our assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Thank You.

That will be good going forward if all goes well, however we still need to address the outstanding issues in order to clear the Receivables and Payables.  I will be giving Marlene a copy of the tariff and see if she can get contracts setup.

When I get my reports for October we will go out and set up storage contracts for what we have right now and start using them accordingly.  Part of the problem has been in the way we have to send Nicor on an EDI process.  I am going to revisit and see if we can test in stage doing it thru CPR tickets and if that works then there should be no problem.  Please keep me posted and anything I can do to be of assistance please let me know. 

Thanks,

Cora

Subject:	Nicor Hub contracts

We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

Please look at Sheet 1(2).  You will see there are numbers Lee attribute to You and I.  I wanted to go over the months that there is a large difference - see what counter parties make up the difference so that we can determine the absolute correct number for him.  I also wanted to discuss OA if we have time.  I have a 10:30 meeting and if you need to get back to the auditors, we can address at a later date.  Thanks.

FYI - reminder that the last person here every night needs to publish to the web the East P&L and the East Positions.  Everyone should have access to this and if you do not know how to load these files, let me know.  We have all been guilty of forgetting this, including myself.  We owe a big thank you to Kulvinder who has saved us a couple of nights in the last week.  Thanks.

The only books that should still have deals in them, other than NG-Price, will be 

Intra-Ont-Cad		all canadian gas daily deals
NGPR-Can
Oil-NG-Spec
Ft-Ont-Central		all consolidated price/basis deals

these books will still have to be calculated after today.

All counterparty deals were moved over the weekend but any remaining desk to desk deals were not touched.  We need to move those ourselves today.
All others need to be calculated and officialized one more time today then inactivated on the Rac website for tomorrow.

I figure you are going to turn around and sell them on Ebay(current price is $77).  So, I will sell you the two pinnacle cases for $250, roughly $31 a sleeve.  I now have two cases of the titleist golf balls that will also sell at the same price.  I can send you a picture tonight, when I get home.  I can ship tomorrow or Saturday, I will pay for the shipping.  If you are interested, let me know.  Thanks.

can send payment via paypal for them.
If you have a picture showing the boxes that would be

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks 
Darla Saucier

The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books. Please note that there are still several deals that I am trying to reconcile back to Sitara numbers. Assuming that I can do so, I will send supplemental information tomorrow afternoon.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Good morning,

I am Lisa Guilliams and will be taking over the responsibilities of Rachel Crowell for Portfolio Accounting.  I have been in training for the last week with Rachel, and hope to make a smooth transition into my new position.  I am transferring from ENA Reporting for various Support Departments, so this is a new experience for me.  Rachel is transferring to Gas Accounting.

Attached are the October 2001 variances between the Risk P&L and the General Ledger.  Please review the items and make Schedule E adjustments for the items that belong to you.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

In future months, I will provide this at least one week prior to month end.  I apologize for the delay this month.

I look forward to working with you,
Lisa Guilliams
Portfolio Accountant

still working.  I hope to have it completed before the week is out.  As I am sure you are experiencing as well all the fire drills that are currently going on around here, I have been running since I got back from vacation.  Believe me when I say this is a high priority for me as well because of all the potential P&L fallout for the traders who have been entering this information.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks 
Darla Saucier

Kam and Phillip,

I understand you all have been a little busy lately.   When you get a free moment would you please send me an updated copy of your Cost of Inventory schedules for Central and East.  We have until late tomorrow to book the value.  One nice thing about the West Desk is no storage COI.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

Please pass on the sentiments of at least 3 Auburn Alumni.  The students that appear in the pictures from Halloween dressed in racial costumes should be immediately expelled from the University and their respective fraternities should be permanently removed from campus.  We also think that PartyPics.com should be disciplined and removed from the vendor list for the University.  Auburn University and it's related organizations should not contribute money to organizations that are willing to take pictures of such insulting behavior and try and profit from them by selling them to disgusting human beings that would participate in such offensive behavior.

As graduates of Auburn University and Athletic and Academic Scholarship donors, we are appalled by these students behavior and demand immediate action be taken against them.  The longer this issue is not dealt with, the worse our University looks in the eyes of the world.  Please take action and help save Auburn's reputation.  Thanks for your assistance.

Please pass on the condolences of another part of the Auburn family to Mr. Walker.  We are all truly hurt by the passing of his mother.  From the recent articles I have read in the Alabama papers, it appears she was a phenomenal mother and friend.  We were also pleased to see his positive comments regarding his teammates, fellow students and alumni of Auburn.  The auburn spirit is special and it means a lot to those of us who spent time there to hear current players and students share the same beliefs.  We are sure he will continue to honor his mother and her memory by his outstanding play on the field and dedication in the classroom.  Thank you Mr. Walker for making us all proud to be an Auburn Tiger.  Please respond via email to let us know if the University or anyone else has set up a memorial fund or scholarship in her name.  We would really like to donate money in her name.  Thanks and War Eagle.

I have some good news and some bad news.  The good news is that I invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks.  The bad news is that I invested it in enron stock.  So, needless to say I am going to have to default on this year's payouts.

know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't... 11 letters in "THE RED
CROSS," can't trust them. I would rely on self defense, but "SELF

No, don't... "SEND ME EMAIL" has 11 letters....

I think the only other solution is to post two curves, one with an SP and one with PR.  You should be able to simply set up the same curves as risk type PR and have it look to the SP curve.   Then you would publish two curves with the exact same name and value, just two different risk types.  The only other option I see is to change the deals back to the "old" aeco curve that we used prior to this.

Importance:	High

Brian,
Please help us resolve the issue around curve:

GD-AECOCD/FRWKD

The issue is that this curve is only for risk type "SP" as well as having prices posted for only one 1 reference date, i.e. today.

There are only two solutions:
1.	We need you to rename it from risk type "SP" to risk type "PR" 
a.	Post prices for balance of month, currently you are only posting a price for one day.
2.	Or, we need you to put out a brand new curve out tonight for this deal.
a.	Book admins would have to move all positions to this new curve today
b.	This new curve would have to have Book type code M, and curve type code PR
c.	Map it to omicron 9, primary curve mapping AECO/Basis, vol group CGPR/EMPRESS
d.	Prices have to be posted for daily term structure.  

This is urgent as Lavorato has a position on this curve and is rather firmly demanding that VAR be captured.

To all, am I thinking about this correctly?

Thanks,
Frank

PS.  If Brian is unable to post curve, maybe we can post it here.  (i.e. we cannot have VAR without price and vol curve)

can you follow up with the Forum group for me.  It appears only 3 of my six employees returned the feedback.  I have been assured by every member of my team that they sent these in on time.  Several members of our class yesterday had the same issue, with one not having any returned.  This seems curious enough to investigate.  Thanks for your help.

Bruce Mills called me.  He said you told him to work on it with me.  I left him a message on Friday, but I haven't heard back.  Below is my spreadsheet of the variances.  Why don't you take a look at it and let me know if you have any questions.  I have compared what Consumers invoiced to what we have in Unify.  I haven't made it through 1999 yet, so that tab is blank.  I need help on the deals that have differences and the ones that Consumers did not invoice me for.  I have tried to highlight them all in red.  I can come down in the morning to go over it with you, if you have time.

That is fucking hilarious.

Check out this article about Tuberville that was published today.

(Taken from the Mobile Register)

Tub doing a lousy job

12/04/01





Walking into Tiger Stadium at dusk Saturday, amidst a whiskey river of LSU
fans, a friend looked at me and screamed over the cacophony of chants:

"I don't know what to make out of this game," he said. "I don't know if I'm
going to be more upset if we (Auburn) win or we get blown out again."

  <http://www.al.com/images/spacer.gif>

The meaning was clear: Under Thomas Hawley Tuberville, you never really know
what you will find under the big tent, whether Dr. Jeckyl or Mr. Hyde?

Well, after three hours in the sea of debauchery better known as Death
Valley, where fans, chomping (Tuberville induced) cigars and yelling
profanities and vulgarities, it became crystalline where the state of Auburn
football lies right now.

Under water.

Perhaps, the most amazing conclusion of the long evening on the Bayou is the
Auburn football program actually has accomplished something I never dreamed
possible: It showed less class than the LSU fans, who have earned a
reputation as some of the worst in college football.

I had to laugh afterwards when Tuberville, with a straight face (he is a
riverboat gambler, after all), talked about this program exceeding
expectations with a 7-4 record. Give me a break. I picked Auburn to go 7-4
in this space on Aug. 14 and so did many others. Of course, nobody predicted
this team would mail in several games without any effort.

On Saturday night, this football coaching staff was like the gang that
couldn't shoot straight. A national television audience witnessed some of
dumbest coaching decisions ever.

What a total lack of class for the Auburn players to be dancing on the LSU
logo before the game. What has this group accomplished, other than winning a
trip to a bowl game that no one cares about? What about the totally
classless act of the kicking team getting in the way of the LSU marching
band at the end of halftime? One is tempted to criticize the players. But in
the end, you really can't.

They are just a manifestation of a head football coach, whose frat-boy smile
about everything and inability to get the bigger pictures has a trickle down
effect on everyone -- especially the players. Tuberville always talks --
doe-eyed -- about his mentor Jimmy Johnson. Apparently, some of the Johnson
mystique has really rubbed off, when it comes to classlessness and thug
behavior.

Tuberville loses by 24 to Alabama and instead of taking the blame, he makes
fun of the opposing coach for starting the wrong quarterback all year. Nine
days later, he finally apologizes to the Auburn family, that is, in a mea
culpa that reeked of Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair.

This is a head football coach being paid $1.3 million a year. But if you
think Tuberville earned his money this year, think again. And word is he
can't believe the unhappiness in the ranks. He wonders how people can turn
on him after the job he has done.

What has he done?

In three years, he has gone 5-6, 9-4 and now 7-4. Add it up: 21-14 (.600).
Bob Davie got fired Sunday for going .583 at Notre Dame. Of course, among
those 21 wins are victories against Appalachian State, Idaho, Central
Florida, Wyoming, Northern Illinois, Ball State, Louisiana Tech (twice) and
Vanderbilt (twice). That's a total of 10 wins against an industrial-sized
pack of creampuffs. So in legitimate games, he is actually 11-14.

Tub is 1-2 against Alabama (1-6 lifetime) and in the last 13 games, managed
to lose five by double digits (Florida by 21, Syracuse by 17, Arkansas by
25, Alabama by 24 and LSU by 13). Does that give some clue there is a
problem?

Of those 14 losses Tub has suffered at Auburn, 10 have been by double
digits. At Ole Miss, Tuberville's overall record was 25-20. Of the 20
losses, 14 were double digits. Among those 25 wins, Tuberville beat such
heavyweights as Indiana State, Tulane (twice), Memphis (twice), Idaho State,
VMI, Arkansas State (twice), Central Florida, SMU (twice) and Vanderbilt
(four times).

So, if you look at it objectively (the school was hampered by NCAA
limitations), against legitimate teams, his record was 9-20.

Of his current squad, Tuberville talks of them being young. Well, Tommy,
enough already, please. This is your third year. If you can't stand the
heat, call your agent and tell him to find you a new job. I'm sure there's a
big market for a coach who has done as lousy a job as he has in the past few
weeks.

The funniest rumor last week going concerned Tub replacing Nick Saban of LSU
(they share the same agent), believed to be heading to the Indianapolis
Colts. Based on what I heard Saturday night in the Bayou, LSU fans would
burn Tiger Stadium to a crisp before accepting Tub as their head coach.

Assuming Tub graces Auburn with his presence next season (everyone please,
cross your fingers in unison and hold your breath!), he faces a critical
recruiting class and pivotal slate of games. I still think he is a capable
head coach. But things must change.

Before the Iron Bowl, there was a lot of talk about how the pendulum in the
state had shifted. And the prognosticators were correct. Except they missed
one important element. The pendulum has shifted in this series -- toward
Alabama. Despite all the hardship and distractions, Dennis Franchione
appears to have Alabama heading in the right direction on all sides of the
ledger -- including style and class.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Tommy Tuberville and his Auburn
football program.

(Paul Finebaum's column appears Tuesday and Saturday in the Mobile
Register).

According to Hully - we have a game tentatively scheduled for tomorrow at 7 p.m.  He needs to know ASAP who can play because of some snafu at the Y(we were supposed to play last night and they forgot to call him).  Let me know today if you can play and I will let him know so he can call the Y.  Thanks.

I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding EBay=

 you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid.  =
I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm=
 your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your payment =
if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than some of the=
 balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid $60 will re=
spond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to intervene o=
n your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up, but it look=

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at
$6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry i=
f
you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these ball=

were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or
higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment,
but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are
planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not,
I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as
possible.  Thanks.

 What do you think about setting up a meeting between your group and mine in which each of us gives a short 15 minute presentation on what we do and how things other groups do affect our group.  If you think we will need more time, maybe we set up two meetings.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

I was under the impression that there was an outstanding A/R and A/P balance on this counterparty in the 4-5 million dollar range.  Should be pretty noticeable.

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks

We just wanted to let you guys know of some changes in order to keep the te=
rminations being processed in a timely manner.  It appears that all Netco e=
mployees may be taken off of systems access for Enron this weekend.  In cas=
e this is true, Darron and I have transitioned from handling these requests=
.  Greg Couch is going to be leading the estate risk effort and Pat Ryder a=
nd Chance Rabon will be handling all termination list issues.  Please send =
these lists to these three people in lieu of Darron and I.  As a side note,=
 could you send an updated financial termination list(if this list has chan=
ged since you sent it to me Kim) to these guys so that they can verify deal=
s are moved to the proper book.  It is probably a good idea for future term=
ination scripts to come through Greg before going to IT because of several =
book moves we have made to facilitate reporting to Ed McMichael.  For examp=
le the price book has been basically split into three books.  Please shout =
with any questions or concerns you may have.  Thanks.

sorry I did not get back with you last night, we were up in Navasota all weekend with some friends enjoying the clean and quiet country air.  We also went to the Renaissance Festival.  Things are getting pretty hectic around here.  There are a number of individuals who are responsible for destroying one of the best companies in America in less than a year.  It is all pretty amazing and really still has not sunk in.  We are all just trying to continue with business as usual and hope for the best.  If I do get laid off, I just hope to get a really good package.  

How are things in Denver?  Good I hope.  How is that baby?  Is she getting bigger?  I hope so.  Drop me a line and let me know what is going.  Thanks for the call.

Hey.  My friend Chad (i think you remember him) just moved back here from Houston and is currently in job search mode.  He is in the same field as you..and worked for Raymond James in Houston.  He has some pretty good leads here..and some may pan out for more than just him.  Once he has things settled...meaning when he has a job he will be helpful to you.  Once I know more I will let you know.

Exec-u-Trak is currently working on over 50 positions in the following  states: 
Ohio California Minnesota Pennsylvania Michigan Arkansas Texas 
Louisiana Washington Tennessee Illinois Florida Virginia Alabama 
Arizona South Carolina Missouri New York 
Open positions cover a wide range of responsibilities including CFO,  Reimbursement, Patient Accounting and Business Office, Controller and  Consulting. 
Attached are positions open and listed through HFMA's Exec-u-Trak  Confidential Resume Referral Service. This list is sent to you monthly for your  information and distribution to Chapter membership via meetings, newsletters  and/or your web site. Because Chapters change many leadership positions, if  there is a more appropriate person in your Chapter that should also receive this  information, please let us know by name, email address and Chapter.  
Many organizations are in process of finalizing their recruitment plans and  budgets. We wanted to remind you of The Healthcare Financial Management's  Exec-u-Trak's annual option that will allow organizations unlimited access to  the program. This is more cost effective than individual ads or other  independent actions, especially if staffing plans call for at least two  recruitment efforts. 
We have attached some preliminary information to review share with members  and Human Resources professionals. 
HFMA's Exec-u-Trak has over 2500 members in its database, presented more than  120 positions this year and continues to serve both members and organizations in  the recruitment process.

grab me tomorrow and let's discuss.  I am not aware of which calc sheets she had to do, so let's look at them together and go from there.  I know Melissa does some also.  Thanks for pulling double duty training Michelle and doing the east desk.  Hope you had a good thanksgiving.

Alejandra gave me a 5 min. crashcourse through the four calc sheets she updates at the end of the month.  I know that Kam knows about them so I'll just check with her but Alejandra also recommended splitting up these four sheets among everyone else to lighten the load...just a thought for next month.  Also, after training Michelle on Gd-Central and Gulf I definitely feel (hopefully not a false sense) ahead of the curve about the things i've learned...a compliment to your work also.

He has some pretty good leads here..and some may pan out for more than just him.  Once he has things settled...meaning when he has a job he will be helpful to you.  Once I know more I will let you know.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Norman (AP)

Oklahoma University Athletic Director Joe Castiglione announced today that
due to recent developments, the renovations at Owen Field are well ahead of
schedule and will come in under costs. Seems over 71,000 fans shit a brick
during the fourth quarter of the bedlam football game, providing the
necessary materials to begin work right away.

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not, I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as possible.  Thanks.

I am sorry, but that will be the only game the chargers play the rest of the year I will not route for them.  I am a die hard Raider fan(I am sure they are your least favorite team).  How about LaDanian?  He is ripping it up for me in fantasy.

I hope it is not Woody, Vandy sucked at offense and defense.  He is horrible and I would hope we would go after somebody else.  We need to get someone in there soon so they can put the offense/defense in and the players can start studying it to get a head start on next year.  I am afraid if Tubby doesn't turn it around next year he may be gone.

I got a digital camera for Christmas that works real well, I will get some pictures to you.

To read the articles about Auburn, Tubberville says HE made the decision
they should go.  Yeah, right!  I'm sure he was told by Lowder that
either they went or he did.  So, they were given the opportunity to
resign, and both chose to do so.  There's already 3 or 4 candidates to
replace each.  They expect to have the offensive guy in the next 2
weeks.  Maybe a little longer for the defense.  Only remember 1 name:
Woody Weidenhofer from Vandy for offense.  Can't say that I've ever
heard of the others.

Oh well, we'll see how it all pans out.

Thanks for the address.  I'll send the picture soon.

sorry Pop, I forgot to send this to you.  My home email is
plove@houston.rr.com.  Talk to you this weekend.  I heard Auburn got
rid of Off and Def coordinator.  We will see if that changes anything.

As I said, take it up with EBay or the individual you outbid.  I see your max bid says $1600, an obvious mistake that you had to approve unless EBay made a mistake.  For the last time $61 is obviously not out of the price range for those balls this weekend, you won by a dollar.  You can cancel your bid before the auction ends and you did not.  Per the attachment I sent, you have another 5 days to decide to pay or get Ebay to adjust it or I will seek payment through them.

I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding
EBay's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person
that you outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would
suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest
bid.  I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to
confirm your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your
payment if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than
some of the balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid
$60 will respond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to
intervene on your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up,
but it looks like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.

   I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid
   at
   $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am
   sorry if
   you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these
   balls
   were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or
   higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an
   adjustment,
   but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are
   planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If
   not,
   I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as
   possible.  Thanks.

Do you want to keep any of the old TRV files for Netco for any reason.  We can create new ones once it is set up.

FYI - this is set up and has been added as a tab to the bankruptcy post id sheet(CAN).  If you open the attachment, you will see she set these up as MMBTU/USD books in Risktrac.  I talked with Cecilia and she has changed this in ERMS/TAGG effective today to be GJ/CAD.  Not sure how this happened, but it is fixed now.  Should not have any problems, there is nothing in this book currently.  Let me know if we need to calc these when I get back on Wednesday.

Bernice - please set up the attached book request and notify when complete.

Francis/Cecilia - I will be out of the office Thursday and Friday (Dec 20 and 21).  Please handle the Erms side once Bernice sends out the notification.

I have already set up these books in RisktRAC.

Due to the Outlook problems, I was unable to handle this request in a timely fashion.  Sorry for any delays this may have caused.

Thanks everyone and have a happy and safe holiday!

The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books. Please note that there are still several deals that I am trying to reconcile back to Sitara numbers. Assuming that I can do so, I will send supplemental information tomorrow afternoon.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Thank you,

I received your name from Kam Keiser.  We are both managers in risk management at Enron.  Kam had mentioned that you are in the process of recruiting for several clients in the energy industry.  I have roughly 4 years experience in the industry with 2.5 of those years in risk management.  Prior to employment with Enron, I worked for a big six accounting firm and in the healthcare industry for the University of Texas.  I am interested in staying in the energy field.  If you think one of your clients might be interested, I would like to send my resume on to you.  If they or you are not interested, I apologize for taking up your time today.  Thanks and I hope to hear from you soon.

Phil,

Please see the attached file with the current structure for Central Gas desk by trader.  For each trader, these are the books that he/she trades.  I am assuming that this list by trader has all books whether active / inactive.  Please review and ensure that all books with or without positions are being captured by traders.  Can you respond by Friday, Oct. 12th.   Thanks.

FYI, 
I spoke with the erms team about the problem we have with curveview going through runm.  If you open runm on your PC instead of a sun machine, you need to open curveview first.  If open curveview before any other applications, the screen will be blue and all others will be set up correctly as well.  According the Erms guys this is an ancient program and they are unable to fix the logic.  Pass this on to your groups.

Phillip,
 
There are several deals in TAGG with an ENA book name of UN-NY; examples are N67489.6 and N67489.C.  I am trying to find out the long description for the book and where the deal value would be captured.  Can you help?  The examples above were set up in 2000 and run through 2003.
 
Best regards,

FYI - I have done the west and I have resaved this file out there.  I highlighted the rows to be changed in yellow.  If we all do this, we should be able to use the same list.  I added a column to the file and put IM S/B, LT S/B and Daily S/B.

The sitara mapping table is saved in the Netco file named CurveMappings.xls

Check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore, make a list of those and what the new mappings should be.  Once the new database is set up we will get with Russ to have those changed over.

Hey Philip!

What's up? I have mixed feeling about you going to
ND...I', jealous! This year is out for me
unfortunately.  I have some friends that have gone to
games this year...I'll get the skinny on scalping.  It
shouldn't be much of a prop.  However, despite there
records, it's still ND and Tennesse. It will be sold
out.  But you can get tix.  I know this much. You
can't (or it's against school policy to )get tix on
campus. However, there are plenty of scalper on roads
leading to campus.

Sites to see.  Definietly check out the campus.  Make
time to see the lakes, go by the dome etc. It's
awesome. Also, it may be one of the games of the
week...so, look out for espn, nbc and all the rest.
The hype is great when networks other than nbc show.
Lots of small bars...avoid the linebacker, unless you
want to test that you have the endurance you had in
undergrad. College Football Hall of Fame is
there...downtown.  Tailgating is great....like I said
make sure you get to the game early. That way you'll
get the whole experience. Lots of tradition game day,
for example the Band marches from the dome to the
stadium....it's awesome.

I'll give you a call at work..

Later,

Steve

FYI :
When entering deals with Canada, please remember to have the counter parties in a financial deal to be ECC and Riskmantra and a physical deal it will be ENA to ECC.
Also remember on gas daily out months(2 legs) that the book on the gas daily swap leg needs to be INTRA-CND-WE-GD not INTRA-CAND-WEST(this book is for basis piece).

ALSO:
Please remember to check your new deals completely every day, this will help eliminate future OA variances.  Do not rely on your trader to catch mistakes.

Thanks.

All,

I am currently reviewing the OA assignments for each desk to determine whether I need to move employees to a different region.  Please let me know if you are satisfied with your OA coordinator.  This will ensure that each of you are getting the proper level of support that you require.  In addition, if there is anything that you think we can do better either as a group or on an individual basis, I welcome that as well.  Thanks.

Per John Lavorato, we killed all desk to desk deals on Dec. 13th.  That is why this deal was killed.  You mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed.  Can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed.  It is our understanding that all desk to desk(book to book) should be killed because no cash actually changes hands.  Should this deal have been with an external counterparty?

Phillip,

Below is the information for the CGAS book that was killed on 12/13/01.  This book should have liquidated in December.  Can we get this deal back?

Guys:  Just a reminder to have everyone check their physical Index deals carefully.  We have been discussing this issue with Tara and thought that it was a one time issue that had been resolved, but today, Tuesday, we found that EOL is still booking certain Fiz Index deals incorrectly.

Look for a 0.00 in Basis.

On most of ours the deals did not show up in any of our calcs because the Nymex reference is not populated.

NXAVC is just like nymex, it settles as one price for the entire month.  I don't know what you mean look for pricing for 9/11-9/14.  NXAVC is a monthly index.  Please clarify.

Phillip,

Agave had several days incorrect and has corrected them, however my counterpart informed me that they have not been able to confirm the pricing for days 9/11 - 9/14. Those four days were priced at $29.53. Is there anyway to find out if the crude guys can provide support for those day? I would think there may have been some special pricing provisions after the events of the 11th.

Thanks,
Genaro

Subject:	phys/gd curve file

Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.

I too am a little worried about the outcome on Saturday.  I am bringing two friends that are University of Texas Alums and am just hoping to show them a good time and what true tailgating is all about.

There will be including myself 7 adults and my 3 year old son.  Is that too many?  Please let me know.  Everyone is extremely exciting and my son is now to the age that he will really enjoy it.  Last year we always took him on game day to see the raptors and he was kind of interested, but now he really enjoys animals.  

Thanks again for all of your help arranging this trip.  Please also let me know again when the scholarship dinner is going to be held, I am sure some of my family would really enjoy attending.  Thanks see you at Chuck's.

I'm planning on it. In fact, I talked with Joe Shelnutt a little while ago
and reminded him I'm bringing you guys out there after 1 pm.

If you want, I can plan to meet you at Chuck's at 12:15 Friday.  How many
in your party?

PS...After watching us the past 2 games and watching UF against LSU, I
revise my earlier prediction and now am thinking it is not going to be
pretty.

FYI - Andy and Martin will be giving classes to the trading track guys on the two different locations.  They are opening these classes to everyone.  I would recommend that you attend, I am going to try and attend as well.  THE ONLY CATCH IS THERE WILL BE A TEST AT THE END AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SHARED WITH HUNTER.  I think it would look very good if you attend, I only caution you to pay close attention because the two guys have been known to ask tough questions.

Do we need to make any changes to the EOL products?  I see that Steve South is now on the trader list, does he need any products for EOL?  I will work on the curves and get with you on a first pass.  Thanks.

We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.  I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.  Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

We need to take the central off before the NY, NY Market, southeast curve files.  We need to add the GDI East curve file.  Also add the two east phy/gas daily curve files - o:tds/tds curve/east/intramonth & gas daily files/eastprodnewstyle and eastmktnewstyle.  Sandra's curve file is o:tds/tds curve/east/fteast.

Are there any other files/directories that the estate people in risk will need to use to do their jobs.  IT will have to go into each macro and change the database that it is using to the new one they are creating this weekend.  I don't know if any of you are still using any exotic spreadsheets other than the transport model.  Please let me know if there is anything I'm missing.  (curve files)

Here are the files that use ERMS that the estate will be using.

O:\erms\erms_adm\firmtrad\Benchmark\2002\Jan-02
O:\erms\erms_adm\firmtrad\2002\0102\regions
O:\erms\Excel Queries\ (Netco will need a copy of these files moved with them)

Howdy everyone!

Rebecca, myself and the pumpkin will be gracing the Great State of Texas in
late Feb.  During this time, we will be hosting a post wedding reception on
Sunday the 24th. of February, 2002 at the Coliseum Restaurant in Clear Lake.
  We plan on starting the party at around 1300.  It will be a semi formal
type of occasion, so just bring an appetite and get ready for a great
afternoon!

If you could please let us know via email if you can make it and if you will
be bringing a significant other, we would greatly appreciate it.

We look forward to seeing everyone there!

Tommy
GO STELLERS!!!!!!

Per an email from Mike Grigsby, I understand we are splitting the west into two regions.  You are going to be doing the SW and socal per Mike's email.  I am attaching the curve files we have created.  Please take a look at them and make sure I am not missing curves or have included wrong ones.  We are only going to be setting published locations initially.  I am sending you the curves in three parts due to the size of the files.  The Index file has phys index and GDY, and the Phy file has BOM phys and GD.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

The books are FT-INT-CEN-MKT2-BAS,GDI,GDL,IDX,PRC and INTRA_CNT-MKT2-PHY.  Jim should not need to be set up in the system, because he was in Chicago, he should just need books added.

Kam Keiser suggested I call you to help with a request I received from our auditors.  Can you give me a list of all of the deals that have been put into Sitara for the Chicago office - the book/counterparty name will be Enovate.  The Arthur Anderson auditors have requested this information.  They are doing an audit of Enovate and want a list of all of the deals since the book started in order to get a sample size for their audit.  you should not have to go back farther than 01/00.  Thanks for your help and shout if you need anymore information.

Russ/George - has this new location been mapped to the same curves as the previous location - PGLC/NGPL?  From my standpoint, I think that is the only thing that needs to be done with the exception of changing/adding swaps on these deals.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

We have moved november deals to the new location?? is that going to be a problem??  They were previously on PGLC/NGPL/909285 and they were moved to PGLC/NGPL/TTP.  These deals will need to be moved to the new trade zone of TTP.    Is there anything else we need  to do for Sitara?? and if so who do we need to contact?   THanks!!

 It is important to note that no deals can be moved to this new location until this location is mapped in Sitara,(mid, notional, and gas daily curves)
otherwise any deals booked there will error out in CPR.

	George Grant has set up the new Trade Zone, TTP, for Meter No. TTP, on PGLC.  He has told me there are 44 deals behind Meter No.

Mr. Grant,

	Cora Pendergrass is  asking for a Trade Zone in PGLC to be created.  She also would like me to change the Trade Zone on meter 

TTP to this new Trade Zone.  She has told me she has already changed the deals behind the meter to match the new Trade Zone.  

I will change the Trade Zone with your final approval.


Trade Zone:	  PGLC TTP		Meter:	TTP		Pipecode:      PGLC


Please let me know as soon as possible.

Effective November 1, 2001 we need to set up a new trade  zone for PGLC.  The new zone should be called PGLC TTP.  The meter number TTP should be mapped to this new trade zone.  It is currently under NGPL.  We have moved deals for November 1, 2001 to this new point on ENA, EMW and ENV.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Also we are trying to get to a point to upload this file for next month so when this is updated can you let me know?  Thanks for your help!!

FYI - based on a call I got from Chris Abel in controls.  Not sure if any of your guys roll from the regions file instead of daily.

Subject:	FYI - ROLLING YOUR P&L'S

Just wanted to send you an FYI - due to problems that are caused for RAC, please roll your P&L's each day from your daily file and not the regions file.  The RAC group looks at our P&L's in the region files each morning to determine rho and drift and this causes a problem if you have saved your P&L after rolling(it appears as though you have data already captured for current day because it copies and pastes formulas from the prior day to current day).  Thanks for your help and shout with any questions.

Please set up Souad Mahmassani in risktrac.  She is a new trader on the central desk.  She will be running the Aruba and central transport books.  The following books will be her responsibility:
ARUBA-SPLY-PRC
ARUBA-TP-PHY
FT-PEOPLES-BAS,PRC,IDX,GDL
FT-CENTRAL-OPT-BAS,GDL,IDX,PRC

Souad would need to roll up to the Central desk in natural gas, I would say she should be set up similar to Denver Plachy.

Please shout with any questions or additional information that you may need.  Thanks.

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called his
office as recent as today.  The petition for removal is ready to sign but I
have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of filing
as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you
familiar with Wyatt Howell or his firm.  That is the firm I would like to
associate.  Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Dear Phillip-

In an effort to clean up RisktRAC, we have created a new hierarchy structure in RisktRAC that is currently in the testing phases.  I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the new hierarchy structure for Central Gas (please look at all the tabs).  Also included is a list of your books that are linked to the lowest level portfolio of the hierarchy structure.  

Could you please review the proposed hierarchy structure and let me know of any issues (i.e. all traders are captured or that we don't have any "extra" traders reflected.)  
Additionally, could you please review the "books" tab and ensure that the book list is complete and accurate and that the book is linked to the correct trader (please note - if more than one trader trades out of the same book, the book should be assigned to the most senior trader.  Please ensure that this has been done correctly).  Please advise us of any missing books as well.
Finally, I would like to get an understanding of what reports/hierarchies you all are currently using in RisktRAC and for what purpose.

 I would like a response ASAP, but by Monday at the latest.  Please call me to discuss at your convenience or email me your response.  Thanks, Phillip.

Christy

Please set up Souad Mahmassani in risktrac.  She is a new trader on the central desk.  She will be running the Aruba and central transport books.  The following books will be her responsibility:
ARUBA-SPLY-PRC
ARUBA-TP-PHY
FT-PEOPLES-BAS,PRC,IDX,GDL
FT-CENTRAL-OPT-BAS,GDL,IDX,PRC

Souad would need to roll up to the Central desk in natural gas, I would say she should be set up similar to Denver Plachy.

Please shout with any questions or additional information that you may need.  Thanks.

The curve files for Netco will need to be modified before they are used in the new environment.


    1)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to ermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7525
Change the Network Address on the 5th row to ;239.44.16.1;     

2) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

3)	Save your curves as normal

4)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

I've seen a couple recently approaching 1/2 gigabyte.  As a result, we are wasting tons of disk space.

We have discovered a problem with physical positions in TDS.  Changed deals potentially can double up the deals volume in TDS.
The TDS group worked late Monday to try and resolve the issue, but failed.  Please let your traders know that the physical positions
cannot be completely relied on.

I have also left a message on you phones to get this message to you.

Thanks

Subject:	Weekend Events.........

As most of you already know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'm going to address why all this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing problems we are having?

About 8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUSD-DAIL.  On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD-AECOCD/FRWKD.  We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primary/Secondary curve mapping table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-month curve either (OMICRON).  

On Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /secondary table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of his positions.  But the desired results were not achieved.  

On Saturday with the help of Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several different combinations of mappings with no positive results.  The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in Component Var.  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.  It exists but, there are no positions in it.  

The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it.  We need to find out why this is so?  Understand also that AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AECO/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes.  

Ramesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very hard this weekend, despite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve this, and have gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing.  

Cuilla is very concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I have to answer to him tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I want us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas VaR.  We also want curve mapping to become a more front-end solution (with very few users) because of their (the front office) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped.  Kam Keiser will help us with this.

In the long-run I don't want any of us to have to do this again and want to identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take time and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but, we have to find a way and, most of all be patient while we address these issues.

Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay we will need your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this?  

Thanks again for all your help this weekend.......

Regards

Bharat

I have some good news and some bad news.  The good news is that I invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks.  The bad news is that I invested it in enron stock.  So, needless to say I am going to have to default on this year's payouts.  

Sorry guys

FYI - the west is wanting to split the region into two regions.  Stephen, I know you have been working on mapping the P&Ls for reporting purpose, the attached file breaks down those two regions.  We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Philip,

I have set up a new position called Central - ENA-IM MGU. When you have time see if you can access it, that way when we do decide
to roll it up into the overall Central position, we will know that there shouldn't be any security issues to contend with.

Yes it will.  This deal is still in the structuring stage.  We simply wanted to get the books set up in TAGG and Sitara for if and when this deal goes live.  I will keep you posted.  I think that logistics is also going to be setting up a pipe called MGU that will have all of these deals on them.  I will get with you when I hear the final so that we can map the correct curves to these locations.  Thanks.

A new Central desk has been set up "ENA - IM MGU" in Sitara.
Is this a new physical desk that will need to have it's positions rollup into the "Central Region Intramonth Position".

Is this value on these deals rought 8K?
If so, tell portfolio acct to put them in and generate a PMA for the gas books.  It is not worth investigating for such a small number and the deal ended 12/01.  Are these the only four deals you have with the gas desk?

Per John Lavorato, we killed all desk to desk deals on Dec. 13th.  That is why this deal was killed.  You mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed.  Can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed.  It is our understanding that all desk to desk(book to book) should be killed because no cash actually changes hands.  Should this deal have been with an external counterparty?

Phillip,

Below is the information for the CGAS book that was killed on 12/13/01.  This book should have liquidated in December.  Can we get this deal back?

what is up rob?  I still have a picture of the four of us on top of that mountain in California with dirt all over us from riding those four wheelers when we were in 9th grade.  I am still here for now - no jokes about the demise of the big E.  Pretty rough carnage through here.  I am sure you guys in California are loving it.  I will give you my secondary email if in fact I am one of the next one's out - plove@houston.rr.com.  Ev just had a baby boy last week - he was one month early and the boy still weighted 9 lbs. 5 ounces.  21 inches long.  His name is Devon Lamar.  Ev has changed companies - his new email address is ESmith@kanekatexas.com.  I am sure he would love to hear from you.  Hope all is well with everyone.

I need to get a list of all TAGG deals since 1/00 that are done with the book FT-ENOV and INTRA-ENOV.  Is this possible.  I need to give a list to Arthur Anderson as soon as possible.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=
ty --- Firm Will Pay Debt, Keep Cash Cushion
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R. Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith an=
d Jathon Sapsford

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=
it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=
idity.=20
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =
outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=
 person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=
oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=
e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =
to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=
 banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But, "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =
few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," s=
aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=
fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we are mak=
ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=
 liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=
n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=
lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=
ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=
 reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =
equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=
s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=
rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=
t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=
s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=
s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =
In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=
o fall several notches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=
n was down six cents at $16.35.=20
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=
re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=
on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=
884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=
erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=
5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=
. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =
of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=
cularly in today's slower economy.=20
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=
t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=
s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=
elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=
ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =
to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=
d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =
the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=
ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20
Chewco was established in 1997 "with approximately $400 million in capital =
commitments" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=
rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =
purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =
for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=
ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=
ent.=20
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=
ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =
comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=
o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =
at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=
se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that "Micha=
el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron." Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=
as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=
erships in July.=20
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=
ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=
t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves "any director or execut=
ive officer." By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =
category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=
ly wouldn't have.=20
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =
According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a "mate=
rial" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=
 statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=
n charge of major business units and "other persons who perform similar pol=
icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =
management."

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financi=

Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 millio=

 $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed =

he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying=
 the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off=

vestment ideas.=20
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman=
 and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice=
 has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning =
in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin=

the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s=

Credit Markets
Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre=
dit-Rating Concerns
By Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGee

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock=
 amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse.=20
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million =
issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on=
 the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% d=
rop during the past two weeks.=20
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct.=
 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resu=
lting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's pric=
e translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. gove=
rnment bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two we=
eks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of "=
spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl=
e B or lower.=20
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing=
 late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit l=
ines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, =
investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yes=
terday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in b=
onds, a small percentage of a typical trade.=20
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con=
cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of=
 troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga=
tion, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer.=20
"Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest," said Harold Ri=
vkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N=
.J.=20
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect thems=
elves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a "default swap" -=
- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac=
e value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit be=
ing insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lu=
cent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology com=
pany's troubles earlier during the year.=20
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-=
rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above=
 the noninvestment-grade level.=20
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possib=
le downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last we=
ek. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of pu=
tting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its lon=
g-term ratings outlook to "negative," citing concerns about the company's f=
inancial flexibility.)=20
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for=
 the worst. "These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis=
tressed levels," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an =
independent fixed-income research firm in New York. "They aren't distressed=
 yet, but they are headed in that direction."=20
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the c=
ompany's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade s=
ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to=
 make good on its commitments.=20
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known fo=
r trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in =
the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacit=
y and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles a=
bout a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets.=
=20
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating=
, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commoditi=
es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without th=
at credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts=
 to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derive=
d from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or c=
ommodity.=20
"Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perceptio=
n that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses," s=
aid Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. "Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron=
's counterparties" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agree=
ment with Enron -- "is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and l=
ooking for ways to minimize it or offset it," Mr. Reynolds said.=20
To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credi=
t analysts said. "I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a =
company that would ever default," Mr. Reynolds said.=20
"So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are s=
ticking with them," said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's=
 utility energy project finance group. "No one has cut credit lines or aske=
d for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have pub=
licly stated that it's business as usual."=20
Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could =
make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron=
's new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to =

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so=
 little about.=20
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critic=
s would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge n=
ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f=
or its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i=
ts most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't fig=
ure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede=
d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif=
ficult to value the company. The company's "lack of disclosure and transpar=
ency," he says, is "a longstanding Enron hallmark."=20
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did =
bump Enron off its "U.S. Select List," which consists of a few dozen top st=
ock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's la=
rger but prestigious "Recommended List" of 200 or so favored stocks, where =
it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993.=20
"Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . =
. . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze =
it' or `I can't figure it out,' " says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclos=
ed number of Enron shares. "If that were the case, there would be an awful =
lot of industries we couldn't follow."=20
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week.=20
"Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a=
 black box," says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, =
who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti=
ng from its fall -- throughout this year. "It was really a trust-me story, =
when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l=
evel of trust."=20
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts lo=
ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly=
 on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had.=
=20
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still rec=
ommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practic=
es are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend tha=
t others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operatio=
ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable?=20
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the=
 issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago b=
y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time =
and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger=
ing questions about the company's various partnership transactions.=20
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th=
e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings.=
=20
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli=
ng, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and=
 level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the=
 stock, 10 had a "strong buy" or equivalent rating on the stock, according =
to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a "buy," thoug=
h not strongly.=20
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a "se=
ll" rating on Enron.=20
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl=
es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospe=
ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante=
d.=20
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general coll=
apse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part=
icularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the compani=
es they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis=
ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an=
d other revenue.=20
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, fo=
r one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Bost=
on, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette=
, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.=20
"Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that=
 hasn't been involved," says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer=
, who still rates the stock a "strong buy" with a $40 price target. "They p=
ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."=20
He adds, "We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Ar=
e we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to pro=
vide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation o=
n the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p=
erformed."=20
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron,=
 calls his holding "a meaningful investment" that is "not small." But he di=
sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer sa=
ys his clients "are happy to know" he has a stake in Enron, because it show=
s he puts his money where his mouth is.=20
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosur=
es of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficu=
lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, =
he wrote that he and many other investors historically "have given Enron th=
e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings" and position a=
s an industry leader.=20
"There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accura=
tely where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make =
their money, but every quarter they do," he says. "It's hard to get inside =
to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."=20
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasio=
nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the=
 financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron=
's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains=
 "confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] an=
d an ultimate recovery in the share price."=20
"I know I'm wrong on the stock," Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these=
 prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even =
in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue =
as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stoc=
k doesn't have much further to fall.=20
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. "Even in relative terms=
, analysts remain very bullish on this stock," says Chuck Hill, director of=
 research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock o=
n Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a "buy" rating. Enron scores a 1.6=
. "This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad=
 news is out," Mr. Hill says.=20
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i=
t to "sell" from "buy," with a brief stop at "hold." While she is the only =
analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her rece=
nt downgrades come "too little, too late."=20
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the co=
mpany's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives=
 are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance=
, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un=
der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said "no,=
" she says.=20
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC "inquiry," she=
 asked Enron about the previous denial. "They told me it is an inquiry, not=
 an investigation," she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned=
 of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.


Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

line on Thursday was above average levels.=20
Houston-based Enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it, a spokes=
woman said.=20
"We are making it clear that Enron has the full support of its banks and mo=
re than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our =
commitments in the ordinary course of business," Jeff McMahon, who took ove=
r Wednesday as chief financial officer, said in a written statement.=20
Enron said it recorded more than 8,300 transactions through EnronOnline on =
Thursday.=20
Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, said: "Enron continues to be=
 the market-maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets, our custome=
rs continue to put their confidence in us, and our core businesses are stro=
ng and performing well."=20
Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's=
 ratings, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Anatol Feygin described as "=
just more negative sentiment."=20
At one point in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, sh=
ares in Enron were up more than $1.50, but they closed down 6 cents at $16.=
35. As recently as Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84.=20
Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enro=
n, which currently holds investment-grade credit ratings, on review for a p=
ossible downgrade. Then after the market closed, Standard & Poor's took two=
 steps: It affirmed Enron's current ratings, but it also revised its long-t=
erm ratings outlook to negative.=20
Moody's Investors Service put all of Enron's long-term debt on review for p=
otential downgrade last week.=20
Enron, which noted that losing its investment-grade rating would take downg=
rades of three notches, said Thursday it will do everything in its power to=
 defend its current rating.=20
In the SEC inquiry, federal securities regulators are reviewing transaction=
s between Enron and two private investment partnerships formerly run by And=
rew Fastow, who was removed as Enron's chief financial officer Wednesday. E=
nron removed Fastow as part of its bid to repair its damaged credibility.=
=20
Wall Street is also questioning certain of Enron's financing vehicles and i=
s wondering whether the company will face hits to its balance sheet in the =
months ahead.=20
S&P said it was concerned that the sizable drop in Enron's market capitaliz=
ation has negatively affected its financial flexibility and could hurt the =
company's plans to rebuild its balance sheet.=20
But it also noted that the "fundamental strength" of Enron's energy marketi=
ng and trading business has remained steady.=20
Unless Enron's rebuilds confidence among investors and business partners, F=
itch said, it could "impair Enron's financial flexibility and access to cap=
ital markets," which would hurt its ability to conduct business.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, said the actio=
ns by S&P and Fitch might make some of Enron's energy customers skittish.=

Corporate US on track for bailout
DAVID GOW IN NEW YORK

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 1=
8bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just app=
roved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.=20
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three year=
s, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by =
the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amen=
dment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour cor=
porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and=
 Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt "new deal", prefer to see i=
ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects.=20
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on=
 Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn =
to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying l=
ittle or no tax.=20
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative=
 minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid=
 all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be mad=
e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded.=20
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calcul=
ate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone,=
 while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Doll=
ars 671m.=20
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's thi=
rd largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United=
 Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy=
 - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced t=
o sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m.=20
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dis=
like other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capi=
tal investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They =
say these amount to a "giant corporate giveaway".=20
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would h=
elp companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs=
 and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely t=
o start in the new year.=20
"Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner =
down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of wo=
rking families," the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of Cali=
fornia, said.=20
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's=
 provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Do=
llars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of st=
ates.=20
* A fresh round of global trade talks is essential to revitalise the world =

Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws=
 and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy?=20
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he =
is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Ins=
titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead=
ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's =
reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h=
is predecessor.=20
>From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a =
respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing wa=
y.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no =
doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev=
en the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt=
's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement acti=
on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t=
o report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one=
 could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a =
fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised qu=
estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th=
an a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the ac=
counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff me=
mber, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer.=20
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is goi=
ng to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is crea=
te an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C=
. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.''=20
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client t=
o restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, a=
re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much i=
n favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview=
, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state=
ments and restatements.''=20
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which woul=
d certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more ag=
gressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like =
a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors=
 who try to resist misleading accounting.=20
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization =
that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pi=
tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence.=20
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess a=
t Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. I=
t will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accountin=
g was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai=
n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi=
th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer=
.=20
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whe=
ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur=
es.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDT
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html>
TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse.=20
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J=
ames Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company "will pe=
rish" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have wors=
ened since the terrorist attacks. "Today, we are literally hemorrhaging mon=
ey," he wrote.=20
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL =
(UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders=
 have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,0=
00 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expecte=
d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings.=20
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeli=
ng that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24=
% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, =
UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti=
es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one un=
ion have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked.=20
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but s=
ometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either=
. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise.=20
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War=20
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an=
nihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so=
me DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car?=20
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that C=
ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef=
forts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded=
 the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco=
nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. "The economy is per=
haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa=
r on global terrorists," says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. "Wa=
r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."=20
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just su=
perfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savin=
gs bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t=
he federal government.=20
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war =
bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the =
same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bo=
nds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books.=20
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - co=
mmentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, =
following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. =
Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the =
company on what's delicately termed a "leave of absence."=20
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly =
reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol=
vement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake =
of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowle=
dged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confid=
ence.=20
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disincli=
nation to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure "unse=
ttling," noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the =
day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase,=
 Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And th=
ere could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission h=
as issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions.=20
4. Gold Diggers=20
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately=
, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. Accordin=
g to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty preci=
ous-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, =
with net inflows of $101 million.=20
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, dur=
ing the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion.=
 But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is notew=
orthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long.=20
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of =
a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.=
08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an e=
mbarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody=
's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same =
period, they were up 7.13%.=20
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades=
 -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't =
seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in=
 prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Se=
pt. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will co=
nfront disappointment once again.=20
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become pro=
fitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma oper=
ating profit.=20
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in lon=
g-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit=
 is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningle=
ss aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn a=
n economic profit.=20
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announci=
ng the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren =
Jenson added the humble qualifier, "There are no guarantees." Amazon simult=
aneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that s=
ales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago=
.=20
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slig=
htly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core =
books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made p=
rogress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses =
have decreased by 20% over the past year.=20
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made th=
e belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% =
from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget an=
d SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to "neutral" from prev=
ious buy ratings. "We thought there might be upside to our estimates," note=
d Blodget. "There wasn't."=20

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled=
 the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pa=
ir of grim economic reports.=20
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly=
 well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from=
 Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in th=
ird-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversi=
ng an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29,=
 to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99=
.=20
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the=
 fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in re=
cent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good=
 news regarding individual companies.=20
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raise=
d its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarde=
d the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several o=
ther parts of the energy sector along with it.=20
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed =
its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from=
 within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69.=20
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 4=
4 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-s=
torage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54.=20
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measu=
re also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a =
$100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrori=
st attacks on the economy.=20
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily o=
n the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American Int=
ernational Group and WorldCom.=20
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth=
 consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 perc=
ent dip many analysts had forecast.=20
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americ=
ans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, t=
he second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally a=
ssociated with recessions.=20
Other Indicators=20
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the Ame=

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=
ty

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available=
 bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strengt=
h and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 bill=
ion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- accordi=
ng to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide=
 a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks =
about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the mov=
es were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidit=
y should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last f=
ew days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," sa=
id an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief fin=
ancial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we=
 are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than =
adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitme=
nts."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's=
 largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all elec=
tricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved i=
n about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has report=
ed a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity =
of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commiss=
ion is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it di=
d with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow=
, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch=
, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors chang=
ed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Servic=
e has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall =
below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several no=
tches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, E=
nron shares were down six cents at $16.35.=20

As Enron's woes unnerve investors about energy sector, analysts say its pro=
blems are isolated

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest =
natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto ba=
rometer of health within the energy trading sector.=20
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on=
 the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, execu=
tives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and fre=
e-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector.=
 They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolatio=
n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
"The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was =
yesterday, a week ago or a month ago," said Jim Donnell, president of Duke =
Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and tr=
ades power.=20
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy In=
c., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday,=
 when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i=
ts rivals.=20
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 p=
ercent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim=
e soon.=20
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earning=
s, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were n=
ot entirely forthcoming only got worse.=20
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnersh=
ips managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. =
That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off=
 an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow=
, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence.=20
"They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test=
 and they didn't come through with flying colors," said Christopher Ellingh=
aus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York.=20
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have=
 little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts =
for roughly 80 percent of profits.=20
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa=
ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices.=
=20
"Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is sti=
ll sound and not likely to disappear," Ellinghaus said.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment.=20
"The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is o=
verdone," Barone said.=20
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income o=
f $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million =
in profits.=20
"It's business as usual," said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel.=20
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when =
its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The dow=
nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from =
power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief=
 executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter,=
 taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses,=
 troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earne=
d $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep=
t. 30.=20
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesd=
ay because of "dire" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that=
 it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of r=
eceivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy.=20
"All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality," Ellin=
ghaus said.=20
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday.=20
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying clo=
se attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication o=
f receivables not being paid.=20
"They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to=
 credit," he said. "They've never missed a deadline."

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)
2001-10-25 18:59 (New York)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)
2001-10-25 19:38 (New York)

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will clos=
e down its trading offices in London and Singapore over the next six months=
.=20
Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees =
overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asi=
an and European bandwidth trading operations at the company's Houston headq=
uarters.
"It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out=
 there in the market now," Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie Jame=
s said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires.=20
The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Sing=
apore office has 15 or fewer employees.=20
Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U=
.S., James said. She didn't know how many of the employees are U.S. citizen=
s. She didn't know what options might be offered to the non-American employ=
ees.=20
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices.=
=20
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that inter=
national bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market.=20
Earlier this year, as the U.S. market went sour, Enron executives had said =
that European and Asian telecommunications carriers might be more open to b=
andwidth trading, making the markets in those regions ripe for growth.=20

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to tradin=
g partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conferenc=
e call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California ab=
out renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the=
 company signed with the state earlier this year.=20
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share =
compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's co=
nsistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conferen=
ce call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, li=
ke Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric =
power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of=
 the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this=
 week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t=
o Enron.=20
"We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net expo=
sure to Enron," said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management,=
 Paul Pasoli. "We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit th=
reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."=20
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha=
lted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a litt=
le money.=20
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the sta=
te of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars=
 of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under=
 those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th=
an when California bought this past winter and spring.=20
"Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont=
racts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t=
o do so as well," said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. "If there=
 are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be =
happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."=20
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its p=
rogram to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is abo=
ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capac=
ity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d=
ifference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said tha=
t difference, or "spark spread," has grown the past few months. Furthermore=
, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr=
ojects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment.=20
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually thr=
ough 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and w=
on't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.=20

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp=

PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Ko=
droff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the=
 United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston D=
ivision, against defendants Enron Corporation ("Enron" or the "Company") (N=
YSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behal=
f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu=
ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").=20
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=
 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=
anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=
ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=
ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=
 operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=
ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=
y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =
success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=
 the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=
e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=
rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=
ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=
 on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=
rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=
arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the=
 third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,=
 Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=
ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =
by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=
g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=
f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =
price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,=
 Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron=
 common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no late=
r than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this =
class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, th=

rivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume th=
at the class member(s) with the "largest financial interest" in the outcome=
 of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discre=
tion in determining which class member(s) have the "largest financial inter=
est," and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both ab=
solute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained =
substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please cont=

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit t=
o provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion.=20
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has "more than adeq=
uate" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and =
it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain it=
s long-term credit rating.=20
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook f=
or Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in=
 market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair =
plans to rebuild the balance sheet.=20
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative =
news from the company.=20
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.=
35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Averag=
e daily volume is 7,832,606 shares.=20
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, re=
sulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billi=
on reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminati=
ng certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed=
 by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.=20
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediatel=
y.=20

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe En=
ron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock.=20
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks,=
 much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 di=
sclosure of the $1.01 billion charges.=20
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage po=
ints above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3=
 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-gra=
de credit, that kind of "spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with=
 a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said.=20
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downg=
rade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this wee=
k.=20
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have conc=
erns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in poli=
cy concerning the company.=20
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they have=
n't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about =
a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets.=20
The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with=
 rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.=

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

no thanks necessary - you have done a great job - now keep it up.  The courts are going to rule if some bonuses can be paid out - there are no guarantees, so I would not count on them approving it.  They are supposedly negotiating to have us stay on 5 & 6.  Nothing really new on those fronts.

There were a few more questions that I had about the new developments but i figured it would be easier than going to a conference room to talk about it...
 
First of all, i am glad that i get to remain in this group of people...i think that there could be plenty of good opportunities surface from this.  Second, i appreciate you, or whoever it was that chose me, having the confidence and faith in my ability to get the job done.  I definitely take that as a compliment and a challenge to continue to perform well. Who was it that bought us?  Didn't you mention something about going to the courts looking for money for performance bonuses for those of us who are continuing on to SwapCo?  How soon will we know if we'll be able to remain in the same building?  
 
that's about all that i can think of...if you get any more news today, please send it my way too...

 
See you Monday...

This book simply replaces a book that we were officializing for position purposes only.  We have a separate gas daily calc that is for value that goes into our P&L.  Nothing has changed with that book.  Please shout with anymore questions.  Thanks.

Subject:	RE: Estate

Just a couple of points that I am not sure I mentioned to you:

1.	I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease the
house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville.  She
obviouly has not done that.

2.	The day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to
take to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in
Daddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his
estate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and had
not been formally appointed.

3.	Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him to
pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm
surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.

With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to
court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:

1.	The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are put
back in to the estate.

2.	The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.

3.	The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her
distribution.

4.	The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in April
1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of the
estate.

5.	If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's
death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.

6.	Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as
executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.

7.	Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me and my
family.

I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am willing
to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's
death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as his.  I
will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy left
to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while he
was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay the
value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car for,
but that she did not put in the estate.

I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been very
busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need a
new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.

I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.

I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called his
office as recent as today.  The petition for removal is ready to sign but I
have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of filing
as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you
familiar with Wyatt Howell or his firm.  That is the firm I would like to
associate.  Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Darla and I tried to go out on the livelink to view some, but it errored on us and wouldn't let us view them.  I have also requested assistance from Mark Thorne that handles the physical files to see if he can help, but have not heard back from him.  If you have another way of getting a copy you might try it as I am not having much luck today.  The only other thing I have was a copy of the tariff and if you want it let me know.

Subject:	FW: Nicor Hub contracts

It has been Sylvia's understanding that Nicor Gas Company is a hub which is a storage facility, not the inverse.  We believe there has been a misinterpretation as to what has been stated.  In fact, these contracts have been setup since 1995.


Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.


 << File: Nicor Gas Company Contracts.xls >>  << File: Northern Illinois Gas Company.xls >> 


These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.


We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.  


If you need our assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Thank You.

That will be good going forward if all goes well, however we still need to address the outstanding issues in order to clear the Receivables and Payables.  I will be giving Marlene a copy of the tariff and see if she can get contracts setup.

We are changing how we put in these tickets effective November 1 to be on CPR exchange tickets.  When I get my reports for October we will go out and set up storage contracts for what we have right now and start using them accordingly.  Part of the problem has been in the way we have to send Nicor on an EDI process.  I am going to revisit and see if we can test in stage doing it thru CPR tickets and if that works then there should be no problem.  Please keep me posted and anything I can do to be of assistance please let me know.

Subject:	Nicor Hub contracts

We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James

I think there is also some stuff under a subsidiary of NICOR, Northern Illinois.  Make sure both are included.  If you guys can get the balances and which deal numbers are outstanding I think we can match up with the CPR reports that I have.

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

I have never heard of this location.  I only see a basis and index curve for this, no intra month, Storey has this location in his curve file.  We have no deals at this location.  Does Canada?  We do not do the pub posting on Mich_CG-GD, rates does this one.  I would think they should post the NGI as well.

My thoughts exactly about Woody.

What kind of camera did you get?

>>> <Phillip.M.Love@enron.com> 01/04/02 10:49AM >>>
I hope it is not Woody, Vandy sucked at offense and defense.  He is
horrible and I would hope we would go after somebody else.  We need to
get
someone in there soon so they can put the offense/defense in and the
players can start studying it to get a head start on next year.  I am
afraid if Tubby doesn't turn it around next year he may be gone.

I got a digital camera for Christmas that works real well, I will get
some
pictures to you.

   To read the articles about Auburn, Tubberville says HE made the
decision
   they should go.  Yeah, right!  I'm sure he was told by Lowder that
   either they went or he did.  So, they were given the opportunity to
   resign, and both chose to do so.  There's already 3 or 4 candidates
to
   replace each.  They expect to have the offensive guy in the next 2
   weeks.  Maybe a little longer for the defense.  Only remember 1
name:
   Woody Weidenhofer from Vandy for offense.  Can't say that I've ever
   heard of the others.

   Oh well, we'll see how it all pans out.

   Thanks for the address.  I'll send the picture soon.

Subject:	Updating Curve Files for Netco Environment

The curve files for Netco will need to be modified before they are used in the new environment.


    1)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to ermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7525
Change the Network Address on the 5th row to ;239.44.16.1;     

2) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

3)	Save your curves as normal

4)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11 letters in the name
"David Pawson!" I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a few weeks.
Wait a sec ... just realized "YOU CAN'T HIDE" also has 11 letters! What
am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after me! ME! I can't
believe it! Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet Earth I could
hide! But no ... PLANET EARTH" has 11 letters, too!  Maybe Nostradamus can
help me. But dare I trust him? There are 11 letters in "NOSTRADAMUS." I
know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't... 11 letters in "THE RED
CROSS," can't trust them. I would rely on self defense, but "SELF DEFENSE"
has 11 letters in it, too! Can someone help?  Anyone? If so, send me email.
No, don't... "SEND ME EMAIL" has 11 letters....

Will this never end? I'm going insane! "GOING INSANE???" Eleven letters!!
Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even though "I'LL DIE ALONE" has
11 letters.....  Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed! Our
Independence Day is July 4th ... 7/4 ... 7+4_!

      PS. "IT'S BULLSHIT" has 11 letters also.

I noted that there is a PHY book which is receiving a PostID, but I do not know if it has any active deals against it.  Please consider that in order to SUSPEND a CPID there can be no active deals in any deal entry system.  If we can not archive all Risktypes then we can not "SUSPEND" the CPID.  Please read the information below in the original document for additional data.

Subject:	Books marked as "To be Archived" on RAC Active/Inactive website
Importance:	High

All:

Attached please review a detail of books marked as "To be Archived" on the Active/Inactive website.  These books have already been archived on RisktRAC, so no positions will be captured going forward.  In order to close the Risk Loop we need to have these counter parties SUSPENDED on the various deal entry systems.  By changing the status of the Counter party codes we do not impact the data related to these counter parties.  The data will still be there and edits of existing deals will be allowed, however no new deals would be allowed for these counter parties.


Please review the list of books and send an email approving the status change to "SUSPENDED" on the deal entry systems for the books related to your own Business Units.  Please note that in order to "SUSPEND" the counter party code all risk types for that code must be suspended (i.e. IDX,BAS,PRC,GDL,GDI & PHY).  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at ext 54751.


Due to the urgent nature of this request, I kindly ask that you reply by Friday Oct 5 or at your earliest convenience.   


Thank you for your time and assistance in completing this task.



Regards,



Nancy

If you or your group have trouble printing, it may be that they moved a bunch a printers to \\nahou-psecn01v server. If you are on the the old server, you have to delete that printer from your printer set up and reinstall it by going through Start/run and typing in \\nahou-psecn01v, then select your printer.

Isn't it crazy.  Someone is selling a risk management book that they gave us in a class here for $900.  Unbelievable.  I am putting stuff out there tomorrow when it comes in.  We have a signature shop here that we can buy that same sleeve of balls for $4.

Phillip ... greetings from Auburn, where in 9 days the eagle will fly, the
stadium will rock and the tigers will welcome ball state to our newly named
"jungle."

WE have this week received the $12,500 matching money from Enron.

Also, can you email me your work number again. I think the dean of the vet
school wants to call and say thanks for setting up the scholarship.

I still have you on my calendar for a tour of the raptor center on Friday,
Oct. 12, the day before we (am I getting giddy here?) shock the number one
ranked gators.

   Subject:  RE: Estate

   Just a couple of points that I am not sure I mentioned to you:

   1.      I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease
   the
   house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville.  She
   obviouly has not done that.

   2.      The day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to
   take to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in
   Daddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his
   estate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and
   had
   not been formally appointed.

   3.      Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him
   to
   pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm
   surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.

   With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to
   court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:

   1.      The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are
   put
   back in to the estate.

   2.      The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.

   3.      The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her
   distribution.

   4.      The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in
   April
   1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of
   the
   estate.

   5.      If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's
   death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.

   6.      Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as
   executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.

   7.      Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me
   and my
   family.

   I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am
   willing
   to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's
   death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as
   his.  I
   will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy
   left
   to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while
   he
   was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay
   the
   value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car
   for,
   but that she did not put in the estate.

   I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been
   very
   busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need
   a
   new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.

   I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.

   I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called
   his

   but I
   have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of
   filing
   as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you

Now that we know which traders will be moving over, or we should, we need to make a second pass at the EOL product list.  Can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct, and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon?

Be sure to visit this  sight.  It is very well done.  Some of you know
Jamie Wax  and  others will have heard the name Taranto because Darlene,
who taught Hank and  Mamie and will, hopefully, teach Mak in 5th grade is
Paul's wife.  Paul and  Jamie wrote the musical "Evangeline" (based on the
Acadian story of Evangeline).   The music is from that play.

I have seen several tributes -- but this one is really special.  New photos
of the WTC
disaster - such an unbelievable nightmare.  Take a few minutes to watch
this.  It's worth it.
-- Jarja

A  guy in Baton Rouge -- Mason Wood -- put together this incredible
montage of the images from 9/11/01 that is incredibly poignant and well
presented.  You've got to see it to appreciate it.  It is set to music
written by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto from the musical "Evangeline".
They didn't realize what a profoundly appropriate backdrop it
would make to express a country's sentiments.  Put it on and turn it
up!  Then send this on.  I did.

I really would like to see the contract to verify things are not being booked correctly.  I spoke with Patrice and she does agree that we should not have a large receivable balance.  Try and get me the contract and I will see what I can do.  Thanks.

Subject:	FW: Nicor Hub contracts

It has been Sylvia's understanding that Nicor Gas Company is a hub which is a storage facility, not the inverse.  We believe there has been a misinterpretation as to what has been stated.  In fact, these contracts have been setup since 1995.


Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.


 << File: Nicor Gas Company Contracts.xls >>  << File: Northern Illinois Gas Company.xls >> 


These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.


We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.  


If you need our assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Thank You.

That will be good going forward if all goes well, however we still need to address the outstanding issues in order to clear the Receivables and Payables.  I will be giving Marlene a copy of the tariff and see if she can get contracts setup.

Let me know how the test goes.

We are changing how we put in these tickets effective November 1 to be on CPR exchange tickets.  When I get my reports for October we will go out and set up storage contracts for what we have right now and start using them accordingly.  Part of the problem has been in the way we have to send Nicor on an EDI process.  I am going to revisit and see if we can test in stage doing it thru CPR tickets and if that works then there should be no problem.  Please keep me posted and anything I can do to be of assistance please let me know. 

Thanks,

Cora

Subject:	Nicor Hub contracts

We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James

Attached is a file from EOL that has all the current products.  We are trying to do a mass mapping for the systems of all of these products.  As you mentioned, not all of these products will roll out initially, but we wanted to go ahead and map them in the system.  I have put in the old trader's names in a column(column F).  If you could check out the list when you get a chance and let me know if you want to change the traders on any of the products and who will be trading the products for the traders that are not moving over(names highlighted in green).  Also, there are no current products under Jason Wolfe, Matt Smith or Jane Tholt.  Please let me know if we need to create products for them or if we will be moving existing ones to them.  Please also let me know which traders need to also have a physical book.  The list I gave you this morning is the financial books we set up.  Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Phillip

Melba and I just noticed there are two lone liquidations for Texex Energy Partners Ltd for August 2001 production that are linked to Sitara deals that say they are for August 2002.  Which year is correct?


Sitara 848155	August 2002	Tagg VG6573.1	August 2001
Sitara 848158	August 2002	Tagg VG6577.1	August 2001

The exposure on these two liquidations together would be $67,911	expense to the desk.

Let me know what we should do.

Thanks
Cathy

standard reply is that we will be working on the last day and no one knows what it will be like.  Make a reservation and we will do our best to get you out.  The problem is I am sure everyone wants to get out for New Year's Eve so you might generate hard feelings.  I have nothing to do because I consider it to be the most dangerous night of the year and I always stay home.  You decide what you want to do and we will work around it.  If you stay here, I have always heard the Hyatt has a great party and room rate all included.  I am sure other hotels have the same.

Can you please review these archived RisktRAC book ids and determine if we can archive this CPID.  I noted that there is a PHY book which is receiving a PostID, but I do not know if it has any active deals against it.  Please consider that in order to SUSPEND a CPID there can be no active deals in any deal entry system.  If we can not archive all Risktypes then we can not "SUSPEND" the CPID.  Please read the information below in the original document for additional data.

All:

Attached please review a detail of books marked as "To be Archived" on the Active/Inactive website.  These books have already been archived on RisktRAC, so no positions will be captured going forward.  In order to close the Risk Loop we need to have these counter parties SUSPENDED on the various deal entry systems.  By changing the status of the Counter party codes we do not impact the data related to these counter parties.  The data will still be there and edits of existing deals will be allowed, however no new deals would be allowed for these counter parties.


Please review the list of books and send an email approving the status change to "SUSPENDED" on the deal entry systems for the books related to your own Business Units.  Please note that in order to "SUSPEND" the counter party code all risk types for that code must be suspended (i.e. IDX,BAS,PRC,GDL,GDI & PHY).  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at ext 54751.


Due to the urgent nature of this request, I kindly ask that you reply by Friday Oct 5 or at your earliest convenience.   


Thank you for your time and assistance in completing this task.



Regards,



Nancy

I wouldn't expect anything.  I am sure everyone will move over as a lateral.  They may do retention packages, but I have not heard anything.

SO, have you heard anything about pay changes.  I am just wondering if certain of us can expect pay raises.  Maybe that is greedy for someone who could get fired, but i am just wondering.

Do you mind sending this guy that mouse pad on the desk?  Thanks.  The priority mail boxes are behind the filing cabinet in the office, you will need to use one of the larger ones.  I would stuff it with newspaper or something like that to keep it from sliding around.

Please also remember to email your goals for the next six months so that we can work on making sure you meet those objectives.  Thanks.

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

I wish you would come back - it would give our stock price a shot in the arm...press release...DK is back at work!!  I will talk with DG and get with you on a date, we are pretty busy around the holidays, maybe we can hit something up during the week.  Does Gary get home at a decent time during the week?

we should be in Auburn in plenty of time for lunch, but I would like to get

flight delays.  We arrive in Atlanta at about 9:30 auburn time and should
be to Auburn well before noon, but with everything going on, I an not sure
of our arrival time.  Looking forward to it.

   I checked with Joe ... 1 p.m. will work fine.  Our new $500,000 worth of
   construction will be finished and in use by then, so I'm really looking
   forward to showing you the place.

   If you guys would like to get together for lunch before that, Chuck's
   barbecue is right around the corner from the Raptor Center.  I could
   meet
   you there.  Let me know.  Just learned our Miss State game will be on

   You are right, that game was very difficult to watch.

   I know we were scheduled to take a tour around 3 p.m.  I was wondering
   if
   we could move it up to around 1 p.m.  We are going to be getting into
   Auburn before lunch time on Friday and we have some friends coming that
   have never been to Auburn and we would really like them to see the
   Raptor
   Center.  Even if Tiger is not going to be there, we would still like to
   have a look if that is feasible for you.  Maybe if we move it up to 1,
   she
   will still be there.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks and look
   forward
   to seeing you in a couple of weeks.

   War Eagle.

      Phillip ...  hope all is well there in Houston.  We are still
   wondering
      what we ran into at the Carrier Dome.  I thought Lawrence Taylor had
      retired, but apparently he is still playing and wears number 54 for
      Syracuse.

      In any event, I have learned that the School of Nursing is having a
   fund
      raising event on Friday, Oct. 12, from late afternoon through the
      evening,
      and Joe Shelnutt will be taking War Eagle to that event.  That of
   course
      means he and  Tiger won't be at the Raptor Center at the time we had
      planned to go out there.

      Do you guys want to try it on another trip to Auburn?

That is cool . The price per loaf in SD is about $ 2.95 at Cost co . The
soup would be a good idea
as it is starting to get cold. I think we tried on line and it had to be
bought in the store.

We have actually been able to find that bread here at Sam's, so we are
absolutely set man.  If they stop selling it, we can get it over the
internet, it is just a little pricier.  You need to get us to start buying
it here and shipping to you man - Sam's has it for less than $4 a loaf.  I
think Ashley said it is close to $6 in San Diego.  We still need to get you
some soup don't we?

   We went to the game.  unfortunately, I picked up a cold from being out
   in
   the rain all night Friday and Saturday, but we had a blast.  A win cures
   everything.

   We are now ranked #20, we were previously unranked.  Where did you guys
   go
   camping?  Do you rough it all the way?  My idea of camping is watching
   TV

Darron,

Please confirm the following:
1. I can't find the book ENA-WT-SOCAL in Estate database (please provide the CP ID)
2. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PRICE (CP ID 11360)
3. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PR-OPT (CP ID 92649)
4. Commodity code: NG or NGGJ?
5. Please provide the cutoff date to determine active deals (e.g. instr_end_dt > ? 1-jan-2002?)
6. Use ENA CP ID 1305 as the other side counterparty?

If I can have all the answers soon then I think the deals move can be completed around 3:00p.m.

Thanks,
Cecilia

Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.

The books are FT-INT-CEN-MKT2-BAS,GDI,GDL,IDX,PRC and INTRA_CNT-MKT2-PHY.  Jim should not need to be set up in the system, because he was in Chicago, he should just need books added.

I have set up the new basis curves for West and the are based off the old curves, so they are in the old format.  They are located in the Netco Directory under west/curves/CA BASIS NEW and WEST BASIS NEW.  I am still working on GDY and Phy/GD.  The Phy/GD is in the new format and will be located in the same directory as the above, with the title West phys curves.  GDY will be in the same location as filename West GDY and it is also in the new format.  The phys/GD file will be complete tomorrow and the GDY will be done today.

Subject:	TDS Curve File Upgrades

Due to changes to the database relative to the change to "Netco", the curve files will need to be upgraded.  The majority of the files
will be able to be upgraded by each individual with a minimal of effort.  Older files will take extra effort.  Can you have your people 
identify how many old files we have.  The old files can be identified by looking at the "Publish" tab in the Admin box located at F2:G3.

The old files will only have the button  (Reset Rows/Columns)

The new files will have 3 buttons   (Reset Rows/Columns)
                                                  (Load Modules)(Re Init)


Knowing which files still have the old format will help the IT group plan for this migration.
If you could have your people check and get back to me as soon as possible, I would appreciate it.

Thanks
Russ

The only FT-Central-Opt book that should move to her is the GDL.  The others should remain with Geoff Storey.  She also needs to have the INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY book.  Sorry for the mistake.

Please set up Souad Mahmassani in risktrac.  She is a new trader on the central desk.  She will be running the Aruba and central transport books.  The following books will be her responsibility:
ARUBA-SPLY-PRC
ARUBA-TP-PHY
FT-PEOPLES-BAS,PRC,IDX,GDL
FT-CENTRAL-OPT-BAS,GDL,IDX,PRC

Souad would need to roll up to the Central desk in natural gas, I would say she should be set up similar to Denver Plachy.

Please shout with any questions or additional information that you may need.  Thanks.

These pictures are from an accident that involved an 18 wheeler carrying
fuel through Birmingham.  Supposedly, a car trying to exit onto an off ramp
cut in front of the truck from an interior lane.  The rear quarter panel of
the car hit the truck sending it out of control.  The driver of the car was
not injured, but sadly, the truck driver died when the load exploded.  Here
are the results of the fire to the roadway.  Unbelievable!

thanks.  FYI - we will have a pretty big book move for you around lunch tomorrow and need it before 3:30 if possible.  We will be moving third party financial deals(ENA is the Enron counterparty) from NG-PRICE to ENA-FT-WC-SJ.  I will get you the list before lunch tomorrow, just thought you could get started on the script.  Thanks again.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Enron's Lay could get $80M from deal 
Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.
The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.
Enron's shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.

According to our benchmark guys up here, it looks like the Central Transport GDL book did not make it into risktrac under souad.  The book is named FT-Central-opt-gdl.  I also should have asked you to send the FT-Peoples-GDI book over to Souad.  It appears that the remaining FT-Central-Opt- books (PRC,BAS,IDX) are under Martin Cuilla, these should be under Geoff Storey.  Can you please make these changes.  Thanks for all of your help.

Can you map the following three curves to Omicron curves.  Nilay did his side and I need you to do the other side according to the IT guys.
GDP-St.CLAIR		Omicron 14
GDP-NGPL(IA-IL	Omicron 11
GDP-MONCHY		Omicron 11

Can you let me know when this is done so that I can get Souad's VaR rerun.  Thanks for your help.  You also need to let me know if you guys can go to lunch on me on Friday.

I checked with Phillip Love and he said that it will be its own book, but that it needs to remain inactive until we start putting deals into it.  He just wants the book set up so that we can start putting deals in when we're ready.

Attached is a file with the CP's that are terminated per Kim's list and had been sent to IT to move to the bankruptcy book.  There are six CP's on this list.  I will send the legal names to Cecilia to get these moved today(with 7,000 lines, I am afraid it would take at least a day for risk to move manually).  We will then recheck the book tonight.  As you will see on the summary page, the total value of these deals is $(61.6M).  If there are any questions, please let me know, I will bring hard copies to the 11a.m. meeting.  Thanks.

Jim Simpson has moved from the Chicago office to the Houston office.  He will be taking over the Mich-CG book.  We need to have the books transferred from Hunter Shively to Jim Simpson. The books are FT-INT-CEN-MKT2-BAS,GDI,GDL,IDX,PRC and INTRA_CNT-MKT2-PHY.  Jim should not need to be set up in the system, because he was in Chicago, he should just need books added.  Thanks for all of your help.

Just wanted to send you an FYI - due to problems that are caused for RAC, please roll your P&L's each day from your daily file and not the regions file.  The RAC group looks at our P&L's in the region files each morning to determine rho and drift and this causes a problem if you have saved your P&L after rolling(it appears as though you have data already captured for current day because it copies and pastes formulas from the prior day to current day).  Thanks for your help and shout with any questions.

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.  I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.  Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

thanks for your help.  Due to my lack of a complete understanding of VaR, can you give me a lesson if you find out exactly why.  All I have ever changed are the correlations.  Thanks.

I think that the correlations for the points in the Aruba book must be different.  Her position is 5 contracts long in the book and her VaR is $500K.  Is there any way you can tell me the correlations that are being used for the points that she has positions at in that book?  The pub codes are : IF-NNG/VENT, NGI/CHI. GATE, CHI./N/BORDER, NGPL-IOWA0ILLIN,UF-NGPL/OK-NW, NGI/CHI./PEOPLE,NGI/CHI./NIPSCO,ML7/CG.  Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

FYI - the west is wanting to split the region into two regions.  Stephen, I know you have been working on mapping the P&Ls for reporting purpose, the attached file breaks down those two regions.  We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

I just wanted to thank you again for the great tour we had on Friday.  Everyone talked about it all weekend and we look forward to the expanding projects at the raptor center and hope to be able to help in those efforts.  It was great meeting you and I look forward to talking to you again in the future.

Can you send me another component VaR on Souad Mahmassani.  It looks like the fix we put in place did not work, her VaR is still over 400K.  Thanks for your help.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Sorry you could not open it, it was a pretty funny PowerPoint slide.  Your brother still has not responded to my email.  I talked with your dad last night, I think we are going to be hitting dinner with them in the next week before they head out of town.  Hope pregnancy is going well.

Please pass on the condolences of another part of the Auburn family to Mr. Walker.  We are all truly hurt by the passing of his mother.  From the recent articles I have read in the Alabama papers, it appears she was a phenomenal mother and friend.  We were also pleased to see his positive comments regarding his teammates, fellow students and alumni of Auburn.  The auburn spirit is special and it means a lot to those of us who spent time there to hear current players and students share the same beliefs.  We are sure he will continue to honor his mother and her memory by his outstanding play on the field and dedication in the classroom.  Thank you Mr. Walker for making us all proud to be an Auburn Tiger.  Please respond via email to let us know if the University or anyone else has set up a memorial fund or scholarship in her name.  We would really like to donate money in her name.  Thanks and War Eagle.


The Love Family
Dianne, Phillip and Ashley

Well, I hope everyone is having a save and fun holiday season.  The good
news is that I got a digital camera so there will be a lot more pictures
available on the family album.  The bad news is that I got a digital
camera and there will be a LOT more pictures available on the family
album. ;)

Anyways, its been update from Christmas, check back after the new year
as there will probably be more from our trip to the desert this weekend.

yes 21st is cool.  Just use this as a time to help out and do any projects that come up and use up all of your vacation - doubt it will be there to carryover.  As far as I know, our employment status has not changed - we have made no changes to the "list".  I would not worry for now.

The only books that should still have deals in them, other than NG-Price, will be 

Intra-Ont-Cad		all canadian gas daily deals
NGPR-Can
Oil-NG-Spec
Ft-Ont-Central		all consolidated price/basis deals

these books will still have to be calculated after today.

All counterparty deals were moved over the weekend but any remaining desk to desk deals were not touched.  We need to move those ourselves today.
All others need to be calculated and officialized one more time today then inactivated on the Rac website for tomorrow.

Monchy and NGPL-IA-IL should be mapped to chicago - omicron #11 and St. Clair should be mapped to omicron #14.  Do I need to also send this information to Burton in the controls group?

trip to steamboat:
Jan. 13-19 $425 a night for a house that sleeps 10.
That works out to $500 a couple for the week(6 nights).  That will give us 5 days to ski(or 4 on 1 off).
Continental flys directly to Steamboat for $300 roundtrip.
Need to know interest level ASAP. We have to pay 50% upon booking the house and %50 within 30 days of arrival.
I will pay the %50 up front, I just want a firm committment that you will be going.
Take a look at the house:

I am not sure if they have confirmed either deal.  However, deal #1034254 was never pathed by us, whereas 1027152 was.  Therefore, nothing billed out under 1034254.

Bonnie - I am including you on this note in case you can add anything about the pathing of the two deals mentioned in this note.  Niether CMS orgaination shows anything on Trunkline that matches this.  We spoke briefly about this last week.

Phillip - I am including you in case you can add any clarity or determine who we did this deal(s) with.

Thank you,

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

Phillip:
The accountant that took the Consumers account from me last month has left the company this week without getting them paid for October.  I am now trying to tie out their October invoice.  Please let me know the correct pricing for the deals below.  

Deal 1086060	Consumers billed all of the gas at 0.03.  We have various prices.  Consumers Contract 5030-82-99
Deal 1029516	Consumers billed 0.05.  We have 0.025.  Also, I think the sign is wrong on the price.  It should be negative.
		Contract 5030-82-97
Deal 1075510	Consumers billed 0.03.  We have 0.015.  Also, I think the sign is wrong on the price.  It should be negative.
		Contract 5030-82-96

Also, they billed us for contract 5030-82-98 which I do not see in the system --  2,000 @ 0.01.

There are also some deals in the system that Consumers did not bill us for, deals 1029566, 881687, and 1087206.  Please let me know what I should do with these.

I will not be in the office next week, so please respond to Lisa Valderrama.

Keith -

Anything in risktrac that is "-PHY" is intra-month.  Anything with "-PRC",  "-BAS", "-IDX", "-GDI",  are all "term" books.  There are some rules around "-GDL" where it is intra-month for all but two days at the end of each month.

The OIL-NG (Lavo's) book would only have internal deals.  That may be why his book is not in credit.  Not really sure what the deal is with ARUBA-SPLY.  You should probably give Phillip Love a call.

Jeff-

I'm looking with the AGG-CREDIT portfolio to determine if the portfolio content is complete/correct.  In doing a comparison between AGG-CREDIT and AGG-PROD-DPR-BU, the following books are shown as active in AGG-PROD but not included in CREDIT.  Any thoughts on whether or not these should be included/excluded?  Based on the book id, I assume they are not intramonth - thus should likely be included.  

ARUBA-SPLY-PRC	US Gas Central		
OIL-NG-HDG-C-CA-GDL	US GAS Financial		

Separately I heard that there are books labeled as intramonth that include forward positions & vice versa forward books that contain intramonth positions.  Do you have a listing of these?

Thanks

Attached is a book request for two new books - one for Lavorato and one for Cuilla.  Due to the problems we had last week/this weekend that you guys helped us try and resolve, we are going to have to go the route of Canada on these Aeco deals and book a spreadsheet for VaR purposes.  Please set the two books up like Calgary's book(Sheet 1 on the attached file) We need to start doing this tonight, because Hunter and Lavorato want their VaR reported correctly tonight.  They both plan on altering their positions and utilizing all of their VaR.  I apologize for the short notice and appreciate all of your help so that I can get this fixed for tonight's VaR.  Please let me know any additional information I can provide you.  Thanks.

 FYI - not sure if you know this yet, but you need to become verified on PayPal before your payment can go through.  This usually entails you getting the two amounts from your bank account that they drafted - usually pennies.  Once you are verified, I will receive the funds and I will mail out the cube.  Thanks.

 What do you think about setting up a meeting between your group and mine in which each of us gives a short 15 minute presentation on what we do and how things other groups do affect our group.  If you think we will need more time, maybe we set up two meetings.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

we are not sure yet if we are going to copy these deals or simply move them completely to this new book(remove from old books).  You can move them to a new root portfolio if you want.  I do not know what that means though.

Phillip - Keith mentioned this morning that deals from existing books would be copied to the new bankruptcy books.  If so, this could cause a duplication problem.  Would it be safer to create a new root portfolio to place them under?  Please advise.

We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

As I am sure you are experiencing as well all the fire drills that are currently going on around here, I have been running since I got back from vacation.  Believe me when I say this is a high priority for me as well because of all the potential P&L fallout for the traders who have been entering this information.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

can you get me the info on August for Nicor, according to Cora Pendergrass I need to see august numbers because some of July's invoice has august volumes.  I would like a copy of all the stuff you guys gave me for July.  Thanks.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks 
Darla Saucier

I think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and I thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region.  These relate to fixed price lock ins with Peoples.  I think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month.  We will have to try and work on this for this month.  The problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled.  Sorry for the confusion.

Melba and Phillip,

What has changed on the Peoples region that would lead you to believe these deals that we previously determined to not belong on your desk for the months of June - August now in fact belong to your desk?  These deals are the same deals that represent the 3.8 MM adjustment that cleared off those three months.

Thanks,

Jim

I have tried to contact you guys three times today and have been on hold each time at least 20 minutes.  I cancelled my service with you over a month ago and asked that you keep from sending me a bill.  My service was cancelled immediately and I was told I would receive a bill from you and I would then have to call and dispute the bill to have my account credited.  I asked at that time since I had waited on hold that time for 30 minutes that this matter be taken care of immediately so that I would not have to call back and sit on hold again for half an hour.  Your customer service manager, very rudely I might add,  said that was impossible and I would just have to do it anyway.  Since I have had to wait on hold today for so long I want this email to serve as my dispute and have my account closed and the balance due removed since you terminated my service and I did not get the use of my phone.  

Just a word of advice, I would hire more customer service representatives if you plan on keeping customer to serve.  This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a company and I will make sure all of my colleagues and friends know of this experience.  I understand that you don't really care about giving good customer service to your ex customers, but I assure you make a fatal error when you assume those people will not share there experience with current and future potential customers.

Now that Sitara is systematically adding new locations to the attached swaps, do you still want to receive the email 
notifications or can we take you off the list.

Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.

sorry to keep bothering you.  It looks like Souad's VaR continues to go down, but her net positions 5 contracts and her VaR is over $300K.  Can you verify that it is her Aruba book that is causing all of the VaR.  She only has positions at about 5 locations and they should all be mapped to the same omicron curve and either NG or Chi. Gate.  I would think that there would not be that much difference between NG and Chi Gate.  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject:	League Dues

I have some good news and some bad news.  The good news is that I invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks.  The bad news is that I invested it in enron stock.  So, needless to say I am going to have to default on this year's payouts.  

Sorry guys

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

Subject:	MGU Update

This is an update to keep you posted on recent changes:

The October start has been waved-off.  November is now the firm target.  Russell is planning to have the contract executed a week from today, Oct 5th.

The Mich vs ML7 and Consumers vs ML7 basis spreads have been moved back into the main body of the summary sheet.  We are going to use those tickets.

Geoff said to drop the two NYMEX fuel hedge tickets.  He is not going to put that hedge on with the NYMEX desk.

The contract language hasn't evolved in a manner that supports the 2nd and 3rd winter Mich and Consumers FPPrgm.  Therefore, that volume will revert from FPPrgm to Mich index sale.

The treatment of summer injection cost still has not been resolved.  If MGU agrees to bear that cost adjustments will be required to our Mich index sale ticket.

There's probably more but that's all that come to mind right now.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I think that the correlations for the points in the Aruba book must be different.  Her position is 5 contracts long in the book and her VaR is $500K.  Is there any way you can tell me the correlations that are being used for the points that she has positions at in that book?  The pub codes are : IF-NNG/VENT, NGI/CHI. GATE, CHI./N/BORDER, NGPL-IOWA0ILLIN,UF-NGPL/OK-NW, NGI/CHI./PEOPLE,NGI/CHI./NIPSCO,ML7/CG.  Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

I am still here.  I have a contract through March 1 of next year, so I should be here at least until then.  The absolute destruction of the company has been pretty brutal - some of the people lost everything in their 401K.  I guess they really believed in the company.  We should still be in town in Feb. just let us know when the party is and we will be there.

have starting building a house and its going well.  I figure it will take
about a year to get it all done. I would like to do as much of the work
myself, but I will see how long that goes.  Anyway, The Family and myself
will be in Houston in late Feb.  We are having a small reception in Clear
Lake and would love to see yall there if you can make it.

Let me here from you soon, hope all is well with you and the family.

Tell your moms whats up from me.

Tommy

Bharat,

We never had to map curves to Omicron.  I thought that it was done by either RAC or IT.  What is the process?  Let's know ASAP so that VaR can be re-run.

Can you map the following three curves to Omicron curves.  Nilay did his side and I need you to do the other side according to the IT guys.
GDP-St.CLAIR		Omicron 14
GDP-NGPL(IA-IL	Omicron 11
GDP-MONCHY		Omicron 11

Can you let me know when this is done so that I can get Souad's VaR rerun.  Thanks for your help.  You also need to let me know if you guys can go to lunch on me on Friday.

Bharat asked that I forward this information to you.  Could you please map the following curves to the appropriate omicrons.  Monchy and NGPL-IA-IL should be mapped to chicago - omicron #11 and St. Clair should be mapped to omicron #14.  Do I need to also send this information to Burton in the controls group?

These are the unmapped curves.  Please let me know what OMICRONS they should be mapped to and I'll have Nilay do it.  This is your problem.  Large hedge benefits are not being captured in her books.

That is funny.  I just ordered some more to sell on EBay, I can buy four sleeves for $16.50 and they are going for $40 a sleeve on EBay.  You might want to sell them.  We were actually a skit last week on Saturday Night Live.  Pretty funny stuff.  Keep working on your wife about Jazz Fest.  Ash is working her too.

You guys are going to end up as a skit on Saturday Night Live. Also I forgot
to send you so love
for the Care Package. No golf course will let me on with them but that's ok.
I will put them
in my bag with my Firestone Golf balls.
Thanks again for the stuff.

You know you got me all fired up now, I am going to put on the full court press to keep the tradition alive.  I am attaching a map from El Cajon to Houston for driving directions.  They say it will take 24+hours, I calculated the time and I think the jilly mobile can do it in 20.  Ashley is probably going to drive the Burban over to NO and I am going to fly because of work.  So you guys only have to drive to Houston and she will do the rest.  Sounds like a good idea to me(yeah right).  I will even throw in a Love trip back to SD this summer/fall if I can get a visit in April.  Two for one baby, you can't get a deal better than that except at Costco.  Plus, I almost forgot the best part - we have a little TV for the burban so you could get a little MLB 2001 action on the way.....(give me enough time and I will keep it coming)

We are doing good. I hope all is well with all of the junk you are going
through.
It looks like Steve went out on top! I think that the Chargers are too cheap
to hire him. Emma
is doing great. I liked the pictures that Ash sent. Jackson has a hat on and
there is a joker
on a pogo stick. Also the picture of J Bug and Tory was great. Trying to
impress the
ladies with his musical talents. I think that the tradition may end this
year. I know that
if we came we would have to drive. Denise will not fly.
We are going to miss you this year. There will probably be some great acts.

Talk to you soon.

What is up my California buddy?  Staying out of trouble?  Things are going
pretty good here.  You believe Steve Spurrier?  IT is a great deal for
Auburn and the SEC.  Time for a new dog to get on top.  What is my little
friend Emma beans up to?  I bet she is growing and talking up a storm.  Are
you guys coming to the Fest this year?  Just to offer you a little
encouragement, I found a special fare for you out there on southwest non
stop both ways....here is the link.  Only $250 a person.  Let me know big
dog.  You know we can not have the tradition ended.

You gotta love LSU fans.  My brother told me a story of an Illinois fan who was bitching and moaning in the bathroom over his team's performance (and the fact that playing in the Superdome  equates to a home game for LSU - which is funny considering that the 20,000 fans that did show up in the dome would be considered a sellout in Champaign.)  Several Tiger fans jumped in the guys face, told him that Illinois sucks at every sport, called him a p---y, and took his orange shakers from his pocket, threw them into the urinal and pissed on them.  All to the delight of tens of Tiger fans yelling "Tiger Bait."  It could be the same fans that called Illinois Coach Ron Turner's room and yelled the same the night before the game.




given your love (jealousy) of LSU fans, i thought you'd find this amusing...

We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.  I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.  Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

If you feel like drowning your sorrows at the end of the world in some free keg beer, sodas and hard liquor - come down to Clear Lake and celebrate the fact that today may be the last paycheck you receive from Enron.  Playstation, pool, and darts(with pictures of great Enron leaders) will be available for your enjoyment.  You can also try chase the 3 year old with the dirty diaper.  Party starts about 7 ish.  We will order Pizza or something like that if you haven't eaten.  Directions:

Turn left under the freeway - heading east
You will travel roughly four miles (through 3 lights and two stop signs) turn left on Noble Pine(across from Children's World) 
When that street dead end's take a right on Towering Oak
Take first left onto Cherry Oak
That dead end's at Sterling Wood Way - take a left.
Third house of the right 4435 Sterling Wood Way

Here in lies the problem.  These fix price locks are not deal specific - rather counterparty specific.  Therefore, we can not modify prices until the end of the month when we know which deals flowed volumes and which did not.  This means we have to do this the last two days of the month along with all of the other things we are doing.  For every month since May - except September we have been able to do this.  It just so happens the one time we do not do it, we had the most locks.  The problems we had in previous months were due to liquidations hitting central that should have hit Chicago.  Same deals, different issues.  Thanks.

I think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and I thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region.  These relate to fixed price lock ins with Peoples.  I think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month.  We will have to try and work on this for this month.  The problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled.  Sorry for the confusion.

Melba and Phillip,

What has changed on the Peoples region that would lead you to believe these deals that we previously determined to not belong on your desk for the months of June - August now in fact belong to your desk?  These deals are the same deals that represent the 3.8 MM adjustment that cleared off those three months.

Thanks,

Jim

Dear Phillip-

In an effort to clean up RisktRAC, we have created a new hierarchy structure in RisktRAC that is currently in the testing phases.  I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the new hierarchy structure for Central Gas (please look at all the tabs).  Also included is a list of your books that are linked to the lowest level portfolio of the hierarchy structure.  

Could you please review the proposed hierarchy structure and let me know of any issues (i.e. all traders are captured or that we don't have any "extra" traders reflected.)  
Additionally, could you please review the "books" tab and ensure that the book list is complete and accurate and that the book is linked to the correct trader (please note - if more than one trader trades out of the same book, the book should be assigned to the most senior trader.  Please ensure that this has been done correctly).  Please advise us of any missing books as well.
Finally, I would like to get an understanding of what reports/hierarchies you all are currently using in RisktRAC and for what purpose.

 I would like a response ASAP, but by Monday at the latest.  Please call me to discuss at your convenience or email me your response.  Thanks, Phillip.

Christy

Stacey Richardson is researching additional transactions & we are receiving daily updates from legal regarding counterparties who have terminated either their agreements or specific transactions due to the bankruptcy. However, the deal count should begin to reduce.

Not the answer you were looking for, but the best I can give for today.

The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books. Please note that there are still several deals that I am trying to reconcile back to Sitara numbers. Assuming that I can do so, I will send supplemental information tomorrow afternoon.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Can you give me a list of all of the deals that have been put into Sitara for the Chicago office - the book/counterparty name will be Enovate.  The Arthur Anderson auditors have requested this information.  They are doing an audit of Enovate and want a list of all of the deals since the book started in order to get a sample size for their audit.  you should not have to go back farther than 01/00.

Philip,
I made a Paypal payment this morning.  All the shipping information on the

Subject:	New book requests for Canadian deals - VAR problems

Attached is a book request for two new books - one for Lavorato and one for Cuilla.  Due to the problems we had last week/this weekend that you guys helped us try and resolve, we are going to have to go the route of Canada on these Aeco deals and book a spreadsheet for VaR purposes.  Please set the two books up like Calgary's book(Sheet 1 on the attached file) We need to start doing this tonight, because Hunter and Lavorato want their VaR reported correctly tonight.  They both plan on altering their positions and utilizing all of their VaR.  I apologize for the short notice and appreciate all of your help so that I can get this fixed for tonight's VaR.  Please let me know any additional information I can provide you.  Thanks.

If you feel like drowning your sorrows at the end of the world in some free keg beer, sodas and hard liquor - come down to Clear Lake and celebrate the fact that today may be the last paycheck you receive from Enron.  Playstation, pool, and darts(with pictures of great Enron leaders) will be available for your enjoyment.  You can also try chase the 3 year old with the dirty diaper.  Party starts about 7 ish.  We will order Pizza or something like that if you haven't eaten.  Directions:
I - 45 South to exit 29 - CLC Blvd.
Turn left under the freeway - heading east
You will travel roughly four miles (through 3 lights and two stop signs) turn left on Noble Pine(across from Children's World) 
When that street dead end's take a right on Towering Oak
Take first left onto Cherry Oak
That dead end's at Sterling Wood Way - take a left.

I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called his

have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of filing

we flashed this as Union, they subsequently moved the volumes on GL to CPR pipeline exchange.  you have to look at both to get this to reconcile.  Does this make sense?  If not, give me a call.  Thanks.

I do have this deal under CPR Pipeline Exchange but if I move this $635,999 liquidation to Syn Strg I end up with a variance exposure of $1,237,227 on Syn Strg.  Our flash for Syn Strg is volume of (189,279) and ($1,058).  No volumes have been booked yet.  Should there be another liquidation?

looks like this deal got zeroed out and rebooked on #1019677 look and see if you see this - CP should now be CPR pipeline exchange.  No variance should occur.  Thanks.

Thanks for the EOL products email.  I am attaching the curve files. The CA Basis is the California markets and the West Basis is Rockies and SW.  The third file is the GDI curves.  Please review and let me know if we need to make any changes or additions to this file.  They are pretty simple and straightforward and do not link to anything currently.  Let me know what you think.  I am sending them in three different emails because of the size.  I will have the physical/GD curve file to you by Monday.  Thanks.

 What do you think about setting up a meeting between your group and mine in which each of us gives a short 15 minute presentation on what we do and how things other groups do affect our group.  If you think we will need more time, maybe we set up two meetings.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

and for those that are email challenged(Scott Palmer) you sent it twice.  Don't worry, we do not have to worry about O'Neal, Sunday is not daylight savings time.  I got them to move the tournament two weeks so we could count on O'Neal for the first game.

Our first game is at 9:00 with the TechnoSapiens on field #3. A map is attached. I paid the $10.00/person fee today. If you could give $10.00 between now and the tournament, I would appreciate it. 


Again, for those who have difficulty with the time of day (O'Neal), that was 9:00 am. See you there and let's have fun.

I apologize, we have been a little delinquent on the thank you cards this year, we are usually really good about it.  He got those horses and absolutely loves them.  We got him a fisher price farm for Christmas and he had just opened that when he opened the horses.  We couldn't get him to open another give for half an hour playing with those horses. They go great with the farm and plays with them all the time.  Thanks.

Thomas is setting up a new NGP&L file and would like us to save a copy of each P&L to Netco\2002\0102\region#0102.  Once you decide how you are going to break them up, one file for each book or combine them together, can you save them out there so he can start linking them.

I think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot.

Oklahoma University Athletic Director Joe Castiglione announced today that
due to recent developments, the renovations at Owen Field are well ahead of
schedule and will come in under costs. Seems over 71,000 fans shit a brick
during the fourth quarter of the bedlam football game, providing the
necessary materials to begin work right away.

Phillip,

Anna Kulic has an expense report awaiting your approval, but the situation is that you are not set up in XMS as a manager.  After discussing it with AP on Friday you have to send an email to Judy Knepshield requesting her to add you as a manager to approve expense reports for your group.  If you could please copy me on your request (email) I will make sure it gets taken care of before the end of the da

Thank You,

FYI, I will show you how to work this spreadsheet, just call this guy and tell him what you are going to name the file and why.  Tell him it is like Brian Gillis' file in Canada.  He needs to know the prefix you are going to call the file and then you attach the current date in the MMDDYYYY format.

The only FT-Central-Opt book that should move to her is the GDL.  The others should remain with Geoff Storey.  She also needs to have the INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY book.  Sorry for the mistake.

Please set up Souad Mahmassani in risktrac.  She is a new trader on the central desk.  She will be running the Aruba and central transport books.  The following books will be her responsibility:
ARUBA-SPLY-PRC
ARUBA-TP-PHY
FT-PEOPLES-BAS,PRC,IDX,GDL
FT-CENTRAL-OPT-BAS,GDL,IDX,PRC

Souad would need to roll up to the Central desk in natural gas, I would say she should be set up similar to Denver Plachy.

Please shout with any questions or additional information that you may need.  Thanks.

sounds good, I heard from Bruce that the booking is not going to well.  I don't think it is that complicated, but I will be happy to do it tomorrow.  Any luck on getting it into an existing book and not having to calc another book from here on out?  Hopefully we can do it tomorrow since it is not going live until 11/01.

Co-Steel is claiming to have triggered two deals for Nov-01 production - 1127631, 1131418.  However, these are not triggered in the system nor can I ascertain who the trader is.  Will you verify / change these deals accordingly, please.

Anne Bike has left the group and I will be taking over all her requests.  Anything related to sitara and TDS for the west desk will now be my responsibility. 
Phillip Love should now be the approver for all TDS and sitara requests related to the EAST and VNG regions.
Scott Palmer will be responsible for TDS and sitara for Wellhead, Central and Chicago regions.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?

Can you tell me if this is the last financial list we are going to get?  Jeff Gossett wants to be able to tell Don Miller if we are completely done or not.  Can I also get a master list of all financial CP's we should have moved to the bankruptcy book.  We want to run some reports to make sure IT has gotten them all out of the Price book.  Thanks.

I don't know if you can answer any of this but it seems like we're just hanging in the wind while someone ought to be able to give us answers: 

1. Do we have any vacation that we can take...if i wanted to take off this Fri for instance?

2. What's the deal with the day after Chrismas (assuming we're still around)?

We can now calc the price book and we will cross reference the list with a fwd detail of the price book to verify there are no deals with terminated counter parties.  Because of the translation to the bankruptcy book, we can not calc the bankruptcy book for a while, so we will cross reference those in the morning.  I will keep you posted.

I am starting to make my way through the Consumers balances and I have some February issues that I thought you may be able to help me with.  We have sale deal 618840 which is for Consumers contract 5040-82-42.  It looks like the deal is priced correctly, but Consumers also invoiced us for a demand fee that we don't have.  It was for 500,00 at $0.0175.  They show it as a take or pay deal.  Do you have this confirmation or can you tell me if we have this deal booked right?  I also have several other deals that look like receivables for Enron, but they've never been paid.  They are 244662, 636507, 636515 and 387756.   Should we have billed Consumers?  I don't have any Consumers the confirms for Feb, so I can't check the deals.

Attached is a file from EOL that has all the current products.  We are trying to do a mass mapping for the systems of all of these products.  As you mentioned, not all of these products will roll out initially, but we wanted to go ahead and map them in the system.  I have put in the old trader's names in a column(column F).  If you could check out the list when you get a chance and let me know if you want to change the traders on any of the products and who will be trading the products for the traders that are not moving over(names highlighted in green).  Also, there are no current products under Jason Wolfe, Matt Smith or Jane Tholt.  Please let me know if we need to create products for them or if we will be moving existing ones to them.  Please also let me know which traders need to also have a physical book.  The list I gave you this morning is the financial books we set up.  Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Phillip -

Who was the contact on your desk that was supposed to send me the Transport
Model information?  I have yet to receive it and thought that I would try
to get in touch with him.

Thanks,

The only books that should still have deals in them, other than NG-Price, will be 

Intra-Ont-Cad		all canadian gas daily deals
NGPR-Can
Oil-NG-Spec
Ft-Ont-Central		all consolidated price/basis deals

these books will still have to be calculated after today.

All counterparty deals were moved over the weekend but any remaining desk to desk deals were not touched.  We need to move those ourselves today.
All others need to be calculated and officialized one more time today then inactivated on the Rac website for tomorrow.

Dear all-

Could you all please review the attached list and see if these are any of your books (or if you know anything about them)?  If they are, could you please let me know if they should be included in the new RisktRAC hierarchy?  We ran a comparison from the active book list that I received from you all to what is currently shown as active in RisktRAC and came up with these differences.  Please let me know either way if any of these are your books so that I won't harass you anymore!  I need a response ASAP.

I appreciate your help!  Thanks,

Christy

just confirmed it with the Vet school.  They asked we "keep it quiet" because they had to sign a confidentiality agreement saying it would not be promoted.  He said as long as the wind is not too strong, she will fly in the first 45 minutes of the show.  Record it and we can watch it when I am there next Friday.

Frank/Scott,

Are either of you handling deal # 22957 (sell to TBG Cogen)? There is a price discrepancy for Nov. 2001.

TBG Cogen Partners is disputing the rate invoiced by ENA for November 2001 gas. ENA invoiced a rate of $3.4367 for deal # 22957. The customer claims the rate should be as follows: first 4,000/d @ $2.25, remainder over 4,000 @ monthly index of delivery location + $.025. Please review and advise.

Thanks,
Genaro

Saw this morning we hired Petrino.  I did not realize how successful he has been at the college level.  Three times his offenses have led the nation in offense.  He also did a good job with Quarterbacks.  He has three playing in the NFL now that he developed.  I think this might be a real good move.  How are things there?

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo

Hi Phillip,

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks

Once again, it appears we have changed a price desk deal without letting them know.  I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.  This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.  This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.  Next time this happens, someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.  To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule:
Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed, the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until Errol or Joey tells you that there book is ok.  If that happens to be midnight, sorry.  That is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions.  Sorry I have to be a jerk, but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked.  Thanks for your help in eliminating this in the future.

We have actually been able to find that bread here at Sam's, so we are absolutely set man.  If they stop selling it, we can get it over the internet, it is just a little pricier.  You need to get us to start buying it here and shipping to you man - Sam's has it for less than $4 a loaf.  I think Ashley said it is close to $6 in San Diego.  We still need to get you some soup don't we?

We went to the game.  unfortunately, I picked up a cold from being out in
the rain all night Friday and Saturday, but we had a blast.  A win cures
everything.

We are now ranked #20, we were previously unranked.  Where did you guys go
camping?  Do you rough it all the way?  My idea of camping is watching TV
outdoors.

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Subject:	RE: NICOR

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo

Hi Phillip,

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks

Yes it will.  This deal is still in the structuring stage.  We simply wanted to get the books set up in TAGG and Sitara for if and when this deal goes live.  I will keep you posted.  I think that logistics is also going to be setting up a pipe called MGU that will have all of these deals on them.  I will get with you when I hear the final so that we can map the correct curves to these locations.  Thanks.

A new Central desk has been set up "ENA - IM MGU" in Sitara.
Is this a new physical desk that will need to have it's positions rollup into the "Central Region Intramonth Position".

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.


CP ID	Short Name	Code	Region	Commodity	Uom	Currency	Commodity/UOM/Curr	P	B	Idx	GD	PHY	Y

just a status reminder of what is going on:
-Please give me a list of your goals and objectives, we will plan on meeting at least once a month and going over those to determine how I can better help you meet those and we can track progress.
-We now have a file in the central file in excel entitled project list central desk.  there are a list of projects already out there that each of you need to sign up for.  This will assist in the PRC process in terms of providing me with examples of things each of you are doing that are contributions to the organization.  If you can think of a project that will be an improvement, please add it.  If you add a project, put an expected completion date and then put the date it was completed.
-  We will meet this week or first thing next week to go over the status of each of your "training plans"

Can you run a component VaR report again for me.  We can not figure out where Souad's VaR is coming from.  IT fixed the curves and Burton fixed them on his side, the VaR should be virtually nonexistent.  I am also noticing a high VaR for Virawan Yawaponsiri, can you also run one on hers please.  Sorry to continue to bother you with this, Jeff Gossett just wants this resolved ASAP.  Thanks.

Hello Everyone!

Please let us know if your traders are planning on trading on EOL Thursday the 22nd, and Friday the 23rd.  Thanksgiving, of course, is an Enron holiday and Exchange holiday, however we know that the traders sometimes still trade on holidays!

Let us know the level of trading so we can prepare for coverage on our end.

Thanks,

I only show that we should have triggered 1127631 for December and they did not trigger 1131418 at all.  They will need to provide documentation to us - i.e. signed confirms that show this was done.  Is the trigger price they are suggesting in our favor or not?  If it is in our favor, I am sure we will change it ASAP.  Please let me know.

Phillip,

Co-Steel is claiming to have triggered two deals for Nov-01 production - 1127631, 1131418.  However, these are not triggered in the system nor can I ascertain who the trader is.  Will you verify / change these deals accordingly, please.

Thank you,

The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books. Please note that there are still several deals that I am trying to reconcile back to Sitara numbers. Assuming that I can do so, I will send supplemental information tomorrow afternoon.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Thank you,

looks like Florida will not be very good next year.  They are losing their best players to the draft.  All three of their receivers and their best cornerback and offensive linemen have now declared for the draft today.  Add to that they can not get a coach to sign on.  Shanahan just turned it down, they are now going to New Orleans offensive coordinator.  See what happens.  Did you get your pool cover fixed?

I've been following the story in the paper since last week.  If you look
real close at the story though, you'll see that all these national
offensive leads were for small schools (NAIA, Division 1AA, etc.).  But,
still good news.  I forget the name of the Jaquars quarterback, but he
has nothing but praise for Petrino.

Now, if we can just get a defensive coordinator.  Wouldn't hurt to have
some defensive players too.

Things are okay here.  Kind of cold.  Ready for spring.

Saw this morning we hired Petrino.  I did not realize how successful he
has been at the college level.  Three times his offenses have led the
nation in offense.  He also did a good job with Quarterbacks.  He has
three playing in the NFL now that he developed.  I think this might be a
real good move.  How are things there?

Phillip	

I'm trying to determine if this liquidation for MichCon VQ7167.2 is related to synthetic storage.  The Sitara ticket referenced on the tagg is 941953 is an exchange ticket, but it was killed on August 3.  Can you help?

Thanks
Cathy
