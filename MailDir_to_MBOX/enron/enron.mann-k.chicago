Attached is the latest draft of the MEH Risk Management Policy.  Mary 
Nordstrom, Kay Classen and I have went through it line by line, and we are 
now at the point where we need one last (hopefully) review.  My goal is to 
have both the Risk Management Policy and the Risk Procedures and Control 
Guidelines in a form that we would execute by the end of day next Wednesday, 
the 9th.  Judy is coming into the office on Thursday and I want to give them 
both to her for her review at that time.  Therefore, I would like to have 
your comments by the end of day Monday in order to have time to communicate 
with Mary and Kay and prepare a clean product for Judy.  Let me know if there 
is any problem with the schedule I have outlined.

As always - thanks for your assistance,

Gregg

Subject: MEH Policies

Welcome back.  I am sure you have been looking forward to getting all these 
documents, so here they are.  Attached are the following:

1)

Current draft of the MEH Risk Policy.  Kay, Mary and I have discussed the 
current draft line by line and are at the point where your review is needed 
to proceed.  Vlady has reviewed the current draft and has no significant 
changes.  

2)

Current draft of the Risk Procedures and Control Guidelines and accompanying 
flowcharts.  Brent Price and his team have reviewed the Procedures and have 
provided revisions where appropriate.  Linda and Mary have also provided 
input which has been incorporated.  I need to circulate the draft to all 
parties one more time to make sure everyone is comfortable with the last 
updates and that there are no inconsistencies.

3)

Current draft of the credit policy as last revised by Aparna.  The draft was 
sent last night to Molly Harris at Enron for her review and I am currently 
waiting to hear from her.  If there are any changes to this draft I will 
notify you promptly and forward the newest draft.

4)
Current draft of the proposed cash management policy.  Jim Burns has reviewed 
the proposed cash management policy and is in general agreement with the 
procedures.  We will be drafting a Facility Agreement shortly which will 
cover the specifics of the Enron Revolver to MEH.

As for reports and a general understanding of limit development, modeling, 
stress testing, etc., there have been several meetings over the last week.  
Brent Price and his team were in Chicago last week to go over the daily 
reports with Linda, Tim, Maria, Kay and Mary and discuss the development of 
the Daily Position Report (DPR). To my knowledge, the only outstanding report 
is the DPR.  The DPR you received on Tuesday was not an MEH only DPR and was 
not scrubbed before it was sent out.  It was intended to show the format, but 
they inadvertently pulled numbers into it.  I am expecting that a scrubbed 
DPR will be sent out end of this week (Since the EMW and MEH books are 
currently "flat", the DPR will not show any open positions or VAR - we can 
discuss in more detail if you want).  Regarding risk management 
methodologies, Mary has had discussions with Vlady and our research staff and 
I have received positive feedback regarding the sharing of information.  

I realize this is a large amount of information to digest, but I would like 
to get together as soon as you have a chance to review the policies and talk 
to Mary, Kay, Linda, etc. in order to come up with a list of any remaining 
issues.  I acknowledge that this should and will be a evolutionary process, 
but I also want to have a clear direction of what is necessary to approve the 
policies.   Just let me know when you are available and I will make myself 
available.

Thanks,

Gregg

Kay -FYI, this note was prepared by Peoples on what they believe to be the 
open commercial issues.  I will probably sit down with them on Friday to get 
their true viewpoint on the various items.  They tend to be much more open 
with me outside the large group.  If only I could work this into a happy hour 
we would be set.


Also, Please don't acknowledge in front of Peoples that you have received 
this, although I believe this was prepared with input from their counsel.

Thanks,

Gregg

Here is a quick, rough draft at a DASH for the MEH revolver.  You had 
indicated that a high level summary should suffice, so that is where I have 
started.  Please indicate where additional information should be included.  I 
didn't want to get too bogged down in the details unless necessary.  I have 
also included the draft cash management policy that I referred to in the 
DASH.  

Any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Gregg

I believe that we are in a position to cross one more agreement off our 
list.  I had a conference call on Friday afternoon with Boyd Springer, Roy 
Rodriguez (Peoples Commercial), Tim Hermann (Peoples Commercial), Mary 
Klyasheff (Peoples Regulatory Counsel) and Gerry Fox (Peoples Regulatory 
Counsel) to discuss Boyd's comments regarding the regulatory issues of the 
Affiliate Master.  His comments and our recommendations are as follows:

1)  Boyd had initially questioned the need to file for approval due to an 
exemption that exists for transactions conducted with Affiliates in the 
ordinary course of business at standard or prevailing market prices.  

There are two types of Affiliate transactions contemplated; a) simple 
buy/sells at a clear market price (which will fall under the exemption and 
don't need to wait for ICC approval ) and b) complex transactions with 
sharing arrangements,  management fees or other similar structures (which 
will not fall under the exemption and must wait for ICC approval).  Since ICC 
approval must be sought for certain transactions, it is recommended that we 
proceed with filing the Affiliate Master ASAP.

2)  Boyd had noted that as written the Affiliate Master becomes effective 
upon initial approval of the ICC.  However, there is an appeal/rehearing 
process for intervenors after initial approval and prior to final approval.  
Therefore, there exists a remote possibility that we could begin transacting 
under the Affiliate Master and not receive final approval.

After discussing this issue with Mary and Gerry, the probability is minimal 
that such an event would occur as we will receive feedback from the ICC from 
both the informal conversations prior to filing and throughout the process 
prior to approval.  As such, it is recommended that the effective date as 
written is acceptable.

3)  Boyd had indicated that the inclusion of the confidentiality provision 
may add further complexity to the filing and may want to be avoided to ease 
approval.  

After discussing the issue further, it appears that the confidentiality 
provision does add some complexity in the filing process in that additional 
steps must be taken.  However, after the filing is made, the inclusion does 
not add to the approval time in any measurable way.  Further, Peoples always 
files its contracts under confidentiality and feels that this should be no 
different.  Given that it will protect transactional information and does not 
add any time to the approval process, it is  recommended that we include the 
confidentiality provision as written.  

In summary, unless there are any other concerns, we should proceed with 
filing the Affiliate Master as currently written.  Jeff Hodge has already 
reviewed, approved and initialed the Affiliate Master as to its transactional 
content.   

Prior to filing, Kathy Donofrio (V.P., Regulatory Affairs) will forward of 
copy of the Affiliate Master to the ICC Staff followed shortly by a meeting 
to discuss the impending filing and get any initial feedback that may affect 
the filing.  

Current expectations are that approval will take a minimum of four months.  
For comparisons, Nicor currently has an Affiliate filing at the ICC that 
began in May and is already postponed until October.  Further, the current 
high priced gas environment has caught the attention of the ICC.  Although it 
may mean the ICC will be very busy, it may also be an opportunity to get an 
expedited approval if we can show the ICC that PGL/NS ratepayers will benefit 
from the Affiliate Master.

Boyd - Please let us know if I have mistated any of the issues or if you 
disagree with any of the recommendations as I would like to give Peoples the 
green light today to proceed with the filing process.

Thanks,

GREGG

Jeff,
MEH is requesting to be a Customer of PGL's Hub, to do so we need to execute 
a PALS agreement (see attached).  I believe this is the same document ENA and 
EMW have already executed.

Upon approval,  please review and fax a signed  "authorized" copy to Laura 
Luce for signature.  Our fax number is 312-541-2728.  Legal questions 
regarding the document should be forwarded to PECORP's Simon Halfin 
(312-240-4411).

Thanks You

As you can see, the DASH has some bracketted portion that needs

At Sheila's suggestion, we have decided to bite off the overall PERC 
tranaction in little pieces, attacking the most critical one's individually 
as we go.  

In order for us to focus on the value/commercial issues surrounding the sites 
in Com-Ed, we need to get the ball in motion on the site sale release from 
PERC first.  

This should be a brief - but binding - letter agreement which includes the 
following points:

PERC is hereby authorizing ENA to solicit interests in the Calumet and 
Torrence sites for the purpose of sale, joint venture, development, or other 
transactions.
ENA will have the sole and exclusive authority to determine whether or not to 
commit the site(s) to such a commercial transaction, and PERC shall have the 
right - but not the obligation - to participate in said transaction on an 
equal ownership basis with ENA. 
In the event that PERC does not elect to participate in said transaction, ENA 
shall have the right to undertake such a transaction to the exclusion of 
PERC, provided that ENA pays PERC the following exercise prices for the 
site(s) in question:  Calumet price = $1,000,000.  Torrence price = 
$100,000.  
Said exercise price shall be the sole and total compensation for PERC should 
they elect not to participate in said transaction as proposed by ENA.
PERC shall have __ days to give formal written notice of its intent to 
participate in such transaction from the date of notice by ENA.
If PERC elects to participate with ENA on said transaction(s), ENA and PERC 
will share equally in any proceeds thereof, however, no exercise price shall 
be payable if PERC elects to participate with ENA.
The term of this authorization shall be for 90 days from the date of 
execution and 10 days evergreen thereafter unless cancelled by either party 
by two days written notice.
This agreement is binding on the parties hereto, provided however, that it 
shall be conditioned upon PERC and Enron (or an affiliate or agent thereof) 
executing a mutually agreeable document to effect the transfer of ownership 
of their turbines for a purchase price of $56,000,000.


The next item we will need is a authorization document allowing us (Enron 
Canada/ENA) to negotiate with ABB for changes needed in the ABB contract.

David: Here are comments on the draft you sent yesterday. Good job as
always. (1) Page 1-should have new date; (2) Sect. 1.17-change spelling of
"interruptible" before parking and loaning; (3) Sect. 2.2-Note the sentence
toward the bottom of p. 4 indicating that neither MEH nor Peoples is liable
... in performing its duties, absent willful misconduct or gross
negligence." Does this (or something similar) sufficiently protect MEH from
liability so as to permit adjustment of 2.9 (ii) to delete the commercial
reasonableness qualification for MEH's responsibilities? From a regulatory
perspective, I would like to avoid qualifying the obligation to follow the
GTC, if we can address the liability concern in another way. (4) Sect.
2.10. There should be something before "(ii)", maybe "and";  Sect. 2.4.
There is a sentence missing between before the new sentence which Peoples
was in Peoples' draft and is important to include: "Peoples may only revise
information regarding firm Hub Capacity that is provided to MEH pursuant to
Section 2.4(a) if MEH consents to such revision." This should be the second
sentence of the text following the listed items (before the strikoeover
which starts "Peoples shall inform...").

Karen,

As far as I'm concerned you have answered my legal questions.  I will add 
that I think that it is the City which  has preserved its option as to who 
repairs the road since they have approval authority.  However, this doesn't 
seem like a big issue to me.

So long as the commercial team is happy with the minor changes with the risk 
profile, I'm happy.

Kay

Subject: Schaffer Land Option - Pontiac Site

I wanted to send out a reminder to everyone that I had indicated to Mr. 
Schaeffer that we would be sending him a document last week and to suggest 
that we try to get something out to him this week if at all possible.  

Since our critical final zoning vote is next Thursday, I want to make sure we 
don't give him any reason to get "up in arms" over this issue and start 
thinking we have just been leading him along without intending to follow 
through on the deal.  Mark and Karen have done such an exemplary job on the 
zoning (record time) that I don't want anything to get in our way at the 
final moment.  Mr. Schaeffer is one of the wealthier and more influential 
farmers in the area, and has thus far been pretty quiet at the meetings, 
however, he pointedly cornered me at the end of our last meeting to ask about 
this issue.  Lets keep him happy.

Please let me know if we can get it out this week, so I can call him and 
apologize for the delay and give him a new improved delivery date of the 
draft documents.


Thanks.

Hi guys,

Here are some quick thoughts:

2.10  Suggest we delete "specific" from second line.  
3.3  (i)To protect cash flow neutral status we need to get the money a couple 
of business days before date due.
6.2  We need to discuss changes which could materially impact the value of 
the agreement to MEH, not just the risks/responsibilities.

I'd bracket the concept of what the Admin Service Fee is supposed to cover.  
Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing 
docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?  I think we probably need to 
limit our role to "short of litigation" type stuff.   Maybe "reasonable 
efforts, short of litigation", something like that?

That's all for the first quick read.  

Kay

Subject: Agency Agreement


As we discussed, in an effort to forward our internal discussions and 
memorialize the results of our discussions in Chicago last week, Boyd and I 
have produced a new draft of the Agency Agreement.  The changes can be 
inspected by launching the attachment in Word and then going to Tools --- 
Track Changes --- Highlight Changes to display and print the changes in the 
document.

A number of questions must be addressed.  They include, in no particular 
order:

Can we delete the confidentiality article?

Is it commercially important to restore the langauge on displacement 
deliveries?

What will the compensation arrangements be?

Are we willing to deduct the administrative fee from the net cumulative 
revenues?  [Doing so "loses" us $10,000 a month.]

Will we collect accounts receivable directly or have payments made to a 
deposit account in which we will retain a security interest?

How should Section 2.9(ii) be recast to allay Boyd's regulatory approval 
concern?

Is the new Section 2.10 acceptable?

How must the agreement change to reflect the "two county" concern?

I look forward to discussing this with you at your convenience.  DT

Here are my comments:

Revise  "whereas" clauses to make it an option for an easement, not a current 
grant of an easement.

Should we be able to enter all of Parcel 2 for due diligence, as opposed to 
just the easement area?  (paragraph 7)

Matt, I wanted you to be aware of paragraph 17.

Recommendations:

As the General Manager of the PERC/Enron Joint Power Development Program, 
Enron hereby submits its recommendations to the Management Committee for 
their consideration regarding the pending Torrence south parcel land 
acquisition decision.

After reviewing the relevant commercial, legal and environmental issues with 
the respective Project Managers and development personnel, Enron recommends 
that the following courses of action be undertaken:

1.  PERC should notify Peoples Gas, Light & Coke (PGL) on 6/16/00 that PERC 
does not intend to assume the role of Buyer as provided for in the terms of 
the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 
4/11/2000. 

2.  Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land 
purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000 and PGL 
proceeds to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing, PERC and Enron should continue 
their due diligence and development activities on the Torrence south parcel.  
Upon establishment of a proposed budget and schedule, these activities should 
be focused on achieving the goals of minimizing out-of-pocket development 
expenses and implementing prudent risk mitigation strategies on behalf of 
PERC and Enron.

3.  Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land 
purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000 and PGL 
plans to proceed to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing, PERC and PGL should 
immediately begin preparation of the documents necessary to achieve the ICC 
approval of any future transfer (sale,lease, or alternative structure) of the 
Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC.


Other Issues/Risks:

1.  This recommendation is based upon the belief that although the Torrence 
south parcel does hold potential value to PERC and Enron as a project 
development site, the overall viability and risk/reward profile of the 
commercial opportunity has not yet been sufficiently finalized.  

The potential sources of value associated with this site are listed below:

 a. The site/project currently hold a priority position in the ComEd 
interconnection queue.
 b. The site (in combination with the Calumet project) captures the majority 
of available interconnection capability (500-600 MW) in the Calumet region of 
the ComEd system.  This would force competing IPP projects (i.e. Wizvest) to 
bear the financial burden of ComEd system upgrade costs.
 c. The site (in combination with the Calumet project) represents an integral 
component of developing a commercial solution to the Mission Energy/ComEd 500 
MW "in-city" regulatory obligation to the city of the Chicago.
 d. The site represents one of the unique in-city sites capable of supporting 
a power project from a zoning, fuel supply, and transmission perspective.

The factors contributing to the recommendation for PERC and Enron not to 
proceed to closing on 6/26/00 are listed below:

 a. The existence of known environmental contamination and the liabilities 
associated with entering the chain of title on the Torrence south parcel.
 b. The indemnification language contained within the land purchase Agreement 
executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000.
 c. The incomplete status of the overall commercial development opportunity 
associated with the Torrence south parcel.
 d. PERC and Enron's desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize 
development costs while further developing the commercial development 
opportunity and associated value proposition prior to executing an 
ICC-approved land transfer from PGL to Torrence Power LLC.


2.  It is PERC and Enron's understanding that PGL plans to proceed to the 
closing on 6/26/00 and assume the role of Buyer under the terms of the land 
purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000.  

3.  The south parcel represents a potential power plant development project 
site upon which PERC and Enron will continue to conduct due diligence and 
development activities.  The site is currently being evaluated as a candidate 
for a 6 x LM 6000 facility with either an '01 or '02 in-service date.

4.  PERC and Enron have decided that it would not be prudent for either of 
their respective organizations to assume any form of environmental liability 
associated with the Torrence south parcel. PERC and Enron shall work to 
develop risk mitigation strategies including land options, environmental 
indemnifications, and other structures which protect their respective assets 
and the overall economic viability of a development project on the Torrence 
south parcel.

5.  A potential risk associated with the above recommendations is that the 
time required to complete the ICC approval process necessary to transfer the 
Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC.  PERC development 
personnel have estimated that the ICC approval process could require up to 6 
months (The transfer of the Calumet parcel was "fast-tracked" and took 3 
months to achieve ICC approval).  This risk could impact the viability of an 
'01 in-service date for a Torrence Power LLC development project.  PERC and 
Enron will work to minimize the impact of this risk.

6.  PERC and Enron shall work to develop a binding agreement which specifies 
an approval and cost-sharing mechanism for future development decisions on 
the Torrence south parcel.  Such an agreement shall also specify a formula 
for the sharing of proceeds associated with the marketing/selldown strategy 
currently under development by PERC and Enron for all of the Chicago 
development projects.


Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss the 
above recommendations and information.

_______________________________________________________________

Here are my comments on the draft received earlier today: (1) Sect. 1.9.
The second to last sentence in the definition of Cumulative Net Revenues
duplicates part (but not all) of the first sentence of Section 7.2 with
regard to what is included in Cumulative Net Revenue. (I don't believe the
language of Sect. 7.2 regarding the make-up of Cumulative Net Revenue is
intended to be only "for purposes of Section 7.1" as the wording of 7.2
suggests, so this could be confusing.) Perhaps the make-up of Cumulative
Net Revenue should be covered in just one place or, as an alternative, the
definition 1.9 could cross-reference 7.2. Also, the last sentence of 1.9 is
confusing. I believe this means the same thing as is stated expressly in
the last sentence of Sect. 7.2, i.e., "Cumulative Net Revenues includes
uncollectable accounts receivable for which Peoples has assumed credit risk
pursuant to Section 2.10." As I understand it, the second part of the
sentence means: "Cumumlative Net Revenues shall not be adjusted to reflect
revenues refunded in accordance with Section 3.3, unless the refund is
attributable to (see my comment below re use of the word "knowing")
application by MEH, without the knowledge or consent of Peoples, of a rate
which exceeds the maximum rate allowed under Peoples' applicable FERC
Tariffs." Perhaps we could state this more clearly in 1.9 or
cross-reference 7.2. (2) Sect. 3.3. I would delete part (i) if the last
sentence. It would be illegal and contrary to this Agreement for MEH (or
Peoples) to charge a rate above the maximum, so it seems inappropriate to
suggest that MEH can collect a fee for doing this. Also in this Section,
Part (ii) of the third sentence was modified to add the word "knowingly" to
describe the situation where MEH would be responsible to pay a refund.
Because this is not something MEH can legally do, it seems inappropriate to
have a provision addressing it. The Agreement can properly address the
responsibility for refund of an inadvertent overcharge, which is how I
interpreted this provision of 3.3 in the last draft. Perhaps we should just
make Peoples responsible for all refunds. Let me know what you think. (3)
Sect. 7.2. As indicated above, I am not sure that these provisions re
Cumulative Net Revenue are only "for purposes of Section 7.1". I would
suggest a clarification of how this works as indictaed in point 1 above.
Also, 6 lines from the end of 7.2, I think the reference to 7.2 (ii) is a
typo. I believe it's just 7.2.(4) Sect. 18.3. Do we want to include any
work related to the Governmental Approval as "ordinary course"? If so,
there is some suggested language in an e-mail I sent dated Aug. 28. It
suggests a revision to item (vi).

Sheila,

Attached is the edited Master Purchase and Sale document (AKA the "affiliate 
document") between PGL/MEH.  Please review and provide comments back PGL's 
attorney (Simon Halfin, (email: S.Halfin@pecorp.com, phone # 312-240-4411).   
Per Gregg Penman's reccomendation, please coordinate with Kay Mann on who 
from Enron is representing MEH on this document.  Gregg and I will be the 
commercial point contact for MEH and Dave Wear for PGL/NSG.

Again, once executed  PGL/NSG representative will petition the ICC for the 
right to buy and/or sell gas to an affiliate under this master contract.  A 
final decision/recommendation needs to be made if this document will be filed 
before or with the Hub Agency document.

Roy:

Attached for MEH's review is a draft Master Natural Gas Contract between
Peoples Gas and MEH.  This draft contract is based on the Master Natural Gas
Contract between Peoples Gas and EMW which was executed on June 30, 2000.
For your convenience, I have attached a compare of the two contracts.  As
you will note, apart from the addition of an ICC approval requirement, most
of the changes are of an editorial nature. Please note that this draft is
still subject to management approval.

Let me know if the form of this document is acceptable to MEH.  If you have
any questions, please call me.

Simon Halfin

Gentlemen,

I thought I would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on 
certain tasks.  Here goes:

Hub Agency Agreement - Gregg recently met with Peoples to discuss some of the 
outstanding commercial issues relating to the Hub Agency Agreement.  Roy is 
putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting.  Gregg and I 
decided it would be better to not send Peoples the current draft of the 
agreement which has been circulated internally, but instead will send a draft 
which incorporates the outcome of these discussions.

Memo regarding restricted activities - David has prepared a draft for Enron's 
review.  Here's the draft:

Gregg and I need to review it.

Gregg and Peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list.  
Since both sides are running behind on this,  David prepared a very straight 
forward amenment to the LLC agreement, exending the time frame for finishing 
the task.  Here it is:
 

Policies - Gregg "Policy Man" Penman has been working on a credit policy, 
cash management policy, risk management policy, and probably a couple of 
others I'm forgetting.

Revolving line of credit - Gregg has been working the internal Enron system 
to get approval for a $50mm line of credit for MEH.  He has raised the issue 
of Peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half.  Also, it may be 
necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid 
before any distributions are made to either member.  This is still under 
internal review at Enron.  I will check around to see if Corp (the lender) 
has a form of credit facility we should use.

Miscellaneous:
Decide about services agreement
Confidentiality agreements 
Transfer pricing documentation
Other agreements (ISDA, GISB, Peaking Agency, Third Party Master)
Board resolution appointing officers/managers
Budget and marketing plan 
Other administrative functions (per Gregg's Business Setup Items list)

Hope this is helpful.

Kay

Per my voice mail, will you please take a quick look at my edits to Vlady's 
draft risk management policy attached below.  I don't think any of them are 
problematic, but Vlady has some concerns mainly because the base Enron Corp. 
risk management policy was used as the template and therefore I am 
effectively making edits to it.

I will be leaving the office today around 11:00 so I want to turn this to 
Peoples before then if possible.  On any other business, I will be 
unavailable from 1:30 to probably 3:00 today, but can be reached via pager 
800-980-1771 or cell phone 312-925-8888 at any other time.

As always - thanks for your help.

Section II: I don't like the title "Commercial Development Manager" but 
rather "Risk Manager" 
Response:         The title Commercial Development Manager comes from the MEH 
Operating Agreement.  We can amend the LLC Agreement  if necessary, but it 
seems burdensome since the title is only a formality.  However, as currently 
written, the Commercial Development Manager is the person responsible for 
managing the daily business, i.e. similar to a desk director.  In order to 
maintain control of this position, it can only be filled by an Enron nominee 
and will report directly to the MEH General Manager, Laura Luce of Enron.

Section VII: Majority of the wording came initially from attorneys, I would 
recommend confirming that.
Response:          I will run this by the attorneys.  However, from a 
technical perspective, Section VII refers to employees of MEH.  No one in the 
Chicago office is an employee of MEH, but rather we all remained employees of 
our respective organizations.  I will ask the attorneys if we need to limit 
all Chicago based employees, both of Enron North America and Peoples Energy 
Resources.

Section VIII: Who is the General Manager of MEH?
Response:          As mentioned above, Laura Luce, Vice President of Enron 
North America
  Is Enron North America Corp. a legal entity?
Response:          Yes, Enron North America Corp. replaced Enron Capital 
Trade and Resources as the Wholesale business of Enron Corp.  Unless you know 
something different, I believe that to be a true statement.

Let me know if any of my responses don't make sense or you still have any 
questions.  I am still going to try to get this out by 10:00 or so.

Vlady - As we discussed, I am attaching my revisions to your initial draft.  
They are mainly cosmetic attempts to make the RM Policy terms consistent with 
the MEH Operating Agreement and separate MEH from any behind the scenes 
reporting or controls that ENA chooses to place on Richard/MEH.  Let me know 
if you have any concerns about my edits.  I would like to send this to 
Peoples end of day today.  I will follow up with Structuring to find a body 
to model the underlying asset position.  

Thanks - Gregg

Comments:

1.  The Schedule refers to these listed contracts "as each may be amended, 
revised or modified from time to time."  In our negotiations, we had talked 
about whether we would be able to modify these without the other party's 
consent and (I believe) decided that we shouldn't be allowed.  Since this is 
a "kings under bridges" point ["The Law, in its majestic equality, forbids 
the rich, as well as the poor, to sleep under the bridges, to beg in the 
streets, and to steal bread." -- Anatole France], I defer to your commercial 
judgment as to whether Enron would be better served with or without a mutual 
right of review for amendments, extensions, etc.

2.  As for the disclaimer language, I propose:

The inclusion of any contract listed below on this schedule is not, nor shall 
it be deemed to be, an admission that the execution or performance of that 
contract would constitute an EMW Restricted Activity.

3.  I'd change,

"Agreements, . . . that Enron MW, LLC and EMW Restricted Affiliates may, 
pursuant to Section 6.7.2(d) of the Agreement, perform without violating 
Section 6.7.2 of the Agreement,"

to

"Agreements, . . . that Enron MW, LLC and EMW Restricted Affiliates may, 
pursuant to section (c) of the definition of EMW Permitted Activities in the 
Agreement, perform without violating Section 6.7.2 of the Agreement."

4.  Peoples' list of contracts is extensive and somewhat cryptic.  I never 
understood that we were automatically agreeing that the arrangements they had 
in place (whatever they may be) would be deemed approved, without question or 
effect on our transaction.  It seems to me that commercial due diligence is 
required to ascertain whether grandfathering these arrangements -- without 
any participation or profit-sharing by the Hub -- is appropriate. We ought 
also to have some mechanism to ensure that the scope of these arrangements is 
not expanded.  Do you agree?

I look forward to discussing this with you.  DT

Hello - attached are copies of Schedule A (Enron MW) and Schedule B
(Peoples MW) to the MEH LLC Agreement.  Peoples has included a few projects
they are working on that don't have existing agreements.  Enron's list is
much shorter, 3 agreements to be exact.  The third agreement is a storage
deal with Nicor that would technically be a permitted activity under the
trading exclusion.  However, I believe we decided to include it, but we
need to also include the disclaimer language that inclusion on the Schedule
does not imply a restricted activity.  I have asked Hunter Shively, Central
Desk Director, if he knows of any other "middle-market" deals that we
should include and he said no.  I have also had our back office run the
counterparties through our trading systems to identify any term
transactions that may currently be in place.  Other than the Nicor deal
listed, there were only standard trading buy/sells with Nicor in the
system.  Which brings up my last point, do we need to disclose the
existence of Master Purchase Agreements with a Covered Gas Utility?
Trading uses these Agreements for standard physical buy/sells.  Anything
more complicated would be done under a separate agreement.  The Nicor deal
was done under a separate agreement, not the existing Master.  If my vote
counts, I say let's not include them.  But, I defer to the experts.

Let me know your thoughts on the attached,

Thanks,

Gregg

_______________________________________________________________

The following discusses the regulatory issues raised at our June 14 meeting
with Peoples.                                           1. Expanded
termination right for unacceptable "Regulatory Approval".  As discussed
prior to the meeting, language of Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2 and 15.1(f) was
changed to provide a termination right in the event that an unacceptable
regulatory order is issued after initial approval of the Agency Agreement,
but during its term. Peoples explained at the meeting their view that a
termination right should exist in the event of an adverse rate order (e.g.,
Illinois Commission order imputing what Peoples believes to be an
unreasonably high level of Hub revenue and, therefore, unaccpetably
lowering retail gas rates) or FERC determination that, based on Hub
operations, Peoples is in jeopardy of losing its status as a Hinshaw
pipeline. These were examples of the types of orders Peoples has in mind.
As proposed in our draft, either party would have a termination right in
the event that the Agency Agreement is not initially approved by the ICC on
acceptable terms. Under our approach, however, the parties would have to
live with ;later adverse regulatory orders unless an order had the effect
of revoking the Hub's operating authority. My view is that we could
reasonably agree to a termination right (similar to Sect. 11.1 (vi) and
(vii) of the LLC Agreement) which grants a termination right, "in the event
that a Jugment determines that, as a result of Hub Transactions, Peoples is
subject to comprehensive rate regulation as a natural gas company or public
utility by the FERC; or loses its status as an exempt Hinshaw pipeline
under Section 1(c) of the Natural Gas Act." I would suggest that we
otherwise stay with our original language re regulatory approvals. Once
Peoples obtains an order from the ICC which both parties accept, Peoples
should be willing to assume the risk (which,in my opinion is minimal) that
an adverse rate decision would cause it to wish to terminate the Agency
Agreement. (David suggested at the meeting that, as another option, we
could agree to a termination right due to an adverse regulatory order if
Peoples chooses to discontinue all Hub Transactions, but I am not sure that
we need to offer this at this stage.) The word "required" should be
restored to Definitions 1.1 and 1.11.              2. Extended Hub
Services. Peoples agreed at the meeting that there should be compensation
after termination of the Agreement for an extended Hub Service presented
during the Agreement's term. To make this clear,the words "during the term
of this Agreement" should be deleted from Sect. 7.1(ii). The deleted
wording of 7.2 should be restored, and to that Section we could add a
sentence: "The right to compensation established under Section 7.2 (ii) for
an Extended Hub Service shall survive the termination of this Agreement."
Also, in Section 15.4, I believe the reference to Sect. 3.3 should be to
7.2.                     3. "Hub Services"-Sect. 1.17. Based on discussion
at the meeting, I understand that there is a need to address the "two
county rule" in the Agreement.  In connection with this, there was
discussion of the need to change the description of the Hub Services to
make clear that the services are incidental to the primary uses of the Hub
Facilities. As I understand it, the description of the services both for
the Agreement and the GTC may be changed to replace the existing references
to transportation services a reference to "wheeling" serivces. This should
be addressed when the revised terms of the GTC are available. I believe the
business people also are discussing a procedure for approval of
transactions to ensure compliance with the two county rule, and are
preparing a list of types of transactions which will be pre=approved.
4.
Adjustment of Administrative fee for refunds. Our position, as discussed at
the meeting, is that Sect. 7.3 which provides for retroactive adjustment of
the administrative fee in the event of a refund should be deleted. In
support, we point out that MEH relies on a specific fee value in seeking
out transactions and the fee shouldn't change after-the-fact as the result
of a refund. Peoples argues that a revenue-based fee should be adjusted if
there is a change in the realized level of revenue. This was left as an
open point. Peoples acknowledged at the meeting that the proposed fee
adjustment would occur only due to a rate refund. This means that the
administrative fee could be adjusted retroactively only if a transaction
occurs under a newly proposed rate which is part of the Operating
Statement, but subject to refund at a level higher than the previously
approved rate but lower than the maximum price under the new rate. The only
portion of the fee which is at risk is the portion produced by use of a
rate above the previously approved level. If, for example, a 10% increase
is proposed and made effective subject to refund. A risk arises only if the
negotiated price is at 90% of the maximum or above. If it is, the refund
risk to MEH is its percentage of the revenue produced by the rate above the
90%above. If the rate is 95% of the maximum, the amount at risk is 5% of
MEH's 20% portion of the revenue, or 1% of the fee. A refund at this level
would occur in the example only if FERC approves no rate increase and
requires a refund of all subject to refund revenue. If FERC approves all or
part of the increase, the refund risk is reduced. Therefore, the decision
should not greatly effect the economics of the deal. If we decide to allow
some adjustment of the fee for refunds, the language should make clear that
we are including only "refunds related to a finding by FERC that a rate in
effect subject to refund is excessive and should be reduced."

5. Also with respect to refunds (required for any cause), Peoples agreed at
the meeting to provide the necessary funds. We could adjust the language of
Sect. 3.3 to read: "Peoples will pay to MEH all funds necessary to effect
such refunds on or before the earlier of : (i) the date prescribed by a Law
or Judgment for payment of such refunds; or (ii) ten (10) business days
after receiving written notice of the need for such payment." (Note:
Because refunds are required by FERC Order, Peoples would always know when
the refund has to be paid.)
6. Admin. Fee. After the business discussion of intended coverage
of the monthly fixed fee, we should reconsider the deleted language in 18.3
regarding reimbursement of costs incurred by MEH on Peoples' behalf.
7. Nomination and
Scheduling on Pipelines. Sect. 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the language
we added which requires Peoples to make any necessary nominating or
scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt and delivery of gas
at its city gate for its own account in order to effectuate Hub
transactions. The language went on to also require Peoples to arrange for
delivery of gas at a secondary delivery point by Displacement Delivery. At
the meeting, Peoples took the position that it is already required to
handle nominations and scheduling on pipelines by terms of the GTC. Peoples
also indicated that, due to the nature of the Hub Facilities and
transactions, the Delivery Points must be on Peoples' system and that
Displacement Delivery to a point which Peoples can access under one of its
pipeline agreements is not feasible for a Hub Serivce. (Note: In the
Northern Illinois Gas Hub Agreement, the utility agreed to the provision we
proposed.) With regard to the second part of our proposed sentence re
delivery by displacement at a secondary point off-system, I agree that the
GTC seems to contemplate delivery on Peoples system for the various types
of transactions covered. Perhaps we can delete section "(b)" of our
proposed sentence. I would like to know whether the business people have
comments on this. With regard to the part (a) (the requirement that Peoples
make nominanting and scheduling changes needed to effectuate Hub
transactions), however, I do not find any language in the GTC which makes
clear that this is Peoples' responsibility. Also, at our preliminary
meeting, Laura indicated that this was an important provision to restore.
(I believe Laura mentioned only part a, but need to check this.)
Therefore, I believe we should propose, at least, to restore the sentence
through part a, subject to verification with Laura and Gregg.
8. Grounds to Refuse Trransaction. Also, in 2.5, Peoples
included as one of the grounds to refuse a Hub Service presented by MEH, a
conclusion by Peoples that "Hub Capacity is deemed unavailable by Peoples
due to the service requirements of Peoples' utility customers." We pointed
out at the meeting that the GTC (Sect. 8) specifies all circumstances when
a Hub Serivce can be refused and that this provision is not one of the
specified situations. Once a firm transaction is established under the GTC,
it has equal scheduling priority with other firm interstate and intrastate
firm transactions. Peopels agreed that this item (Item 3) can be deleted. I
believe Peoples wishes to revise (1) to read: " permitted by the terms of
the GT&C, or required by any Law and Judment:.               9. Sect. 3.5.
Peoples proposes to delete our proposed Section 3.5 which requires Peoples
to use its best efforts to minimize imbalances experienced by Hub Shippers
through use of management services offered under pipeline tariffs. Such
services should be offered soon under Order 637 compliance filings. This
provision was inserted as part of a paragraph in Peoples' initial draft
which would have required MEH to compensate Peoples for imbalances
experienced on pieplines as a result of Hub Transactions. Peoples had taken
this provision from the NIGAS Hub agreement. In response, we had included
the wording of 3.5 to, at least, require best efforts to minimize
imbalances on the pipelines. Peoples now proposes to delete all of this on
the ground that imbalances on the pipelines are the responsibility of the
Hub Shippers, and not of Peoples or MEH. The GTC has provisions covering
the responsibility of shippers to address imbalances on the Hub Facilities,
and Peoples points to the Parking and Loaning  Service for Shippers to
address imbalances. In reviewin g this, I believe Peoples is right. Because
the language requiring MEH to address imbalnaces on the pieplines has been
deleted, I think we can delete the language of 3.5 requiring Peoples to use
best efforts to minimize those imbalances.
10. Sect. 2.2 Responsibility
for regulatory compliance. Peoples proposed changes to the language we
inserted in 2.2 in the second sentence from the end which indicated that
Peoples is responsible for compliance with the GTC. Peoples proposed that
each party be responsible. At the meeting, we explained that this language
was included to recognize FERC precedent requiring that, in circumstances
such as this, the agreement must identify the party responsible for
regulatory complaince and that party must be the certificate holder.
Peoples agreed at the meeting that our original language for this sentence
should be restored.      11. The Agreement (6.1) presently provides that
Peoples, in its sole discretion, may propose changes in the GTC. David
indicated at the meeting that, at a minimum, MEH should be advised of
changes in advance and provided with an opportunity for comments before
such changes are proposed. Peoples agreed to include such a provision.
Also, Peoples agreed that Section 5.1 should include a representation that
Peoples has provided MEH with a current copy of the presently effective
GT&C.
12.  Section 1.13. GTC.  Peoples agreed at the meeting that
the definition of GT&C  should be changed to end after the words "from time
to time". (This eliminates the refernce to  modification in Peoples' sole
discretion.)                                                           13.
Section 1.22 and 1.26. Peoples agreed that the definitions should refer
only to MEH and Peoples (and not to "controlled" persons)              14.
Section 1.15. Peoples agreed that the definition of Hub Capacity could be
changed to eliminate the reference to determination by Peoples in its sole
discretion. The determination should be "in accordance with the GT&C."
Peoples suggested that a standard of "good faith"  or "commercially
reasonable" would be acceptable.
15. Section 5.1. Peoples
agreed at the meeting that Section 5.1 could be revised to eliminate the
refernce to Laws and Judgments with a materially adverse effect. Peoples
agrees that there should be a representation that the Agreement does n ot
violate "any Judgment or Law applicable to it",as originally proposed.

16. Section 2.9. The discussion at the meeting indicated
that Peoples may accept use of a standard of "commercially reasonable" with
regard to its judgment under 2.9(i) and MEH's obligation to perform in
accordance with the Operating Statement, Laws and Judgments in 2.9(ii). I
was surprised that Peoples suggested this re 2.9. As I understand it, the
concern is that MEH should not be liable for contract damages in the event
that it acts in a commercially reasonable manner, but cannot, for some
reason, comply with the GTC or a Law or Judgment. I wonder if we can
accomplish this result with language in a later section of the Agreement
regarding liability. My concern is that a provision indicating that MEH's
responsibility for compliance with regualtory requirements, Laws and
Judgments is limited to best efforts or items it knows about may raise a
red flag for the regulators. I would like to discuss whether there is
another way to deal with potential liability without changing 2.9(ii) to
refer to "best" or "commercially reasonable" efforts. Let's discuss
tomorrow.                                17. Section 10.1. Filing for
Governmental Approval. At the meeting, Peoples indicated that, although it
believes it should have sole control over regulatory filings, Peoples will
agree to include a provision indicating that:"Prior to the filing of
applications, pleadings or testimony related to approval for operation of
the Hub, Peoples will provide copies of such materials to MEH, and consider
comments provided by MEH." We should discuss with the business peoples
whether this is sufficient, and how specific this provision should be. The
language here would be comparable to that inserted in 6.1 regarding the
right to review and comment on changes to the GTC.
18. Dissolution of
MEH. Peoples agreed that a portion of our proposed 15.1(f), up to the word
"terminated" on line 2 should be restored. Peoples only concern in
proposing deletion was that the LLC Agreement might be requested by the ICC
Staff due to the reference. As revised, the reference is removed.
19. Confidentiality. Peoples agreed to re-think the provisions of 17.1 re
confidentiality of the compensation provions of Articles 3 and 7. This was
not confidential in the NIGAS approval proceeding. Because the ICC Staff
will be aware of the provisions, I do not know why Peoples proposes to
require the procedures needed to maintain confidentiality of these
provisions in the approval proceeding.
20. Section 18.4. Peoples agreed to mutual review and agreement re
forward-looking statements re the Hub.                            21.
Section 2.4. At the meeting, Peoples agreed that the third sentence is
confusing and should be revised. I would suggest: " Peoples will inform MEH
promptly after it learns of information indicating that a revision to
information regarding Hub Capacity should be made or proposed in accordance
with this Section."
Tomorrow, I will re-review my notes to
make sure that I have covered the regulatory areas. I have notes on other
sections also if you have any need for them. I'll give you a call tomorrow
after I return from a morning hearing around 11:00am.

Ben:

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS.  In 
addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant 
level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the 
guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are 
required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) 
in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If 
we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes 
the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
>From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

Subject:  Re: Revised RM Policy

Per my voice mail, will you please take a quick look at my edits to Vlady's
draft risk management policy attached below.  I don't think any of them are
problematic, but Vlady has some concerns mainly because the base Enron
Corp. risk management policy was used as the template and therefore I am
effectively making edits to it.

I will be leaving the office today around 11:00 so I want to turn this to
Peoples before then if possible.  On any other business, I will be
unavailable from 1:30 to probably 3:00 today, but can be reached via pager
800-980-1771 or cell phone 312-925-8888 at any other time.

As always - thanks for your help.

Subject:  Re: Revised RM Policy  (Document link: Gregg Penman)

Some comments on your comments:

Section II:    I don't like the title "Commercial Development Manager" but
rather "Risk Manager"
Response:         The title Commercial Development Manager comes from the
MEH Operating Agreement.  We can amend the LLC Agreement  if necessary, but
it seems burdensome since the title is only a formality.  However, as
currently written, the Commercial Development Manager is the person
responsible for managing the daily business, i.e. similar to a desk
director.  In order to maintain control of this position, it can only be
filled by an Enron nominee and will report directly to the MEH General
Manager, Laura Luce of Enron.

Section VII:   Majority of the wording came initially from attorneys, I
would recommend confirming that.
Response:          I will run this by the attorneys.  However, from a
technical perspective, Section VII refers to employees of MEH.  No one in
the Chicago office is an employee of MEH, but rather we all remained
employees of our respective organizations.  I will ask the attorneys if we
need to limit all Chicago based employees, both of Enron North America and
Peoples Energy Resources.

Section VIII:  Who is the General Manager of MEH?
Response:          As mentioned above, Laura Luce, Vice President of Enron
North America
Is Enron North America Corp. a legal entity?
Response:          Yes, Enron North America Corp. replaced Enron Capital
Trade and Resources as the Wholesale business of Enron Corp.  Unless you
know something different, I believe that to be a true statement.

Let me know if any of my responses don't make sense or you still have any
questions.  I am still going to try to get this out by 10:00 or so.

Gregg

Vlady - As we discussed, I am attaching my revisions to your initial draft.
They are mainly cosmetic attempts to make the RM Policy terms consistent
with the MEH Operating Agreement and separate MEH from any behind the
scenes reporting or controls that ENA chooses to place on Richard/MEH.  Let
me know if you have any concerns about my edits.  I would like to send this
to Peoples end of day today.  I will follow up with Structuring to find a
body to model the underlying asset position.

Thanks - Gregg

Attached is a proposal that was shared with PERC last week.  We are now 
awaiting PERC's response.  I am assuming that they will agree to the terms 
since their alternative is to lose $ on the units at resale with no 
opportunity for recapture.  

I wanted to give you a "heads-up" since the timing will be is tight once I 
get the green light to proceed with legal docs.  Please let me know what 
documents we will need and how you suggest we expedite the process (LOI or 
otherwise).

Calumet Project Participation (with ABB's):
ENA has verbally told them we will not participate in Calumet and the LLC 
term to get to execution has expired.
Upon release by Laura/Ben - need to send them formal notice under the PDA 
that we are withdrawing our notice of interest to participate in Calumet.

Going Forward:
We need to put the general terms in the proposal into a formal document.  
Letter of Intent authorizing us to take control of the development/site sales 
process at our expense - if they the deal unwinds we get reimbursed for our 
direct costs spent to further perfect/sell their sites.
Assess PERC's legal position with ABB (was it fraud or gross negligence that 
ABB failed to mention this problem they've known about for 10 years?).
Authorization/indemnification from PERC to negotiate with ABB to grant 
contract concessions that will benefit Enron Canada as subsequent owner.
Enron Canada will likely be involved as lead negotiater with ABB - who in 
legal will work with ENA/Enron Canada on this ?

Timing:  
Enron Canada - To meet their 2001 schedule we need to have legal 
authorization to engage ABB by early-July.
"Pitch Book" - In its current form includes Calumet/Torrence we need 
authorization from PERC - Bruce is expecting to begin circulation by week of 
July 10th.
EPC contractors -  They bid Calumet using ABB, and we want them to re-bid for 
LM 6000's.  Need authorization from PERC (July 14th or sooner) with cost 
coverage provisions, since the EPC contractors are likely to want to charge 
us $50-$100k to re-bid the deal.

Matt - Thanks for the explanation.  That makes life much simpler, at least 
for now.  Illinois is currently the only state where we have employees or 
inventory.  We are merely purchasing and selling natural gas in the other 
locations.  If that changes in the future, I will let you know.

As always - thanks for your thorough review,

Gregg

Gregg:

We should register Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C. ("Midwest") for Sales & Use Tax 
in those states in which Midwest has nexus.  Nexus requires a physical 
presence (employees or inventory).  If Midwest, in foreign states (outside of 
Illinois), is merely purchasing and selling natural gas, for delivery by 
common carrier; Midwest does not have nexus.  Rather, Midwest is acting much 
like a mail order seller.  

In light of the above, could you please advise regarding Midwest's physical 
presence in Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and 
Wisconsin.  Thanks.

Texas, and Louisianna.  The remaining states in his e-mail are potential

Kay,

I have not yet heard back from Eric about this e-mail.  I was waiting for him 
to forward it to you with his comments, but understand from talking to Tom 
Suffeild that they're pretty swamped right now so I am forwarding it in the 
interest of time.  I believe that the outline below is a good starting point 
and that Eric will have be able to take the draft you build from it and add 
his conditions that they need to accept the deal.

Also, I have gotten a copy of the turbine purchase agreement and will bring a 
copy of it to you shortly.  Looks like we're not going to get this stuff 
inked this week - but it will probably heat up pretty quickly, so I wanted to 
give you this as a starting point.

Subject: PERC Turbine Purchase Agreement

Outlined below is the basis for the turbine purchase agreement between Enron 
and PERC.  Please review the bullet points and comment.  Eric will add to 
this outline and forward his comments to Kay Mann so she can begin to draft 
the agreement. 

Our plan is to present this document to PERC by Friday - assuming we can get 
it drafted and reviewed internally by that time.


This agreement constitutes a binding agreement - under the terms and 
conditions stated below - for Enron Canada Corporation ("ECC") to acquire a 
set of ABB/Alstom Power ("ABB") 11N2 single burner combustion turbines 
("Units") from Peoples Energy Resources Corporation ("PERC").
The obligation by ECC to acquire the Units shall be conditioned upon those 
items as further described below being met ("Conditions Precedent") by not 
later than September 1, 2000. 
ECC will acquire the Units through assignment of that certain Turbine 
Purchase Agreement ("Contract") between ABB and PERC dated __________, as 
renegotiated in accordance with the Conditions Precedent below, which shall 
include good faith negotiations between ECC/PERC and ABB in order to reform 
the Contract terms to better accomodate the use of the Units by ECC.
PERC and ECC hereby agree that ECC shall be authorized by PERC to negotiate 
directly with ABB in order to attempt to secure the Contract amendments 
described in the Conditions Precedent, and PERC will indemnify ECC from any 
adverse claims or causes of action against ECC as a result of those 
negotiations except and unless they are a result of gross negligence or 
willfull misconduct on the part of ECC.  
Further, prior to ECC entering into said negotiations with ABB, PERC shall 
secure written acceptance of ABB's agreement to negotiate directly with ECC 
and ABB's acknowledgement that they waive their rights to any recourse to ECC 
in relation to said negotiations.
Price:  The price for the Units - and all associated ancilliary equipment 
being provided under the Contract - is $56 million (US - a joke for your 
benefit Eric).
Term:  This agreement shall be in effect until the earlier of the following: 
(a) the formal transfer of title and contract takes place, or (b) September 
1, 2000.

Conditions Precedent:  

The above stated price shall include delivery to the Moore Project site at 
ABB's sole expense.
The exictor modifications required to make the Units operationally feasible 
in Canada will be made by ABB at no additional cost to ECC, and shall be made 
in the field or in the shop - at ABB's discretion - but in no case shall the 
delivery date of the units be later than November, 2000.
The repair/replace terms of the contract shall be modified such that ECC 
shall be able to opt - at their sole discretion - to replace parts versus 
repairing them, in order to maximize run-time (and the determination as to 
what maximizes run-time shall also be in ECC's sole discretion).
Eric,  I will let you fill in the blanks on the other conditions that you 
want changed in the contract.

I think I have captured the spirit of the deal here.  I have attempted to 
cover us for intervention/interference issues.  I am concerned about the Term 
provisions - how long do we want to keep this thing alive if ABB is unwilling 
to meet the terms we need to make this deal viable ?

Kay:

As we discussed, I have been working with a counterparty interested in 
purchasing one or both of ENA's Illinois development project LLC's.  The 
counterparty is listed below:
  PSEG Americas Development Company, L.L.C.
  35 Waterview Blvd.
  Parsippany, NJ  94105

The key points of the proposed transaction are:

1.  The transaction would be an outright purchase of 100% of the member 
interests in one or both of the following project entities:

 Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.
 Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.

2.  The purchase price of 100% of the member interests would be:

 Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.: $3,000,000.00
 Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.: $6,000,000.00

Lisa Mellancamp was the ENA attorney who handled the CA between ENA and PSEG 
before Christmas.  At the end of November, Lisa engaged Corey Brown at 
Bracewell & Patterson to handle the preparation of a draft Securities 
Purchase Agreement in conjunction with our discussions with Coastal Power.  
Corey prepared a draft SPA based upon an option to purchase structure, but 
Coastal Power backed away from the transaction in early December.

I have received a letter from PSEG Power LLC indicating their interest in 
proceeding with a transaction in the near future.  I will forward you a copy 
of this letter for your records.  They have verbally indicated that the 
Purchase Price(s) of $3 MM and $6 MM respectively, are acceptable to them.

I believe that this is the appropriate time to bring you into the process and 
transfer things from Lisa to yourself.  Please call me to discuss the SPA 
once you have reviewed the appropriate documents.  I will be in Chicago 
tomorrow.  I can be reached by cell at (713) 412-4612 or leave me a 
voicemail.  I will be in the Houston office by noon on Friday.

Thanks,
Fred

We should register Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C. ("Midwest") for Sales & Use Tax 
in those states in which Midwest has nexus.  Nexus requires a physical 
presence (employees or inventory).  If Midwest, in foreign states (outside of 
Illinois), is merely purchasing and selling natural gas, for delivery by 
common carrier; Midwest does not have nexus.  Rather, Midwest is acting much 
like a mail order seller.  

In light of the above, could you please advise regarding Midwest's physical 
presence in Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and 
Wisconsin.  Thanks.

Matt - Per our conversation today, the following e-mail was sent by Russell 
Murrell regarding the impending name change of Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C.  My 
understanding is that we have already bought/sold natural gas in Oklahoma, 
Texas, and Louisianna.  The remaining states in his e-mail are potential 
future places of business.  I will leave it up to your discretion as to how 
you want to pursue registering for taxes in these locales.  I am guessing we 
may want to register in those states we have already transacted in.  Please 
let me know what you think we should do.

Thanks,

Gregg

We will be doing the vast majority of our business in Illinois;  however we 
may also transact in Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas, Louisiana, 
Oklahoma, Kansas.

Thanks for your help.  Let me know if you need anything.

As we discussed, in an effort to forward our internal discussions and 
memorialize the results of our discussions in Chicago last week, Boyd and I 
have produced a new draft of the Agency Agreement.  The changes can be 
inspected by launching the attachment in Word and then going to Tools --- 
Track Changes --- Highlight Changes to display and print the changes in the 
document.

A number of questions must be addressed.  They include, in no particular 
order:

Can we delete the confidentiality article?

Is it commercially important to restore the langauge on displacement 
deliveries?

What will the compensation arrangements be?

Are we willing to deduct the administrative fee from the net cumulative 
revenues?  [Doing so "loses" us $10,000 a month.]

Will we collect accounts receivable directly or have payments made to a 
deposit account in which we will retain a security interest?

How should Section 2.9(ii) be recast to allay Boyd's regulatory approval 
concern?

Is the new Section 2.10 acceptable?

How must the agreement change to reflect the "two county" concern?

I look forward to discussing this with you at your convenience.  DT

I attach for your review the redraft of the Agency Agreement.  Changes can be 
viewed (or ignored) by turning on (or off) the Track Changes imaging in 
Word's "Tools" section of the menu bar.

By the way, I did not spell out the payment account mechanics, since I 
understood that these would require discussions between you and Peoples.  I 
will separately forward Boyd's analysis of the regulatory impact of sending 
invoices instructing shippers to make their checks payable directly to MEH, 
as agent, instead of directly to Peoples (conclusion: acceptable, but they 
might want to tweak the GT&C to reflect it).

Please call me if you have any questions whatsoever.

Thanks!  DT

Attached is the latest draft of the MEH Risk Management Policy.  It has been 
prepared in conjunction with and reviewed by Peoples' Risk Management 
department.  Judy Pokorny will be presenting the salient points of the Policy 
to Peoples' Risk Management Committee this week for their consideration and 
approval.  Subject to any feedback from the Peoples' Risk Management 
Committee, the Policy is near final approval.  Therefore, if there are any 
comments or questions, please direct them to either me or Judy, as 
appropriate.  

Thanks,

Kay,
As things continue to move ahead on the other doc's (with Greg), I would like 
to priority to go to getting the first draft of the transfer price agreement 
as soon as possible.  Per your note below, I think Monday could be feasible 
with the expectation to get a draft to Peoples before the end of next week.  
In addition, the below agreement will no doubt be edited in the next week.

Thanx,

Laura

Laura,

Here's the revised version:



Here's a compared version so you will know what I did:



I'll work on the transfer price agreement today or this weekend so we will 
have something to discuss.  

I'm planning on being in Chicago on Thursday if you would like to discuss any 
of these matters.

Kay

I spoke to Karen Way at Piper-Marbury-Rudnick&Wolfe and we decided that the 
best way to handle the document flow is for you to send the docs. 
electronically to Karen and she will Fed-X out the originals for execution to 
their attorney - Ed Legner.   Karen has dealt with Legner recently on Green, 
so she should be able to push him to move the ball so we can get this done 
quickly.

 We can also include a marked as draft hard copy for markups if he has a lot 
of changes.  Since he just reviewed the Green doc. very recently, it should 
be fine as is since we are only changing the following:

We want to limit the means by which we are able to get the option premium 
back to their not being able to convey the tract.
They have an imbedded "put" option on the house if we begin to build and 
haven't exercised our call.

The commercial terms are $4000 for 18 months, and an 18 month extension for 
another $4000,  Exercise price is $185,000.

Karen will get together a legal description that will suffice for purposes of 
this document.

Our goal is to get this inked in the next 5-10 days.

_______________________________________________________________

These are my comments re the draft Petition forwarded by Peoples on Friday:
(1) The Petition describes PERC in paragraph and refers to PERC in par. 3.
PERC, however, is not a party to the Master Agreement, and the Petition
does not discuss request any relief with respect to PERC. I don't see why
there is a need to reference PERC. (2) It is my understanding that, under
the Master Agreement, there will be two types of transactions: (a) simple
buy/sells at a clear market price; and (b) complex transactions with
sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures. As we have
discussed, the first type of transaction, simple buy/sells at a market
price fall under an exemption to Section 7-101's approval requirement (220
ILCS 5/7-101(4)). These types of transactions do  not require ICC approval
and MEH/Peoples are free to engage in such transaction now. I would suggest
that the Petition point this out, particularly if (as I suspect is the
case) MEH and Peoples are now conducting such transactions or may wish to
do so before the ICC acts on the Master Agreement. Because the Master
Agreement covers certain transaction which need approval and other which do
not, I would suggest that the Petition make this clear and request approval
only "to the extent required". (This was the language used by NIGAS in
seeking approval of a buy/sell agreement in Docket 95-0302.) (3) With
respect to the transactions which do require approval (the complex ones
with sharing arrangements, management fees and similar structures), the
draft Petition doesn't say much. It says (Par. 5) that transactions under
the Agreement will optimize the use of the gas supply and capacity assets
of Peoples and MEH; (Par. 9) that Peoples has similar master contracts with
non-affiliated entities; (par. 10) that the agreement will not interfere
with Peoples' operations; and (par. 10) that the Agreement is in the best
interest of Peoples and its customers. All of these statements are fine to
include, but the ICC is likely to want to know more about why the agreement
is in the public interest. Perhaps a sentence or two could explain how the
Agreement will optimize Peoples' use of its gas supply and capacity assets
(e.g., by using capacity which otherwise would be idle) and how this will
benefit Peoples' Illinois ratepayers (e.g., a credit to PGA gas costs).
Also, Peoples is asking that the ICC pre-approve an arrangement under which
the "details" of individual transactions will be filled in later. As I
understand it, the "details" will include such things as the level of
management fees and other compensation terms. To facilitate approval, it
would be best to have some sort of guideline to suggest to the ICC, i.e., a
management fee within a certain amount or percentage of a specified index
level. If there is an industry standard approach that could be referenced,
that may be of use. The Petition suggests that there are other Agreements
of this type with non-affiliates. Perhaps reference could be made to
pricing provisions under one or more of those agreements. If it is not
possible to be any more specific, I am concerned that the ICC may want to
wait and review individual transaction rather than giving blanket approval
without knowing more. (4) The ICC approval process can take 4-5 months
(sometimes more) to complete. The required approval time, however, can be
cut down significantly when the apprval filing includes a Peition and
supporting testimony that lays out all the information needed to conclude
that a proposed arrangement is in the public interest (the interest of
Illinois ratepayers). The Petition itself need not include all the details
(it need only lay out the case ingeneral terms). A filing package which,
with accompanying testimony, tells the full story will expedite the
approval process.

I am in receipt of the Fehr's comments to our option agreement.  In reviewing 
them, I have the following comments:

The paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon 
a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put 
option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues.  We 
carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this.    Also, how 
can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ?  I think we would 
need to say that "if we decide to build the plant after the option period 
expires, then that would serve to extend the term of this agreement, however, 
if the option agreement expires unexercised for a one year period then we 
won't be bound to the deal.  

If the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another similar 
paragraph in the document I don't have a problem with it, but "specific 
performance" scares me in general.  Your (collective) call.


Lets wrap this one up fast.  I want to resolve it soon so I can use it as 
leverage with Ledford and not have him influence them.  He picked a good to 
go on vacation, but is back in on Monday.  I also told the Fehr's that if we 
could do this before the 15th I would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000.  Since we 
were about five days longer than promised, I can justify the delay to end of 
next week, but I don't want them to think I was just blowing smoke on the 
extra $10,000.


Fred :  Refresh my memory on who I need to go to for the option payment check 
?

Attached is a quick pass at a template for the Midwest Energy Hub Cash 
Management Policy based on conversations with both Peoples Energy and Enron 
personnel.  I have tried to get down on paper all the issues and have 
included several bracketed items and comments that need clarification.  
However, I have undoubtedly missed some things and welcome any input. If 
everyone could provide me with their comments by Thursday July 6th, I will 
incorporate them and work with Kay to translate this into an executable legal 
document.

Thanks for everyone's assistance,

Ben:

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Pontiac TSS.  
Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission 
Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of 
receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the 
ComEd queue.  If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the 
ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
>From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

Cle and I wanted to add a few comments to Boyd's email:

1.     Section 1.6 (Cumulative Net Revenues).  As noted, MEH should be 
compensated in full (or be paid a reduced finders fee) for transactions it 
brings to Peoples during the term that may be performed after the term.

2.     Section 2.1.  MEH may want to ask for a termination right on the 
transfer of the Facilities.  Also, transfers should be prohibited unless the 
Agency Agreement is directly assumed on terms that are satisfactory to MEH.

3. Section 2.2.

They deleted the reference to our agency being an agency coupled with an 
interest.  An agency coupled with an interest exists when consideration has 
been given or paid for the right to exercise the authority, or if the agent 
is given an interest in the property with which the agent is dealing. A 
principal may not be entitled to revoke an agency coupled with an interest.  
I think we need to reach a meeting of the minds as to whether they will be 
allowed to modify or terminate the agency other than pursuant to terms of the 
agreement.

Their language states that Peoples' responsibilities as principal are limited 
to those set forth in the agreement.  We do not set those out, so we must do 
so if this limitation is to survive.  For example, we do not expressly 
obligate Peoples to deliver Hub Services in accordance with the GT&C and 
applicable law, to perform the contracts for Hub Transactions that it has 
made, to maintain its facilities in good repair, etc.  In particular, a 
principal has the following duties, among others, to its agent:  (i) the duty 
to furnish an opportunity for work (e.g., to supply hub services for sale), 
(iii) the duty not to interfere with the agent's work, (iv) the duty to 
indemnify the agent where (a) the agent makes a payment authorized or made 
necessary in executing the principal's affairs or a payment beneficial to the 
principal or (b) the agent suffers a loss which, because of their relation, 
it is fair that the principal should bear, and (vi) the duty to compensate 
the agent for performing requested services that are beyond the scope of the 
agency agreement.  We will need to determine exactly what duties should be 
expressly included in the agreement.

A gross negligence standard of liability is preferable to an ordinary 
negligence standard.

As noted, it is inappropriate to make the agent strictly liable for complying 
with the GT&C, since it may be vague, subject to conflicting interpretations, 
and subject to change at Peoples' whims.

4.     Section 2.10. If the concept survives, MEH should not be liable for 
accounts receivable in dispute, particularly where Peoples may be directly at 
fault for the nonpayment.  MEH should not be accountable for payment defaults 
by shippers who meet the credit standards that Peoples has historically 
applied.

5.     Section 3.2.  Ideally, the receivables held by MEH should secure the 
amounts owing to MEH.  Further, MEH should be empowered to apply accounts 
receivable toward the payment of taxes, Hub Shipper refunds, and reimbursible 
expenses.

6.     Section 5.1.  As noted, no materiality qualifier should apply to 
Judgments and Laws.

7.     Section 10.1.  As noted, I am uncertain how it can be determined which 
expenses are "incremental to" MEH's obligations.

8.     Section 14.1.  Clearly, (b) is too broad.  If the concept survives, 
MEH should be liable for taking action which it knows or reasonably should 
know exceed its authority.

9.     Section 14.2.  Section (i) needs to be restored, particularly in light 
of comment 3 above regarding common law duties of a principal.

10.     Section 18.3.  Peoples' liability for MEH's routine and extraordinary 
expenses should be negotiated between the parties.

11.     Section 18.14.  The new language should be dropped as too vague.

12.     Section 18.16.  This requires further explanation from Peoples.

David: Here are my comments re the Agency Agreement draft sent last week:
(1) Section 1.27. I would suggest replacing "in Peoples' sole discretion"
with "in accordance with Sections 6.1 and 6.2". This is more consistent
with the intent re changes to the Operating Statement. (2) Section 2.4.
Each one of the new provisions re nominations, (a) 1,2, and 3, ends with a
similar sentence: "Peoples will confirm these requests as soon as
practicable prior to such nimination deadline and shall enter any
nominations necessary by such nomination deadline." Should this be more
specific, perhaps something like : "Peoples will confirm acceptance of
these requests as soon as practicable prior to the nomination deadlione and
shall schedule such nominations prior to the dealdine."? (The wording for
no. 3 is similar to 1 and 2.)   (3) Section 2.9 (ii) From a regulatory
perspective, I prefer the bracketed language. As I noted regarding the last
draft, a regulator would be concerned with an agreement commiting only to
"commercially reasonable efforts" re compliance with the GTC, or a Law or
Judgment. (4) Section 2.10. There is a typo in the second line from the
bottom of 8, it's "remains" unpaid, not "remain". (note that this concept
of a Peoples credit policy is consistent with Peoples' rights re denial of
serivice under Section 8.2 of the GTC, which allows Peoples to refuse
service based on a credit analysis.) (5) Section 5.1. At the time of the
last draft, we discussed an additional representation for Peoples that "it
has provided MEH with a copy of the G&TC in effect as of the Effective
Date". This could inserted in 5.1 as (d), with a relettering of current d
and e. (6) Section 7.2 I don't think the second to last sentence will work.
This says that, if Peoples rejects an offered Extended Hub Transactions or
doesn't timely accept, it can't enter into a similar transaction with the
party involved for 6 months. The problem with this is that Peoples must
provided Hub Service under the GTC, except when a ground for refusal stated
in Section 8.2 of the GTC applies. The circumstances described in 7.2 are
not a legitimate ground for refusal. I beleive, however, that we get to the
same place if 7.2 were modified to require that Peoples pay MEH its
percentage of Cumulative Net Revenues in the event that a transaction
similar to one previously rejected for the same party is accepted within 6
mos. after termination of the Agency Agreement.  (7) Section 8.3.  Item
(vi) of the list of functions could be expanded to state: "assisting in the
pareparation and filing of requests for Governmental Approval in accordance
with Section 10.1 and/or the preparation of FERC reports that are required
in the ordinary course of business and not specifically requested by FERC."
I wan't sure of the intent re the last phrase of this. Does this mean that
if a Report is specifically requested by FERC, MEH would be paid separetly
for work on the Report? I would have thought that routine review of
regulatory filings and work on reports might all fall into the category
covered by the $50,000 payment, regardless of whether a particular report
is requested. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks

Hi Gregg,

Here is a new draft which incorporates comments that Boyd and I have made.  I 
haven't reviewed this version yet, but I wanted to get it to you asap. I 
would like to look at this draft before it goes to Peoples, and I'll give it 
priority for tomorrow am.

I spoke with Dave Gorde (RAC).  He is prepared to discuss line of credit/DASH 
at your convenience, although tomorrow he is tied up with PRC.

I'll go ahead and get a draft of a "simple" revolving line of credit doc 
started, unless you think otherwise.

Suzanne, please forward this to Jeff.  My email is acting up again.

Hi Jeff,

I thought I would pass this email along to you since you've been working on 
some of the aspects of the Peoples deal.  I don't want to interfer with 
whatever you have going on, but I'm happy to assist/participate in whatever 
way makes sense.

Subject: Affiliate Master Purchase and Sale Agreement

Here is some more info. regarding the Affiliate Master Purchase and Sale 
Agreement that is on the list.  

Attached is a draft agreement prepared by Simon Halfin at Peoples.  It is 
based on the 3rd party contract that Jeff Hodge is working on with Peoples.  
The agreement is intended to be a master contract that would facilitate a 
blanket of structured term transactions between the utilities (Peoples Gas 
Light and Coke Co. and North Shore Gas)  and MEH.  It will be filed with the 
Illinois Commerce Commission for approval.  My understanding is that the 
transactions will still be subject to the annual prudency process of each 
utility.  I am not sure your strategy on this one, but would think that a 
combination of you, Jeff Hodge, and Boyd would be most effective.  I 
understand that Dynegy and Nicor filed a similar agreement as part of their 
Hub Agency Agreement that Boyd has reviewed.  I am sure he can confirm that 
or not.

Thanks,

Gregg

Karen,

There are a few outstanding items missing on the Ledford and Fehr Option
Agreements.  They are as follows:

Ledford Property

1.   Steven and Lynn Ledfords's signatures were not acknowledged.

2.   Exhibit B (Grant of Easement Legal Description) was to be inserted.
Since it is our intention to have executed and record a Memorandum of
Purchase  Option and Grant of Easement, shouldn't we obtain from the
Ledfords: (i) a legal description of the easement; or (ii) a legal
description of the parent tract for      reference purposes; or (iii) a
property identification number of the parent tract at the very least to
include in the Memorandum?

Fehr

1.   No legal description (Exhibit A) was attached to the Fehr Option.  Do
you have a copy of the legal description?  Please advise.

I look forward to hearing from you regarding the above.

Thank you

Kathleen

Kay: At Gregg's request, I forwarded the comments to Jerry Fox, who is
handling this for Peoples. I spoke briefly with Jerry. He said he had
reviewed the comments and was in general agreement. He also indicated that
he needed more information to finalize the Petition. Although he hasn't yet
gotten back to me, I believe he is reviewing this. I plan to put in another
call to him later today.

Kay:

The tour we are conducting next week is designed to provide Livingston County 
officials with a first hand view of the Lincoln Energy Center in Manhattan, 
IL.

The scope of work which Piper Marbury (Mark Gershon, Karen Way) is working 
under is described below:
 1.  Interface with Livingston officials to determine appropriate invite list 
from Zoning Board of Appeals, Plan Commision, and County Board
 2.  Attend the tour on 8/22 (approx 4 hours) - Presentation to attendees, 
site tour, bus ride to and from Livingston
 3.  Handle follow-up issues/questions from Livingston officials

We conducted a similar tour for the Kendall County officals in June and it 
was very beneficial in terms of obtaining our local zoning and other 
approvals.  We are obviously hoping for a similar result with the Livingston 
County group.

Call me to discuss.

Fred

Hi guys,

I want to make sure that you are comfortable with whatever services are being 
provided by Piper Rudnick, so that there won't be any surprises when the bill 
comes in.  Could you give me a brief outline of their scope?  

Thanks,

Kay

Mason Hall,  Livingston County Coordinator, has confirmed that the County
Agriculture and Zoning Committee, other key County officials and staff would
like to join us for a tour of the Lincoln Energy Center on August 22, 2000.
Current plan is for a bus to pick up participants in Pontiac at 10 a.m. and
to  return by approximately 2:30 to 3:00.  Lunch will be served at the site.
Mason anticipates approximately 15 to 20 participants.  We are also planning
to invite certain Township and City of Pontiac officials and should consider
other potential invitees including neighbors and other politicians.

Attached are the clean and red-line versions of the ComEd Tolling term sheet 
on the Plano site.  I will fax the clean version to ComEd's wholesale group 
this afternoon.

I inserted a section on the last page related to finance/accounting issues 
which Buyer (ComEd) shall reasonably co-operate with.  I will meet with 
Herman Manis next week to discuss the specific issues/language needed to 
maintain mark-to-market viability.

The main goal of this term sheet is to guage ComEd's level of interest in 
buying capacity and energy from the Plano site, thereby mitigating the 
transmission risk and significantly enhancing the value of the site in a 
sell-down transaction.

Call me to discuss any of this information.

I enjoyed getting to know you yesterday.

By the way, I wanted to follow up on a few items related to the Hub 
transaction:

1. The competition restrictions commence August 10th (see the definition of 
"Restricted Period" in the agreement), but no DASH was circulated at the time 
the LLC agreement was signed.  I believe it was intended that some other 
approval/sign-off procedure would be implemented after the closing.  
Achieving the appropriate internal Enron sign-offs is critical, so please let 
us know what (if anything) we can do to assist in this process --- whatever 
it might be.

2. Our deadline for proposing a list of grandfathered contracts to PMW is 
June 25th.  That's a week from next Sunday, and it is the same date by which 
we are supposed to finalize the Agency Agreement.  Since it appears that 
Peoples does not expect to get back to us for at least a week on the Agency 
Agreement, we might want to think about amending the LLC agreement to push 
the deadline back.

3. Other matters on our "to-do" list include (i) filing qualifications to do 
business where necessary outside Illinois, (ii) providing each of Enron's 
restricted affiliates' marketing representatives with a copy of the 
Restricted Activities provisions, (iii) putting the member guaranty 
arrangements in place, and (iv) finalizing the Risk Guidelines.

4. Termination rights are triggered if we fail to meet the deadlines in 2 and 
4(iv) above.

Thanks!  DT

Per my voicemail, attached is a list of business items that need to get put 
in place in order for Midwest Energy Hub LLC to be fully operational.  There 
are probably others that I have missed and would welcome any additions you 
may have.  One thing I did not include was any internal Enron approvals, 
(DASH, Legal risk memo) that may be necessary.  

Call me when you have a chance to talk through the list.

Thanks,

Gregg

Sheila,

Attached is the edited Master Purchase and Sale document (AKA the "affiliate 
document") between PGL/MEH.  Please review and provide comments back PGL's 
attorney (Simon Halfin, (email: S.Halfin@pecorp.com, phone # 312-240-4411).   
Per Gregg Penman's reccomendation, please coordinate with Kay Mann on who 
from Enron is representing MEH on this document.  Gregg and I will be the 
commercial point contact for MEH and Dave Wear for PGL/NSG.

Again, once executed  PGL/NSG representative will petition the ICC for the 
right to buy and/or sell gas to an affiliate under this master contract.  A 
final decision/recommendation needs to be made if this document will be filed 
before or with the Hub Agency document.

Roy:

Attached for MEH's review is a draft Master Natural Gas Contract between
Peoples Gas and MEH.  This draft contract is based on the Master Natural Gas
Contract between Peoples Gas and EMW which was executed on June 30, 2000.
For your convenience, I have attached a compare of the two contracts.  As
you will note, apart from the addition of an ICC approval requirement, most
of the changes are of an editorial nature. Please note that this draft is
still subject to management approval.

Let me know if the form of this document is acceptable to MEH.  If you have
any questions, please call me.

Regards,

Simon Halfin

Kay:

This morning, Rusty requested that we prepare an Option Agreement for the 29
acre parcel west of the Livingston Energy Center.  This property could be
used as a construction laydown site, but more importantly would provide a
sound buffer for the project.  It is our understanding that the Option
Agreement is to be presented to the property owner at some point next week.
We will forward a draft of the agreement to you no later than Monday,
October 16, 2000.  Please feel free to call me or Don Shindler
(312-368-2175) with any questions regarding the agreement.  Best regards.

Kay:
The Village's attorney drafted the agreement and therefore we do not have an
electronic version -- unfortunately, he does not have email either.  The
redlined version you are reviewing now reflects only minor changes from that
originally executed by ENA approximately a month ago.  Please let me know if
I can be of any assistance.  Thanks!

Per our telephone conversation this morning, please send me a return e-mail 
granting me the authorization to amend the consents and amendment documents 
to reflect the change you requested from initial cap Enovate to lower case 
enovate on Name Change documents and Illinois qualification.  Please confirm 
which states marketing materials will actually as opposed to potentially be 
distributed in so that we may qualify in those respective states.  Since we 
can normally qualify an entity in states relatively quickly we will be able 
to qualify in states as need be.  Thanks.

In discussing the signing of Amendment #1 with Greg Penman, a couple more
changes were made to the document.  As reflected in the attached marked
draft, the signatories for each member have been changed, and a missing
quotation mark has been added.  Per my discussion with Greg, Peoples MW will
sign two copies and leave them with EMW in the Chicago office this
afternoon.

David,

Please change the date on the draft so that we won't confuse it with the 
prior drafts.

I would delete "specifically" from 2.10 (c), and add "or later ratify such 
transaction" (or something to that effect), just in case they later learn and 
accept the transaction.  

In 2.10 (x), add to "due to an inability to pay, or other credit reason".  In 
(y), add "or a contractual defense to payment" [could be force majeure, etc]

Again in 2.10, third sentence from the end "any interest, penalties, 
attorneys fees and court costspayable by the Hub Shipper...;

3.3  Delete "prior" before "approval", and add "or ratification" in the 
redlined section on refunds.


Thanks,

Kay

I spoke to Don Shindler about your comments.  We will hold the contract and
any discussions with the Seller's attorney pending your approval following
discussions with your Accounting Department.  As per Rusty's email, we will
provide for a 12 month post-expiration/termination extended triggering
period.  As to the specific performance issue, we have agreed to this in the
past after the exercise of the option in the event the ENA entity was in
default of its obligation to acquire the property.  The alternative seems to
be to provide for some additional payment as liquidated damages for a
failure to close over and above the option consideration.  Re:  the zoning
issue.  Fred:  if there is any thought to using the Fehr property as a
laydown construction site or other use, we will need to address this issue.
Let's discuss.  Please let us know how you would like us to handle this.  To
discuss, please call me or Don.  Thanks.

Here is some more info. regarding the Affiliate Master Purchase and Sale 
Agreement that is on the list.  

Attached is a draft agreement prepared by Simon Halfin at Peoples.  It is 
based on the 3rd party contract that Jeff Hodge is working on with Peoples.  
The agreement is intended to be a master contract that would facilitate a 
blanket of structured term transactions between the utilities (Peoples Gas 
Light and Coke Co. and North Shore Gas)  and MEH.  It will be filed with the 
Illinois Commerce Commission for approval.  My understanding is that the 
transactions will still be subject to the annual prudency process of each 
utility.  I am not sure your strategy on this one, but would think that a 
combination of you, Jeff Hodge, and Boyd would be most effective.  I 
understand that Dynegy and Nicor filed a similar agreement as part of their 
Hub Agency Agreement that Boyd has reviewed.  I am sure he can confirm that 
or not.

Thanks,

Gregg

Here's the Risk Management Policy Gregg has been working on for MEH.  

Jeff, I don't know if you have seen this, so I thought I would float it by 
you.

David, I'm sending it to you so that you can comment about any concerns you 
might have relating to the LLC agreement.

Thanks,

Mark,

I've reviewed the fax sent yesterday with the Proposed Conditions to Special 
Use for Livingston Energy Center.  Is Titan Land Development the Owner?  Will 
it be necessary for Titan to make the escrow payment prior to exercising the 
relevant land options and the commencement of construction?

I do not know whether these agreements and/or the making of the deposit would 
impact the balance sheet treatment, but I understand from Fred that we are 
not concerned about the balance sheet treatment for this project.

Kay

Subject: Livingston County Approval Issues - ISSUES FOR TODAY

As you know we are scheduled to appear before the Livingston County Zoning
Board of Appeals ("ZBA") tomorrow evening for initial approval of the
Livingston Energy Center (the "Facility").  Assuming, we receive a vote to
approve the Facility, the ZBA will be approving the Conditions of Approval
of the Special Use sent out yesterday for everyone's final approval and
sign-off.   Please note that we have incorporated into these conditions the
stormwater management conditions, township and county highway roadway
conditions, and other matters. If there are any changes or modifications to
these conditions, our ability to incorporate may be limited if they are not
received by 4pm today.  Of course, if necessary, we will attempt to make
modifications after that time.  

It is possible based on on-going negotiations with the County and our
neighbors that additional changes may be required today or tomorrow.  We
will of course contact you immediately if that occurs.  If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to call or email Karen or me.  Thanks.
