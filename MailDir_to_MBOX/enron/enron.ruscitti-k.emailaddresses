you obviously know the energy market better than most.  My guy at goldman,
Jonathan Raleigh, has been on calpine for 4 years and has killed it, so i'm
just following his lead. as for the futile leadership in ca, i agree.
wouldn't it be nice for you, me , tj, and sweets to run a company or a

I figured we all needed a break from all the 9/11 and Retaliation news we've received lately.

To get everyone in the postseason frame of mind here is a trivia question I'm sure will stump the most avid basebvall fan.

 

There has been an MVP who reveived the award two years in a row at each position (center field has two), including at pitcher.  Name them.  

I will share the answers in a future email.  I'm thinking Bert or DiLeo are the only ones who have half a chance at this one.  Prove me wrong.

Pitcher :

Catcher:

First Base: (no it was not Rich Kampmann)

Second Base:

Third Base:

Short Stop:

Left Field:

Center Field:

Right Field:

Subject: From an acquaintance



I just witnessed something I don't think I'll ever forget.  I was down near
the cafeteria in the Pentagon meeting a friend for lunch and I see a very
large crowd of people inside.  I walk in and soon find myself standing less
than three feet away from our Commander-in-Chief and right beside the
Secretary of Defense (and a bunch of Secret Service folks).

President Bush was walking around shaking hands and thanking all of us for
what we do.  He kept saying to people "Don't Worry" -- as if to say, I've
got it under control.  He must have shaken 1000 hands or more.  What
particularly struck me was his presence - not a particularly large man in
stature, but he had an aura of a giant - a smile on his face, yet you can
sense he was a man on a mission - a man of purpose and conviction - there
was just this feeling that he is ! THE MAN, and he is in charge - he had a
quiet confidence that was deafening!

Then, a group of folks just behind me started singing God Bless America
and, in no time, the entire room - which was packed - was singing the song.
It was enough to give anyone goose bumps.  If there was a dry eye in the
place, I couldn't see it (probably because my eyes weren't too dry).  It
was just one of those once in a life time experiences that I shall never
forget.  After God Bless America, there were a few chants of "USA -
USA-USA," followed by a lot of applause.

When President Bush finally made his way toward the entrance, he turned
with his confident smile and waved at everyone, and the room just erupted
in cheers and whistles and applause.  I've been to professional football
games where the noise wasn't that loud.  It was just such a wonderful
experience - and it made me:

1) So very happy that George W. Bush is our president and
Commander-in-Chief.
2) So proud to be an American.

Just thought I'd share.

Kevin: how did your house fare out during the rains. I heard there was localized flooding in Heights area. Our house and cars were all safe.

It was fun having dinner the other night. Say hello to Lisa...

Heidi Minyung Suh was born on July 2, 2001 at 12:57PM.  She is a beautiful, healthy little girl weighing 7 lbs 14 oz and 19.5 inches tall.  Both Heidi and mom, Sunnie, are doing very well.  Heidi sleeps and cries when she's hungry and wants milk all the time.  My first daughter Heather thinks Heidi is a play doll, and is somewhat jealous of the attention she's getting.  Our house in Seoul is quite busy with activity with two babies, my parents and Sunnie and I.  Yes, fellas, you can deny it, but you too will become fathers one day.  (Scary thought, eh?)   Apart from the lack of sleep and personal time, it's pretty wonderful!  The JV is doing well, although there's quite a bit of pressure to meet numbers this year.  Hope things are well in Houston for all of you.

Jung

Yo Kev,

What's happening? Hope everything is going okay. How is Lisa and the rest of 
the neighborhood?

It's starting to get cold here. The temperatures are in the high-40's.
Went to Notre Dame last week with dad. It was cool. The campus was 
beautiful; the ride wasn't that bad; and the people were REAL nice (how 
weird?!).

Anyway, dad had a good time, except I think he got pneumonia on the trip. 
"Mr. Sunshine" was dressed up in shorts and a golf shirt for a mid-October 
trip to Indiana. It was 75 degrees when we left Jersey and 45 degrees by the 
time we hit the Ohio border. He can't figure out how he got pneumonia (true 
story). Anyway, I saw him yesterday and he looks and sounds better.

Anyway, Gloria is busy coaching soccer. Her team is 9-4-1 (best record in 
school history). Tommy is busy causing havoc wherever he goes (Takes after 
mommy). His grandparents are driving mommy and daddy nuts (same ol' story).

I hope everything is going all right. Heard the big lobsterfest was a 
success (Nothing like a FRESH Maine lobster). Belated congrats on your first 
anniversary.

Is life pretty tense at Enron (with all the craziness of the world markets, 
terrorism scares and this Anthrax hysteria)? Do you have to go through a 
metal detector or anything like that?

Anyway, I saw Moeller was on TV. Never thought I'd be happy to see his ugly 
mug on the toob!

Well, I've got to go (I'm at work). Talk to you soon.

Love your brother,

PS. Mom and Dad are looking forward to THANKSGIVING with you and Lisa! (Some 
fun, eh?!)

Take care

O.K.
The lobsters are ordered and on the way. Enough were interested in
mussels and clams for me to add to order.
Are you all bringing:
Pete & Fernando           Potato salad
Lisa & Kevin                   Appetizers
Lewis & Laura                  Corn on the cob
Greg & Marion et al       appetizers?
Josette                             desert
Patricia                            chowder?
All                            booze
Patricia is thinking 6:30ish
Oh yeah, total with lobster, clams & mussels is around $35 per person.

SEE YOU MA?ANA

John

  Ed,

  Sorry, but I must concur with Mr.Claffey.

  I do believe the question posed asked to list specific outfield postions
(ie: Leftfield, Centefield and Rightfield) which your suprisingly quick
response failed to address.  Most of the great ballplayers played certain
"outfield" positions based on their fielding abilities or lack thereof to
play the other outfield positions.

  I'll let you slide (barely) on your broad references to "outfield" on
Roger Maris and Dale Murphy and Barry Bonds, however,

  No true baseball expert would ever be so casual as to list Mickey Mantle's
position as simply "Outfield"

  I believe you owe baseball fans, especially the Yankee snobs (I was always
a Mets fan) an apology for so boldly disrespecting the position of
Centerfield.

  Rob

Hi everyone,

I've traded in a view of the Gulf for a view of a Mobil station - welcome
back to the NE!  Now all I need to do is survive my first winter in 9 years.
I'll probably be bouncing back and forth between NJ and MD for the next
couple of weeks before taking a trip out to So Cal near the end of the
month. Test Pilot School and the pain begins on the 9th of July.

Hope all is well,

TJ,

Let me let you in on a little secret my man -- you ain't gettin' no break
from the Luke man when 2 pops out, nor are you getting a break from Luke
and/or Daniel Jr. when no 3 is born. There are no breaks to be had in the
parenting arena for about 20 years.

Point 2 -- It pains me so to make this statement, but Stamas might actually
be able to beat me in basketball now since I have no cartilage in my left
knee. The Dr. says that my running days are over (which was obviously a
serious blow to my lifestyle), but more importantly, he said that my
organized hoop days are history too. This is not to say that I can't
contribute the next time that we conduct a demonstration of our skills while
hung over at the Charlotte "Y", but it ain't looking good for me ever
swatting Stamas' ugly jumper into that pretty boy face of his ever again.
Then again, I'm crippled, not dead. Certainly elevation is not required to
stuff him so ... maybe I will.

Go Sooners!

Sweets

Gentlemen - I hope you all are doing well.  I wanted to follow up with
guys
on supper club.  I believe it's our turn in the "rotation".  ML and I
thought it might be fun to change it up a bit and go some place like the
Mucky Duck where we could eat and watch a band or go somewhere like the
Laugh Stop for dinner and a comedy hour.  We will treat on the dinner
and
first round of drinks.  I would say on all drinks but given Kevin's past
rampages with the bottles of wine I better not guarantee full payment of
that at a restaurant.  If that's a problem, I can always bring Kevin a
small
flask and straw that he can have during the night. 

ML talked to Lisa and I talked to Dax and it sounds like Sunday,
November
11th will be the only date that might work.  Follow back up with me and
let
me know if that will work.  Take care and talk to you soon.

good points and yes the Dow just needs one more week like this to trade
under 9000 so 8000 is not a stretch.   Markets typically predict a recession
long before it arrives.  In the second q of this year you will see some sort
of headline that says Recession hits US.  I would buy that day.  As for
california, the worlds 6th largest economy,  energy is obviously your space
but I think that the calpines, capstones, and others are options such as the
contract they received last month.  Hope all is well.  Sweets party was fun.
It was only missing you and TJ. j

In that case:
1. Guided tour of Enron Stadium
2. Chauffered transportation to/from Corpus Christi
3. A pound of fifties to spend over the weekend
 
I just checked w/ mapquest and they are estimating a whopping 6 hours for the drive!!!  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I seem to remember it taking about 3.5.
Lowery is doing some more training in San Marco, about 45 minutes north of San Antonio.  I imagine he was staying on the River Walk so he had something to do with Kim.  If he had any balls at all he'd stick around for the weekend.

After 3 years of Enron I have decided to make a change in career paths. Eff=
ective June 1, I will take over as the Director of Youth Ministries at Grac=

pportunity presented itself. Jamie and I decided that now was the best time=
 (no kids and no debt). The job also offers a full scholarship to Dallas Th=
eological Seminary, so now I can finish Seminary in 4 years instead of 7. I=
 have enjoyed working with all of you and wish you much success in the futu=
re.

Hope to see you at the Happy Hour Berney is throwing for me at the Blue Aga=

No, I didn't go to any parties,either, I started to, but since I had dinner
engagements the two evenings prior, I really wanted to see my boys before
they went to bed! I almost walked into the Amoco party, but only to eat
their food and drink their beer! But then I knew that I would go to the
Torch party and wish I hadn't! Who is Torch, anyway? Where was the Enron
booth? That's like 3 years in a row that Enron hasn't participated! Why is
that? Is it the Enron culture, not to participate in gas functions? Are you
strictly going paperless and wireless? Broadband and such? What do the
troops around you say? Does anybody think it is rather odd that you don't
do that? Just curious, I personally don't give a flip. I went to lunch with
somebody that said Enron had a party Tuesday night. Where was my invite?
Y'know, it's kinda funny because I never really get invited to parties like
Williams or Reliant or Conoco, and the sad thing is, I don't care. Why is
that? So many people make such a big deal about getting hammered when they
go out, I guess I'm just getting old!

     Well, I've got to go out again and treat some mullet to dinner again!
I can't wait for all these people to leave, so I don't have to keep
smiling, keep eating and getting little sleep! OUT!

Did you go to any parties last night??  I was lame, I didn't go to a single

there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to
you much
since you've become a big ICE trader.   Talk to you soon.

Dear family and friends,

My contact information is changing.  You won't be able to reach me at this
email address and the work numbers below much longer, as Adaptive Broadband
has filed for bankruptcy.  It's been a long time coming, and I'm already
into my job search, but I'm going to enjoy some time off while I look.

I will be checking the phone and email at work infrequently, and the new
contact information is a better way to get in touch with me.  I'll send
another note when I have a new job.

tsarhatt@yahoo.com

(650) 357-0827  -  home

As I watched the Lakers pound that Texas  team?oh yeah, San Antonio, I was thinking about the guy Mr. Ruscitti refers to  as "my boy."  As I'm sure you were  both otherwise occupied, you probably missed my boy in action this  afternoon.  He was on what he  termed a "power walk (catchy, don't you think?)," going door to door with  power-saving light bulbs, which he was handing out free of charge to  "emphasize our need to conserve energy."   Boy, my boy is one powerhouse.   You think we could bottle what he's  got?

Dr. Ruscitti:
 
You never responded to my last e-mail lo those many months ago.  How are you?  I hear you're a big fan of Gray Davis.  One thing you can say about Gray, he's colorless.  The poor dishrag is laying the blame at you Texans' feet.  But then, why not?  If I have to listen to G. Bush talking about "nucular" power much longer, I'm going to blame everything on Texas.
 
How's marriage?  How's Enron?  I hope all's well, and that you're about to expand your family.
 
If you have any news, or plan to be out this way, please look me up.
 
Best,
 
Tim

Kamp,

I think you have to give up on your dream of being a game show host.
You certainly have the teethy smile,  but you display too much
confidence that you are  the only one with the Top-Secret answers.
