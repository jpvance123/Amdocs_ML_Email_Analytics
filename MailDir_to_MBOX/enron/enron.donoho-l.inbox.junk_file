Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.  The company code is 179E.

The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.  

With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:
 
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.  No changes here.
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.  For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.  These "5" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.  You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).  
If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.  During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.
If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.  Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate "5" series cost center on company 179E.  

If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 11	
>From 5:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m., the Envision team will perform hardware maintenance on the Envision system.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16

>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

Ramona,
The meeting requested today was not about the Topock point but about the Socal Window, even though the conversation did migrate to the Topock issue. 
I will come by and update you on what Lorraine spoke about so let me know when you will be available, I will also include you on any future meetings.

John Buchanan

Lindy & John,
I understand that marketing had a meeting on this issue today with the Gas Logistics team. Could you please include me & keep me in the loop on this issue since we could have system issues.

Thanks Ramona

I think we can get with Ramona and Mary Draemer to discuss.  They may just be able to work it through their contacts at SoCal.  I do think we will want to run the posting past SoCal before we put it out there.

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

As a follow-up to our meeting last Friday, I have reviewed the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement (CSA), SoCalGas System Adequacy proceeding testimony of Lad Lorenz and the CPUC Dec. 11, 2001 Decision on Unbundling the SoCalGas system by implementing the CSA with modifications.  I also have a call into Rodger Schwecke at SoCal to discuss their upcoming tariff filing and the related capacity issues.  Some of the pertinent points made in these documents relative to receipt point capacity and allocation are as follows:

Comprehensive Settlement Agreement

Appendix B outlines the details of backbone transmission/receipt point capacity rights:
	
1. All receipt points will be defined with firm capacity and primary access rights that reflect physical limitations.  The Appendix B table of receipt point capacity indicates that for No. Needles, Transwestern has Primary Access Rights of 750MMcf/d and Mojave at Hector Road has Secondary Access Rights.

2.  For interconnects into SoCalGas with more than one upstream pipeline, secondary access rights will be defined.

3.  New or expanded interconnects with existing or new pipelines will have secondary access rights only and will be subject to bumping by gas scheduled through primary access points.  

In the text of the CSA, the Open Season procedures for intrastate backbone transmission/receipt point capacity are described in detail.  Briefly, its proposed to work as follows:

1.  Initial Reservation for Core customers.  SoCalGas Acquisitions, core transport agents and wholesale customers serving the core will be provided a set aside amount of capacity.  This included 300MMcf/d at North Needles.

2.  First Stage/Phase I of the Open Season for 50% of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside.  Existing noncore customers may bid on any RP capacity up to 100% of their historical usage.

3.  Second Stage/Phase II of the Open Season for remainder of Phase I capacity, if any, not awarded or allocated.  Available to same existing noncore customers as in Phase I to bid on in this second round if they haven't been awarded capacity up to their 100% historical usage.

4.  Third Stage/Phase III of the Open Season for 50% of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside plus any remaining capacity not awarded in Phases I and II.  Bidding open to any existing or new customers with creditworthiness established.

5.  SoCalGas will hold annual open seasons for expired or non-contracted available capacity.

6.  Market concentration limits were set such that no person or entity including affiliates may hold more than 40% of the capacity (after core set aside) at any one receipt point awarded through the open season process.  This does not include secondary market capacity or individually negotiated contracts acquired after the initial open season.

Examples of North Needles capacity:	Physical capacity	750 MMcf/d		Add'l 25/50	775/800
					Core Cust. set aside	300			Inc. core	313
					Avail. Cap. for bidding	450					462/487

					Phase I  avail. cap.	225					231/243.5

					Phase II avail. cap.	remainder of 225			remainder of
													231 or 243.5

					Phase III avail. cap. 	225 + remainder 			231/243.5 +
								of Phases I & II if any.			remainder of 
													Ph. I & II if any.

System Adequacy Proceeding--Lorenz Testimony

Lad Lorenz testifies that the proposal to allocate firm receipt point capacity on the SoCalGas system is intended to be used "until the commission acts in the GIR proceeding".  

In Section H. of Lad's testimony on Firm Receipt Point Access, Table II illustrates that North Needles will be expanded by 50MMcf/d to a level of 800.  In Table III under the heading of Firm Primary Access it states "TW--who then allocates among its shippers" in reference to the 800MMcf/d of capacity listed for North Needles.

In this same Section H, Lad states that this alternative proposal for allocating primary firm capacity at each receipt point will achieve improved reliability "until the Commission acts to approve the CSA".

CPUC Decision 01-12-018 on SoCalGas Unbundling

The Commission approved the CSA on Dec. 11, 2001 with certain modifications.  These modifications included:

1.  Market concentration limits were decreased from 40% to 30% and included capacity attained in subsequent open seasons or by individually negotiated contracts.  Secondary market capacity remains excluded from the market concentration limit.

2.  A secondary market price cap was established at 120% of the interruptible rate ($.07191).

3.  Reinstated the core reservation for intrastate capacity at 1044MMcf/d (CSA lowered it to 1000).  This explains why the core reservation for Needles is 313 and doesn't match the TW/SoCal contract level.  The additional 44 was allocated per a Calpine proposal on a prorata basis to each receipt point with Needles receiving an additional 13MMcf/d.

In the summary and conclusion sections of the Decision, SoCalGas was directed to include the additional 375MMcf/d of new backbone and receipt point capacity in its open season.  This part of the Order did not provide any direction as to how the new capacity was to be allocated to upstream pipelines.  Additionally SoCalGas was directed to file an advice letter for implementation and to include proposed methods for allocating any additional future capacity additions.

Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an "average rate" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.

On slide # 17, as we discussed yesterday, I think we'll have to do without the 2001 throughput numbers because the FERC Form 2's aren't published yet for 2001.  We could update the presentation when the numbers are published.

On slide # 28, there's a note at the bottom "% of Revenue".  What do we need here?  Do I need to get you a number(s)?

For ACA, yes, we have to pay the FERC based on through-put out of the system.  Therefore, we do not discount it; it would be lost revenues.  

For the GRI surcharges, it is up to us (Transwestern) whether we discount them or not (not the Shipper's choice).  You are right, Lindy; we only remit to GRI what we collect.
Therefore, we can discount the GRI surcharges all the way to zero.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Jeanette.

This is my understanding too.  We can discount GRI away and we only have to pay the Gas Research Institute what we collect.  We have to pay the ACA, if we discount it away.

The GRI is a voluntary surcharge that the Shipper indicates they want to pay.  We just collect it and pass it on to the Gas Research institute.  The ACA is an Annual Charge Adjustment to recover cost charged to us by FERC.  We typically do not waive or discount this charge.  The other surcharges are due to past settlements and are not applicable to new expansion projects.  These are defined in the Tariff in sections 21 and 23 of the General Terms and Conditions.

Jeanette:

I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.

Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.

Thanks!

As we work through all the assumptions on the 10 year Plan info for Stan, it would be helpful if I (or a member of my staff) could be involved in the specific discussions as to what the assumptions are that are being considered. Although we have been involved in some of those meetings it appears that significant changes have been made at the last minute without ever being discussed with the Commercial Group. If I am to be responsible for answering questions as to the details then I would like to provide input prior to any future meetings with Stan on these issues. 

There are several areas that I would like to sit down with you to discuss:

-First, I would like to see the forward curves used to price capacity from '06 going forward;

-Once we have the forward curves from now to '06, I would like to see those also (if we thought those prices didn't look good then how do we justify assuming resubscription at Max rates going forward?) Is Max for both East and West capacity at the same time a good assumption? The market has never allowed that kind of deal structure; 

-What expansion scenarios are we assuming? I understand that they were changed sometime today yet I was not told what is in the current plan;

I would like to be able to put together the most beneficial and realistic plan for TW going forward as we all have the same interests in mind. Thanks.

Steve

Attached is the preliminary January California monthly report for your review...our last one, yeah!!!

TK - Please review/verify the rates that I have highlighted in pink.

I have already spoken with Terry regarding 3 days where I noticed discrepancies between total scheduled in TMS vs website posting and have determined the correct number to report.  All other data looks very similar to previous reports filed.

Please provide any comments or updates that may be necessary by COB February 22nd.

 


Thanks,
Elizabeth

I've attached Michael's most recent version (from Friday) of the PowerPoint presentation I put together and I've incorporated Tracy's comments (from yesterday).  Ron Matthews had drafted a history for Tracy - it appears on a slide in the presentation.

This is all we have as far as a basic overview and history.

I didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday, so I'll ask you.  Is Gina Taylor's group working on a draft of the Business Plan?  I understood from Tracy in our meeting with Steve last Friday that someone in Gina's group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation.  Do you know if that's happening?

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.

FYI - I just reviewed the preliminary invoices for the global settlement contracts (8255, 20715, 20747, 20748, 20822, 20834, 20835, 21165, 21175, 25923, 25924, 26371, 26372, 26677, 26678) and the capacity release contracts (releasing and acquiring).  Everything looks good, including the necessary adjustments identified below.

If you need further assistance, please let me know.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Texaco K #25923/25924 Comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4.5% between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes, there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding.  Need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes; and if delivery makeup scheduled, then invoice should be adjusted accordingly.

Please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2/26/02.  I will review again on the 1st.  

Schedulers -  Please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and Marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [some contracts are based on calculations, especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage].

Lindy,
I have made a few suggestions to your letter please review, I wanted to make clear that TW would accept nominations as usual but it would be SoCal's decision to only confirm beginning at the evening cycle. I hope it did not add a negative connotation to your letter because I know you want it to be positive so do not feel obligated to use my suggestions.
I have talked to Mary Draemer about the EDI issue and she will give me a date that TW can start accepting confirmations from SoCal via EDI for the Topock point. Before EDI starts the point could be manually confirmed. 

 


Thanks: John Buchanan

I think it makes sense to get together either later today or tomorrow morning to go over the forecast.  Given that Tracy is out, I don't want anything to slip through the cracks.  Except for a 3-4 meeting, I am free after that.

 << File: TW.model.r0.8.xls >> 
Here's the current rev on the tw model, with two key things that I need you all to review for me.  Please don't distribute to the large group until it is reviewed.

First, Lindy I have put the annual strip prices at the bottom of the "rolloff" tab.  Could you fill in the basis spread pricing that would result from this?

Second, Kevin and Rod - I had to give up on the FVA adjustments made in older models, I just couldn't get it.  Here's what I did; please let me know if there is something wrong with the analysis:
?	IBIT has annual FVA subtracted from it
?	Cash taxes are calculated using IBIT - Interest + FVA + tax/gaap depreciation adjustment
?	GAAP taxes use IBIT without FVA; deferred tax is GAAP-cash tax.
?	Net income is IBIT less GAAP taxes (therefore includes FVA amort)
?	Net Plant includes PP&E depreciation + FVA amortization
?	Retained earnings are standard - old RE + NI - Div's.

In the old model there were tax adjustments, pluses & minuses to equity, deferred credits, & current liabs that just didn't make sense to me.  I hope I've captured the theme of FVA (non-cash charge to NI, not deductible for tax) without the complication.  If not I can add it all back.

Best-
Davis

Here's what I noticed in researching the points listed below:

500540	El Paso Blanco I/C			San Juan 2 ReceiptsDelivery		Should not be added to a template since they were set up 
												as alt pt on each contract (until we move to new system)

3531	TW/NNG Beaver				Panhandle Deliveries			Already exists under PHDEL template
500176	Dale Ferguson Tap			Panhandle Deliveries			Needs to be added to PHDEL template
500203	Continental Follette			Panhandle Deliveries			Needs to be added to PHDEL template
500390	Sum WTG Delivery Pt 			Panhandle Deliveries			Already exists under PHDEL template

Lindy - Could you verify if POI #57096 is still valid for any reason?

Ramona - It appears that some of these points are available for displacement.  In the new system, Linda indicated that a separate group has been set up for any points you have identified as valid.  I will assume then that these should not be added to the paired template (ie, if a delivery point allows displacement, then they will only be added to the related basin delivery template.  Nominating this point as a receipt would depend on the displacement grouping defined in the new system for pools and interruptibles.).


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	TW Contract Template Clean-up

In cleaning up some template information, the following points were found to be on no templates. 

	1. Do they belong on a template?
	2. Is the template listed the correct one?

Unless I hear differently, I will go ahead and update the templates accordingly.

I have set up new groups for TW in the PLE system that emulate the templets in CBS.  I would like to get together with you and review the lists or give you a copy and have you review them.  Do you have some time this afternoon for me to come down with the lists?  Let me know.

Thanks

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

FYI--Below is the Press Release regarding Com. Bilas' resignation from the CPUC for health reasons.  With the upcoming elections, appointment of a new Commissioner will most likely become another campaign issue for discussion.  gh




February 27, 2002 			PUC:  	19	
Media Contact:  PUC Press Office - 415.703.1366 - news@cpuc.ca.gov				
				
PUC Commissioner Richard A. BIlas RESIGNS
	Commissioner Richard A. Bilas of the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has resigned from the PUC, effective at the close of business on March 8, 2002.  
	In a resignation letter to Governor Gray Davis, Commissioner Bilas said that concerns about the health of himself and his wife have made it impossible for him to adequately and effectively serve as a Commissioner.  "I am thankful for having been able to work in a policy making position in California," said Commissioner Bilas.  "I hold only good memories of the experience."  Commissioner Bilas' term was set to expire on January 1, 2003.
	Fellow Commissioners expressed comments on Commissioner Bilas' resignation: 
"I enjoyed working with Commissioner Bilas and I wish both him and his wife well," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC. 
	"I'm sorry to hear of the Commissioner's resignation," said Commissioner Henry Duque.  "He has been a great asset to the Commission, and I will miss him."
	"I am sorry to hear of Commissioner Bilas' resignation," said Commissioner Carl Wood.  "I wish him and his wife good health."
	"I am sorry to see Commissioner Bilas leave," said Commissioner Geoffrey Brown.  "He was a major force on the Commission.  His intellectual critique was always brilliant and he will be greatly missed."
	Commissioner Bilas was appointed to the PUC on January 1, 1997, by Governor Pete Wilson.  On February 1, 1998, he became Commission President and served in that capacity until March 2000.

Denis, the following needs to be put immediately under the population/degree day table in the TW writeup to be consistent with the other regions.

Population data is from the US Census Bureau 2000 Statistical Abstract of the United States.

If you could help me with a couple of pieces we will be moving in the right direction.     I am looking for a history of TW and some basic overview stuff.

I didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday, so I'll ask you.  Is Gina Taylor's group working on a draft of the Business Plan?  I understood from Tracy in our meeting with Steve last Friday that someone in Gina's group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation.  Do you know if that's happening?

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.

Thanks for attending the meeting this morning.  I hope it was useful.  As we discussed, I have added 3 slides to the end of presentation analyzing the west contracts by season and by month excluding the 13 month blow out period.  The new slides are pages 46-48.  The entire presentation is attached.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

My question on slide 11 may be an issue of units.  If the increase is from 6400 MMcfd to 7500 MMcfd, should the increase amount be 110 MMcfd vs 110000MMcfd?

Separately, on slide 14, can you tell me how the 2.4% decline is calculated?  If it is based on the 4.3 Bcfd down to 3.5 Bcfd shouldn't it be a 1.8% decline?

Thanks,

Michael

The note "need to verify" appears on this slide, after the bullet "110,000 MMcfd annual average increase".

I calculated this average annual amount from the first bullet "CA's natural gas use will increase from 6,400 MMcfd in 2000 to 7,500 MMcfd in 2010".  The first bullet and the third bullet are from the same source as the graph, The California Energy Commission.  Specifically, it's from their "California Natural Gas Analysis and Issues" Staff Report, dated November 2000.  The CEC's more current report from October, 2001, did not include specific long-term demand projections (it is focused on infrastructure issues).

That's the source of the numbers on this slide.

Lorraine,
	This is Southern's Gallup contract.  I've looked at our yellow file we keep down here and the original agreement only allowed alt RP's & DP's within the path, in the direction of flow, at the discounted rate.  Then, I see an amendment to allow them alternate DP's at the CA Border.  I don't see anything else here.  Are you aware of any deals that allowed them to use alt RP's in East of Thoreau?

Ramona,
	Can you ask Dennis to look in Envision &/or pull the official contract file for you and check to see if there are any other amendments? 

Thanks, 
Lindy

Lindy.

While testing the TMS nomination and scheduling processes that Interface into the new CMS system, I have found a TW Firm contract with Southern Energy Inc. # 26719 that was set up back in May or June of 2000 which has several alt. receipt templates that are outside the primary path. The primay path for this contract is San Juan Bloomfield receipts to Socal Needles as primary delivery. It shows up in production with alt. receipt groups in Central, West Texas, and Panhandle. Is this correct?

Thanks Ramona

We sincerely regret to inform you of a tragedy that occurred earlier today.  Cliff Baxter passed away this morning.  Cliff gave many years of dedicated service to the company and his spirit and wit will be remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Cliff's wife, Carol, and his two children, J.C and Lauren.

We know many of you will want to do something for Cliff's family.  We will notify you as soon as possible about the Baxter's wishes.

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective March 1, 2002 forward. 

A couple of things to note:
ENA's capacity on K #24924 was successfully released for March with TW collecting marketing revenues.
PG&E released a package of gas for 20,000/day from Bloomfield to CA at a fixed rate for the period 6/1/02 - 10/31/02.
PG&E also has another package of gas that will be posted next week.  Tentative terms of the deal are 20,000/day at a fixed rate for the period 6/1/02 - 10/31/02.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-
Davis

Earlier today, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message.

------------------------------------------------------
Voicemail Transcript - Steve Cooper
February 14, 2002

Hi everybody, this is Steve Cooper.  It is February 14, so Happy Valentine's Day to everybody. I just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - I want to make sure that I keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what's going on.

First of all, I want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails.  They've been very supportive and I thank you for that.  I do intend to get back to everybody personally -- I've just been busy and jammed up this week, but I do want you to know I really appreciate it.  It's been a little hectic this week, so I do apologize for the delay in getting back to you.

Anyway, a couple of things have happened this week and I just want to make sure everybody understands what they are.  Number one is the result of the special investigative report.  We're beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result Rick Buy and Rick Causey's employment with the company has been terminated.  To the extent that there are any additional changes, obviously I'll keep you up to speed.

We're also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the Board.  Six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days.  We're initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors, which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted.

At the Board meeting this week, I reiterated that it's my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor's committee by the second quarter, and nothing that I see today leads me conclude that we can't make that schedule.  I continue to believe that there is a very nice re-organizable platform here, so that the company can move forward.

There was some bad news with respect to Enron stock.  As far as I can tell, the claims base here - that is bank debt, bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward.  As a result, it's not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders.  That's not good news.  It's an unfortunate result of this problem, and I wish it was different.  But I don't want you to be misled and I don't want any of you to believe that there is value there, because I don't think there will be.  In particular I don't want you to continue to invest your earnings in Enron stock without being aware of, at least in my view, shareholder value at the end of the day.

The media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation.  I don't believe that will be the case here.  I think we have a tough road to hoe.  I think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team.  None the less, I do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here, and I'm absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen.

A couple of other things that I want you to be aware of:  as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team, we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles, responsibilities are.

We are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program, which I know is important to all of you.  As that gets cemented, I will provide you with additional updates.  

And another thing, I've asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid-March, an employee meeting at one of these local hotels.  It will, more likely than not, be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go.  What I thought we would do is give everybody, in a plain vanilla way, a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there.  Then we will have a giant question and answer session, so that if any of you have concerns, issues, problems, or upsets, we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things.

That's where we stand as of Valentine's Day.  Once again, I would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support. Again, I apologize that I haven't been able to get back to you as quickly as I would like, but I promise you I will and I hope everybody has a great day.

If you have any questions or issues, send me an email, give me a buzz or drop by my office.  I would be more than happy to have a chat with you.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Thanks again so much and I'll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible.

Attached are the preliminary reports ready for your review.

Jan - Since, TK is out of the office, could you please let me know what the daily rates [associated with deliveries to California only] are for contract 27161 (USGT) and 27495 (Astra).  

All - Please review the footnotes under Item 3 to make sure the descriptions related to changes in operational capacity are accurately stated.


Due to people being out of the office for the upcoming holidays and vacation, please provide updates/comments by COB on Friday, 12/21/01, so I can incorporate and forward to Omaha for filing with the FERC. 

 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

On slide 28 the graph is a percent of what?  Is it revenue or something else?

On slide # 17, as we discussed yesterday, I think we'll have to do without the 2001 throughput numbers because the FERC Form 2's aren't published yet for 2001.  We could update the presentation when the numbers are published.

On slide # 28, there's a note at the bottom "% of Revenue".  What do we need here?  Do I need to get you a number(s)?

Due to the President's Day Holiday on next Monday, February 18, Steve will hold his staff meeting on Tuesday, February 19, same time, same location.

As a courtesy to all attendees, Steve is asking, once again, that all participants arrive by 2:30 pm allowing for a prompt start time and for discussions to flow in an effective manner.    Your contributions to the discussions are crucial and deserve to be heard by all concerned.  Achieving this objective is why we ask your cooperation.

Because our attendee list has grown significantly in the past few months, arrangements have been made with facilities to have a standing order of chairs available for your convenience.

Please call if you have any concerns or questions.

The TCR II surcharges are only charged on 20747 and 20748, the mainline contracts, not 20835 (it is a SJ contract).

I guess Conoco CR #20835 would also be billed the TCR surchage beginning March, 2002.

Let me know if you agree.

Thanks again!

Jeanette:

I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.

Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.

Thanks!

The GRI is a voluntary surcharge that the Shipper indicates they want to pay.  We just collect it and pass it on to the Gas Research institute.  The ACA is an Annual Charge Adjustment to recover cost charged to us by FERC.  We typically do not waive or discount this charge.  The other surcharges are due to past settlements and are not applicable to new expansion projects.  These are defined in the Tariff in sections 21 and 23 of the General Terms and Conditions.



Lindy

Did I state this correctly.  Please let Eric and me know if I miss stated anything.

James,

On Sun Devil, are we required to collect GRI, ACA, or any other surcharges?  If so, how are they applied?  If not, why?

Lindy, 

Michael sent me this draft today, but I think that you should review these slides since I know that you have been working on this.  Let's discuss in the morning.  Tuesday is my last day before I leave on vacation.

Thanks, Kim.

You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.

For instance:

Risks:
Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market


Rewards:
expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position)
better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer
more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities)
Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila


Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

Regards,
Mansoor Abdmoulaie & Perry Frazier

RE: NORTH AMERICAN REGIONAL FLOWS


Lippman Consulting, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has expanded the 
Western North American Supply Movement report and renamed it the North 
American Regional Flows. We have divided North American into 16 regional 
areas including Canada and Mexico. This monthly report will capture the 
volumes flowing from region to region. At this time we have complete data on 
the flows for regions 1 through 8 and incomplete data for flows from regions 
9 through 12. As we expand our pipeline coverage, we will continually update 
this report with our expanded coverage. Attached for your review, is the 
update map showing flow for the month of December, 2001. The full report also 
contains a data base with three years of historical flow for each of the 
points shown on the map.    

The cost for this report is $160 per month on an annual subscription or the 
report can be purchased on a one-time basis for $480. If you would like 
additional information or to order the report, please feel free to contact me

Lindy,

While testing the new CMS TW contract system, we have come across situations with the firm contracts & PNR points. We need to know how marketing sets up the PNR points on firm contracts. 

Do you want all valid PNR points within the path, to be added as alternate receipt & delivery points  on every firm contract or do you add the PNR points only on request form the customer? Looking at most of the Firm contracts in production today, I do not see many PNR points attached as alternate points.

Please let us know how we should handle PNR points for firm contracts?

Thanks Ramona

Can you roll each of the expansions that we discussed into Rod's project model? Michael Ratner will then link those into the TW financial model.

Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an "average rate" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-

I've attached Michael's most recent version (from Friday) of the PowerPoint presentation I put together and I've incorporated Tracy's comments (from yesterday).  Ron Matthews had drafted a history for Tracy - it appears on a slide in the presentation.

This is all we have as far as a basic overview and history.

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

					In a scenario vaguely reminiscent of the California energy crisis,
most of the news focuses around one big story- the continuing Enron saga. 
There&#39;s no lack of stories about the Enron disaster, and each one
seems to be more dire than the last.  With Congressional probes, security
guards posted at Enron&#39;s headquarters and the recent sacking of an
Andersen partner, it looks like the story&#39;s still got a way to play
out.  You can keep up with all the latest including Al Massey&#39;s
ongoing articles and interviews at Eyeforenergy.
<p>
We&#39;ve got a packed briefing for you this week.  After focusing the
last few editions on the developments surrounding deregulation and energy
trading in both the US and Europe, we&#39;re taking a closer look at two
other issues of interest to the energy community-emissions and weather. 
Two of the articles below focus on the growing market in emissions
trading-the first a look at the market, how it&#39;s developing, where the
money&#39;s to be made, and the second article takes a closer look at the
regulations governing the market.  We&#39;ve also got an article on the
latest developments in weather trading which seems to be a growing part of
many energy traders portfolios and is increasingly popping up on Risk
Managers&#39; radar screens.
<p>
All these articles serve as an excellent segue into a few announcements
here at Eyeforenergy.  Just a quick reminder about the upcoming European
Energy, Weather and Emissions Trading conferences in mid-February. 
We&#39;re quickly running out of hotel space, so if you&#39;re planning on
registering make sure to do it soon before space runs out.  Also,
we&#39;re issuing a call for papers for our upcoming Emissions Trading
show in the US... if you&#39;d like to get involved drop our conference

earth&#39;s climate is predicted to change because human activities are

    In article just released, Mr Hodgson says New Zealand produces less
than 0.2 per cent of world emissions but emissions per person are the
fourth highest in the developed world, including large methane emissions
from farming.

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Mar. 14
Beginning today through 3/19, the Corporate Security team will replace the GRC.dat file in W:\scripts\UpdateGRC and W:\scripts\logon\Win2000\original to point NAV clients on nahou-apnav01 to nahou-apnav02 (only about 650 left).  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
>From 11:00 - 11:15 a.m., the Corporate Security group will remove the svceu_SAPConnect account from CORP Domain Admins group.  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
>From 4:00 - 6:00 p.m.., the Unix Team will upgrade the Time server.  Timex.ect.enron.com which is now on a Unix desktop network will be moved to a production network and to Netra T1 hardware. It would be doing the same activity as Rolex which was replaced on Monday. All clients are now pointing to new Rolex server & Timex.  No impact is expected.  

Mar. 15
>From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will replace the switch on the Extranet link HOPIX1.  This change will cause intermittent outages for those external companies using this link to access the Enron Network.

Mar. 15
>From 8:00 p.m. through 3/17 at 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 15
>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Corporate Server team will place Nahou-appr1 into the Corp Domain.  This change will affect applications using the R drive. 
Mar. 16
>From 10:00 - 11:00 p.m., Telephony Services will perform the monthly maintenance on the CMS (Call management) systems.  This maintenance affects only call center reporting.  No impact to users is expected.
Mar. 16
>From 2:00 - 4:00 p.m., the Blackberry Network Team will perform maintenance on a component of the Blackberry Network.  Some customers may experience delays in receiving messages.  It is also possible that messages sent from he Blackberry may be returned.  Returned messages can be resent after the maintenance is complete.
Mar. 18
>From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will change the DHCP scopes to update the secondary WINS and DNS entries.  This change will affect workstations that get their IP addresses via DHCP.  All scopes are renewed on a 24-hour basis so all changes should be completed by 3/19.  No impact is expected.
May 1
At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.

While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.  

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.    

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has
changed, please notify us by return email.  A profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to Alliance at 713 328-5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile.

We at Alliance are proud of our 17 year association with Enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs.  We have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on Enron's account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come.  
If you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned, or wish to
discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies, please
call me 713 328-5139, or email lhinson@allianceworldwide.com

Welcome to this week's Eyeforenergy Update.  Just to refresh your memories,
this update is sent to you, alternating each week with the main Eyeforenergy
Briefing to let you know of any developments on the Eyeforenergy.com
website, including publication of new stories, whitepapers and special
features, as well as the latest news on our upcoming conferences.

If you visit our homepage www.eyeforenergy.com, you will see that our newest
Featured Content is a special report, commissioned by Norsk Hydro ASA and
produced by the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research
- Oslo.  This takes a look at the current status of climate negotiations and
the Kyoto agreement, particularly after COP7 towards the end of last year.
It's most interesting aspect for Eyeforenergy readers is how it takes a look
at implications for business in terms of compliance, mechanisms and funding,
even for countries which have chosen not to ratify Kyoto such as the USA.
Scroll down the page to read the full report...

On the same subject, early discounted registration is now available for our
CO2 Trading: The North American Market conference, 18-20 June in Chicago,
which already has companies such as DuPont, Entergy, TransAlta, Natsource,
Entergy and Cinergy on board.  Look out for the full program for this event,
which will be published on our website tomorrow.  We can also announce that
the number of industries who will be talking about their energy management
strategies for the first time at Strategy Energy Management USA is growing,
including the likes of International Paper, North Star Steel, Nestl? and
more.  Keep an Eye on future Eyeforenergy Updates for more information as it
becomes available.

Lastly, we are now taking early no-obligation applications for our
forthcoming members only Premium Content subscription area, which will
entitle you to a discount off the already very low price.  See down for
further details...

NEW WHITEPAPER

An evaluation of business implications of the Kyoto Protocol

This report was originally commissioned by Norsk Hydro ASA, and it's aim is
to present and analyze the newest developments in the climate negotiations,
particularly the seventh Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention
in Marrakech, Morocco, in October/November 2001, and to provide an
evaluation of what the finalized Kyoto Protocol means for business.

Eyeforenergy thanks and acknowledges the author Dr Asbj?rn Torvanger
(asbjorn.torvanger@cicero.uio.no) and CICERO (Center for International
Climate and Environmental Research - Oslo), on whose website it was
originally presented.

I didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday, so I'll ask you.  Is Gina Taylor's group working on a draft of the Business Plan?  I understood from Tracy in our meeting with Steve last Friday that someone in Gina's group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation.  Do you know if that's happening?

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.

What period does the max rate assumption cover. The comment that troubles me more is that we are fully contracted West thru 2005. That is not true.

RE: PERMIAN BASIN 3rd QUARTER PRODUCTION 2001REPORT

Lippman Consulting, Inc. has just completed the Permian Basin Production 
report that contains historical volumes for the basin through the 3rd quarter 
of 2001.  The report separates the Permian Basin into the following four 
regions: Southeast New Mexico and the Texas districts of 7C, 8 and 8A.  The 
report contains text and graphs depicting various historical statistics for 
each of the four regions as well as for the total basin.  Statistics on the 
number of new wells first delivered, rig activity and the operators that are 
most active in the region are included in the study.  

The cost for the report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the 
report can be purchased on a one time basis for $450.  If you would like 
additional information or to order the report, please feel free to contact me 
by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

Mar. 22
>From 5:00 - 7:00 p.m., the EDI team will migrate the ECNET server from the 172.28.176.249 network.  This migration will cause a total outage for the ECNET server.  Applications accessing this device via IP address will need to be changed to reflect the new IP which is 172.16.2.22.  The EDINET server at 172.28.176.21 will also be migrated the week of Apr. 6.  More information regarding that change will be available next week.

I thought we were using the average rates for resubscription with an adjustment for fuel because the historical rates assumed a 5% over collection.

Attached is the model incorporating the changes.
1)	have implemented 50% undivided interest concept
2)	Cash flow detail is as follows:
a.	85mm in operating cash flow
b.	18mm net from release of ENE receivable/payable
c.	137.5mm equity infusion
d.	(137.5mm) debt repayment
e.	85mm in new debt (to bring debt to target levels)
f.	185mm equity dividend (to bring equity to target levels)
3)	I've used the income detail tab to ratio taxes appropriately
4)	I've made reg amort $6.8mm per Bob.  Regulatory asset remains on books thru 2011.
5)	?
6)	Not including interest expense, proforma ROE is in the 12.5% to 13.5% range.  Rod, debt capital was not invested in a project with returns exceeding cost of debt, therefore ROE dropped with leverage.  Agreed, this is backwards from intuitive result.

Please see comments below:

1) We should probably show TransPecos as an undivided ownership interest as opposed to an investment in JV.  That way, the revenues and costs will be picked up above the line and can be analyzed with the other revenues.  Looks like we are properly picking up the capex from TransPecos in our capex additions already.  
I might be missing something, but I only see two accounting ways to handle TransPecos - equity method investment (as shown), or consolidated with 50% minority interests.  In the former case our debt holdings are understated, and in the latter they're overstated.  My guess is that the JV will be accounted for as shown.  In terms of capex, currently I have TW picking up 50% of the capex (starting equity basis).  Not to be flip, but I'm not sure which accounting method would let us pick up half the revenues and half the costs.  If we had an undivided interest we would have 50% of the deal on our books, debt and all.

Please let me know which method I should use. 


2) The equity balance did not seem to change for the $137,500,000 equity infusion.     Was this treated as equity in to repay or just an extinguishment? 
There was $184mm in excess cash that was dividended back out.  The model had to increase borrowings and pay a dividend to get the debt/equity ratio to 50% after the infusion.   It would seem to me that if there was 137,500,000 coming in that it needed to be paid to reduce the corresponding debt, so where did the excess cash come from?
 
3) Let's grow Other Taxes by 1%   Should grow by the same percentage as either revenues or net plant.   For most pipes these are property/earnings dependent and are derived from the uitlity operating income line on the form 2 for the most part.
I need to fix the model to make "other taxes" a function of ppe.  I'll make it a constant rate based on year 1.  Rod reminds me that part of that is probably gross receipts - I'll go back to the  planning models and try to figure out a relative proportion.    Also a part is payroll taxes.    Tracy could probably break it apart for you.

4) Question for TG, Reg Am was only $7.6 million in 2002 but $16.5 million going forward.   All Reg Am should disappear with the new rate case. 
that's why we had to increase it so much - so that it amortizes to zero by 2006.  Note that it is non-cash, non-tax, but it represents a large reduction in equity.    Then there must be a problem elsewhere, since it is supposed to be gone by itself.

5) Question for LD/SH on the 2006 drop in revenues by approx. $15 million.  Detail schedules show why, just want to make sure it makes sense.
That's an item that Lindy's following up on, but probably the whole group needs to consider.  Our fuel retention goes away after '06, the question is whether "max rates" should add in the revenues that we derived from fuel retention or not.  The interpretation in the model is that "max rates" means our max published reservation fee only, meaning that we lose $15mm of fuel retention after '06.    If we are at max rates, then that would be the result, however if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back up to the max rate number.

6) ROE questions/cases -

	Let's show after ROE, the ROE without the effect of the additional debt that was added in Nov. 2001.  This obviously dropped the ROE from 12-13% to 10%.  If Cooper is successfully in coming out with no debt on TW (it should not have been there in the first place!), the ROE will be much higher.  In addition, reducing equity by the $137,500,000 should also improve the ROE substantially.    ?
I'll run a line that adds back tax-adjusted interest expense in the ROE calc, the $137.5mm was handled as above.   This is not intuitive.   The ROE should be bigger with debt, unless the ROE is less than the cost of debt.     Debt up, equity down, ROE up?

As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

Are you going to be working a regular 5x8 schedule?

Did my voicemail address your question from yesterday?

Thanks,

Please plan to attend a meeting regarding TW's Order 637 filing immediately following Steve's staff meeting on Monday, March 24.  We will remain in 39C1 following Steve's meeting to discuss the strategy for resolving TW's Order 637 issues.  FERC Chairman Pat Wood has pledged to get all 637 orders issued by this August so we need to consider what we need to do to eliminate those proposals we no longer want and, hopefully, trade them for deferring segmenting until the next rate case.  Please invite anyone else who could benifit from or contribute to this meeting.

I think it makes sense to get together either later today or tomorrow morning to go over the forecast.  Given that Tracy is out, I don't want anything to slip through the cracks.  Except for a 3-4 meeting, I am free after that.

Attached is a matrix of Order 637 issues by intervenor/customer indicating which issues they protested.  Along with Teb's outline being prepared, I thought this might be useful as an at-a-glance sheet for each customer especially prior to any informal meetings that may be held before filing revisions to our original proposal.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.  gh

Hello Lindy Lou! How are you doing? Are you holding up? I was so glad to talk with you about how things were affecting you. You amaze me in how you are so objective and practical about the whole thing. Your concern is not for yourself but others who are older have less time before retirement. You are so thoughtful. But I have known that. I was sorry you felt so bad about the Company. You have worked for a great company that has been successful and good for the country let alone the oil market economy. This mismanagement is not a reflection on all the very very hard working honorable people who made the company what it is today. Like you and 99.9999% of the people involved. I just wanted to tell you I love you and was thinking about you today. I took Claire to get tested for allergies today. What a sad thing they poked her 18 times. She is allergic to cats and has a propensity to be allergic to the hampsters we have so the doc limited her contact with them. The cat allergy is!
 a problem because our sitter who watches her 3-4 afternoons a week has a cat. This lady-Carol is a Godsend. I think Claire's own grandparents couldn't care for her as good as this lady. She is like a member of the family. So, I don't know what we'll do about the allergy situation. You know how hard it is to find someone you trust to care for your child. I told Claire we could go anywhere for lunch since she was crying with the "multiple Pokes" to her skin and then I got paged to Adam's school that he had a fever and wanted to come home. So, I am in the Mommie mode today. Somedays I think it would be good to be home all the time. But, we'd have to move. Well, I'm just rambling on-imagine that! I hope you have a good day! Write back and let me know how Sam, Tony, Missy, Andrew, Anthony and of course YOU are! 
L/Y/L/A/S Holly Louise

FERC Approves North Baja Pipe 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. 
The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. 
FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. 
If the project "is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action," the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
The pipeline could be delivering gas to the first of two new power plants in Mexicali as early as mid-summer. Work has been underway for some time on the longer, Mexican portion of the line which runs from Yuma, AZ, near the Mexican border to the Rosarito Beach area south of Tijuana in the northwest corner of Baja.

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Jan 28	
Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Telephony team will remove the telephone switch from 3AC and migrate phone numbers.  The maintenance is expected to last approximately one hour.  Each block of numbers will experience an outage of a few minutes during which calls made to an affected number will not go through and will not roll to voice mail.  The numbers affected are: 345-5000...6999; 713-646-6000...6599; 713-646-7000...7999; 713-646-8200...8399; 713-646-8600..8699; 713-646-9700...9799; 713-345-0200...2999.  The number 713-345-7000 to access voice mail will not be affected by this maintenance.  However, any number within these maintenance groups will be affected regardless of whether it was moved from 3AC.  This change will impact ETS users.

The question below was forwarded to me by Aquila.  The question (in red) is from PPL.  What would be TW's strategy and can someone get back with PPL?

thanks

Kevin, thanks for the document we will have it reviewed in the event PPL
opts to 
use it to meet any credit requirements.

I do have one question that might have been addressed at the informational 
sessions.  Based on the open season documents, Red Lake will interconnect
with 
both El Paso and TW at a minimum, with other points to be determined based
on 
interest. I was wondering if there had been any discussions with either
pipeline 
about the impact of adding this interconnection. I know that may be a loaded

questions, but based on historic flows, in order to guarantee firm
deliveries 
from that receipt point, a shipper would have to move its primary receipt
point 
to the Red Lake interconnection (from say San Juan or East of Thoreau areas
on 
TW) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines. Sorry for the 
rambling question, but in valuating the asset, the question of
transportation 
inevitably comes up. 

Thanks
David

I have not received any responses regarding the January file.  Therefore, I am assuming no news is good news.

Jeanette - Please prepare for final filing to the FERC.  If you need any assistance, please let me know.

TK - Please review/verify the rates that I have highlighted in pink.

I have already spoken with Terry regarding 3 days where I noticed discrepancies between total scheduled in TMS vs website posting and have determined the correct number to report.  All other data looks very similar to previous reports filed.

Please provide any comments or updates that may be necessary by COB February 22nd.

Today, Friday, March 22, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message. Please note that the retention and severance plan mentioned in the transcript is for the debtor companies of Enron.

Steve Cooper
Voicemail Message
Distributed Friday, March 22, 2002

Hi everybody, it's Steve Cooper.  It's Thursday evening, March 21.  I'm sorry I haven't gotten to you earlier this week, but we've been finalizing and dotting the I's and crossing the T's on the retention and severance plan.  It's that I want to update you on.

We've continued to present and represent the plan to the Creditors' Committee, and now they are comfortable with it and in support of it, which is all good news.  In order to be able to motion this up to the court, we are in the process of finalizing all the various documentation necessary -- the plan itself, the motions, the applications so on and so forth.  I am relatively confident that we will have this motioned up next week sometime.  This has gotten pushed back a number of times, but I think we now have it on track and hopefully next week will be the week.

I do apologize for the way this thing has gotten delayed.  Now that I have worked with a number of you over the last month or two, I see how quickly you move and how quickly you are used to moving - so, I've got to believe that this has been incredibility frustrating for all of you.  Once we get this motioned up, there is a notice and objection period before the court order is approved and the plan goes active.  I can't guarantee you that it's going to go active.  But, I'm pretty confident - in fact, I'm highly confident - that with the endorsement of the Creditors' Committee, the court will approve it.

However, we are not going to wait until we get approval to share the details of the plan with you.  We will put a process in place so that over the next week or so we will hold one-on-one meetings with all of you to discuss the individual participation and what these plans are going to mean to each and every one of you to eliminate to the greatest extent possible the uncertainty that everyone has been living with over the last several months.

The plan is retroactive to March 1, regardless of when the court approves it, so I want everybody to know that will be the start date.

On another subject, the merit increases and promotions for employees in the debtor companies have been finalized and communicated, with the possible exception of some MD's and VP's.  Hopefully, you have all been notified about those promotions.

On the merit increase side, I believe they have all been finalized for all employees below the vice president level.  Hopefully, by now you have received information as to what those increases are.  If you haven't, I would encourage you to speak to whoever you report to.

Everything else is moving forward.  I think we now have the employees meeting scheduled for April 11, and I'm looking forward to seeing and meeting more of you at that get together.  We are on target for pulling together a longer-term business plan for the company, and hopefully will be able to describe it to you in some detail on April 11.  

We're exchanging information and communicating with the creditors on a more regular and steady basis.  Those relationships are beginning to settle down.  I think there is actually a lot of good news that I can impart to you over the next several weeks.

I want to thank everybody for your continued efforts and understanding.  Again, I want to apologize for the way this thing has dragged, but I can assure you that Jeff McMahon, the Human Resource people, and myself have all been working like busy bees to get this program finalized and in place.  Knock on wood next week is the week.

Everybody have a great evening.  If you have any concerns, issues, or problems, please don't hesitate to give me a buzz or an Email and I will get back to each and every one of you as soon as I can.  Have a great night and thanks again for all your support, help and dedication to the ongoing Enron organization.

Thanks!  Should I call an estimate or is this actual?  Also, any changes on the slide I sent yesterday?

Jan,
	I had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together, but I wasn't sure if it was the final, actuals for 2001.  What was TW's total actual throughput for 2001?

James:
Can you roll each of the expansions that we discussed into Rod's project model? Michael Ratner will then link those into the TW financial model.

Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an "average rate" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-
Davis

What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

Lindy, Tony and Sam:

Thank you very much for the fun visit this past weekend.  Of course the
highlight of our trip was being with Sam.  I don't have to tell you we
really miss that bright, shining face!  It's amazing how quickly you
become attached.  When we woke up Tuesday morning we both said how much
we already missed being able to be with him.  He spoiled us quickly.  I
told Lisa and John they should go and visit to enjoy his adorable
personality and fun age.  

Our trip home was not what we expected, but it could have been worse.
Going through Chicago seemed a round about way to get to Omaha from
Houston, but it worked out fine and we arrived here only about 2 hours
later than the original schedule.  Flying can definitely be an
adventure.

I not only miss Sam, but I miss your warm weather too!  It is cold and
dreary today and the weatherman said we will probably have snow tonight
and tomorrow.  I shouldn't complain--this winter has been wonderful.
But at the same time I truly enjoyed not having to wear a coat.  

I know you are looking forward to having the next two days off from work
(plus the weekend).  

Thanks again for the nice visit.  We really had a good time.  Give Sam
hugs and kisses from us.  We miss all of you!

Love you.

Flo and Papa Flo

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 2/1/2002 forward. 

A couple of things to note:
PG&E released two separate packages of gas for 25,000/day from Bloomfield to CA [one was at a fixed rate and the other is index based].
Socal indicated that the core customers they provided capacity via capacity release protested a ruling by the CPUC and won; therefore, these monthly prearranged releases are back on for now.  Because the decision came in late, Socal was not able to release for the full month of February.
ENA's capacity on K #24924 was again successfully released for February with TW collecting marketing revenues.

If you have any questions, please let me know.



 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

We have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations, bankruptcy related issues, managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues.  While I have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges, we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful.

In light of the above, I have asked Danny McCarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for Enron Global Services (EGS).  Danny's responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities, the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses.

Until the question of our right to repurchase Northern Natural Gas is resolved, it is better to minimize organizational changes.  Consequently, I do not plan to replace Danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) at this time.  Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Rob Kilmer, Shelley Corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me.

I truly appreciate Danny's willingness to take on this responsibility.  His involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues, while allowing Jim Hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day-to-day operations.

As always, thank you for your continued dedication and support.

Stan

Gov. Davis announced today his appointment of Mike Peevey as Commissioner at the CPUC to replace Com. Bilas who resigned last week.  Mr. Peevey is the former President of Southern California Edison and as such advocated deregulation.  Consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state Senate approval.  Below is an article from the Sacramento Bee.  gh


Davis names ex-Edison chief to PUC
But the action stirs anger: 'Our worst nightmare,' says a consumer lawyer.
By Stuart Leavenworth -- Bee Staff Writer
Published 5:30 a.m. PST Wednesday, March 6, 2002
Gov. Gray Davis has appointed a former president of Southern California Edison to a state panel charged with regulating Edison and other public utilities.
Davis said Michael R. Peevey would bring "more than three decades of experience" to the Public Utilities Commission -- experience that immediately came under fire from the state's consumer groups.
Mike Florio, a lawyer for The Utility Reform Network, said Peevey has a record, both in government and in business, of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers.
"This is a our worst nightmare," Florio said. "It is like putting Dr. Kevorkian in charge of a nursing home."
Others were more supportive. D.J. Smith, a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users, lauded Peevey as someone "who understands all sides of the energy business" and will be fair to all sides.
"I think he will be objective about Edison because he doesn't owe Edison anything," said Smith, noting that Peevey left the Southern California utility nine years ago.
The husband of Assemblywoman Carol Liu, D-South Pasadena, Peevey replaces PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, who resigned last week. Bilas was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson.
If confirmed by the state Senate, Peevey will solidify Davis' control over the PUC, a five-member board that now includes three of the governor's appointees. It also comes at a time when the commission is fighting with the state's other large utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., on terms for PG&E's reorganization in federal bankruptcy court.
PG&E spokesman Ron Low declined to comment on the appointment Tuesday, but last year Peevey was involved with a handshake deal that might have helped PG&E avoid bankruptcy.
Hired by Davis to negotiate with the utility, Peevey reportedly struck a deal with PG&E Chairman Bob Glynn that would have let PG&E charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity. But other Davis advisers objected to the deal and the negotiations ultimately fell apart.
For three years, Peevey was president of Edison International and Southern California Edison before leaving in 1993 in a reported power struggle with company Chairman John Bryson.
Peevey then became a public affairs consultant and then president of NewEnergy Inc., an energy service provider that was sold in 1999 to AES Corp. After working as an adviser to Davis, he had been CEO of TruePricing Inc. and also has served on the board of Excelergy Corp., an energy software company.
With his new six-year PUC job, Peevey will regulate not only electric utilities but telecommunications giants, water companies, natural gas supplies and other industries.
After a review by PUC lawyers, Peevey will have to divest holdings and resign from positions that could cause a conflict, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.
Peevy's appointment was one of two Davis made Tuesday. He also appointed John L. Geesman to the board of the Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid.
Since 1985, Geesman has been the managing director of fixed income banking for RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. in San Francisco. He once served on TURN's board.
Consumer groups, which had pressed for a meeting with Davis for the past week, said the he may have timed his Election Day appointment of Peevey to minimize negative media coverage.
Maviglio called that claim "ludicrous." Today's papers, he said, "will be some of the best read this year."

we need a guess now.  Stan wants a first pass by tomorrow afternoon - we should be able to ballpark this number.

Facilty Planning personnel are out of office today, but will return in the morning.  I have ask for their estimate no later than Monday morning.  They may be able to give me something tommorrow.  I will complete the project model when I get a description of facilities and cost estimates.

James:
Can you roll each of the expansions that we discussed into Rod's project model? Michael Ratner will then link those into the TW financial model.

Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an "average rate" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.
Kevin

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-

Lindy,

While testing the new CMS TW contract system, we have come across situations with the firm contracts & PNR points. We need to know how marketing sets up the PNR points on firm contracts. 

Do you want all valid PNR points within the path, to be added as alternate receipt & delivery points  on every firm contract or do you add the PNR points only on request form the customer? Looking at most of the Firm contracts in production today, I do not see many PNR points attached as alternate points.

Please let us know how we should handle PNR points for firm contracts?

Thanks Ramona

T.K., Lindy,

I have set up new groups for TW in the PLE system that emulate the templets in CBS.  I would like to get together with you and review the lists or give you a copy and have you review them.  Do you have some time this afternoon for me to come down with the lists?  Let me know.

Thanks

As many of you know, yesterday we closed on Dynegy's option to acquire Northern Natural.  Shortly, a more comprehensive message will be distributed about that transaction and what it means for all of us.  

One important requirement under that transaction is that Enron Operations Services Company has agreed to continue providing certain services to Northern consistent with our past operations.  Northern will be billed for those services, and we will be required to demonstrate the basis for those billings.  

Effective, Feb. 1, all employees in the ETS family of companies that perform any services for Northern or related to Northern's operations in any way should keep timesheets documenting the amount of time spent on Northern projects or supporting personnel and activities related to Northern projects.  

If there are any questions about this requirement, please communicate with your department head or with me.  Thanks for your help in implementing this important requirement.  

Jim

Ramona,
Yes, K 24954 is a Hub contract and we have special code tied to it. Let me know if you find any evidence showing otherwise.

Wayne,

Do you have this contract defined as a HUB contract? I thought that we showed this as a FTS-1 HUB agreement. Please let me know. Also don't you have  specific hard coding tied to the HUB contracts?

Thanks Ramona

Should Cr 24954 (The Northwest Capacity in the Hub) be and FTS-1 contract or should it be an Administrative contract?

It is currently set up as an FTS-1.

As some of you know, I am working on a project for Tracy regarding the actual amount of fuel on TW that would be available to sell on any given day and coming up with a more accurate valuation for the gas.  I have attached a Daily Balance Report that Rich sent me for discussion purposes.  Please let me know if you are available to have a meeting on this on Friday, March 8, at 10:30 am.  If the time works for people I will locate a room and let you know.

Thanks,

Michael

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

Subject:	RE: Draft - SoCal/Topock Announcement

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Subject:	Draft - SoCal/Topock Announcement

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

I heard Kevin talking to Tracey and she asked could they just circle back with him next week.  Kevin said yes that he could be brought up to speed later, so I guess he doesn't have to call in afterall.

I didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday, so I'll ask you.  Is Gina Taylor's group working on a draft of the Business Plan?  I understood from Tracy in our meeting with Steve last Friday that someone in Gina's group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation.  Do you know if that's happening?

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Hi Lindy!  Laura McGuire and I were talking about you today.  Remember we
were working on Florabama and we met her for lunch and it was pouring down
rain?!  She was in my office today for a meeting and it took us a while to
remember how we knew each other.  She got married in January; I think her
new last name is Heckman.

Anyway, I was thinking about you and I hope you're doing well thru all this
Enron mess.  How is Sam?  talking up a storm already?

Take care--

Susan

Please be advised that we successfully converted existing data and implemented the new contract/capacity release system for Transwestern last week.  With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.  

Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

NEW REMAINING RESERVE REPORT

Lippman Consulting, Inc. is proud to announce that is has just completed a 
new Lower 48 States Dry Remaining Reserve Report. This report lists annually 
the reserves, additions, revisions and production as well as the reserve life 
index for the period 1990 through 2000. The data for this report was obtained 
from the EIA and is shown in both a table and graphical form. LCI has 
captured the data and summarized the report into the 8 separate producing 
regions that we have used for all our other production reports. Individual 
charts and tables are provided for each of the separate regions. The report 
quickly gives the reader an excellent overview of the historical activities 
that have been underway in each of the regions. It highlights the growth of 
some regions and the significant declines in other regions. Historical 
reserve life index over the period for each region is provided to inform the 
reader of the producing ability of that region.  

The cost for the report is $300.  If you would like additional information or 
to order the report, please feel free to contact me by e-mail at 
Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

Kevin:

Dave will wordsmith his California write-up and send the document to us.
Is the attached for IX. Summary Financial Data?
New Source Review: When we put in new engine, we have to go through New Source Review permitting process.  To get a permit, generally we have to install emission control equipment.  Some state agencies are now saying that when we do major maintenance on our existing engine, we have to go through the same process as installing a new engine.

Lindy, I believe you have the rest of Kevin's questions.

I have attached below the 5-year projection template required from Corporate.  I am working with Jim's group on the actuals.  We need to check classification between actuals and forecast to make sure we are consistent.  I am not sure we will have actuals before I leave today.  I need someone to help me out here if we need to make a change.  These numbers are straight from Davis' latest model.




   

Someone also needs to forward to Corp.  I think we are supposed to have all of this in today.

Subject:	SoCalGas/SDG&E BCAPs -- ALJ Brown Denies EGA Motion to Strike


ALJ Brown denied the EGA motion to strike, so testimony on both the  embedded cost-based and the long-run marginal cost-based (LRMC) methodologies  for revenue allocation among customer classes will be allowed in this  proceeding.   Attached is a copy of  her ruling.  Her primary rationale is expressed on page 6, as  follows:
".....the Commission has frequently  deviated from cost allocations based solely on LRMC, and has been moving  towards embedded costs for unbundled transmission and storage functions, as  evidenced in both the recent decision in the GIR, and in the Gas Accord for  PG&E.  Therefore, it is  apparent that the Commission is interested in comparing LRMC and embedded cost  for cost allocation purposes.  For  this reason, EGA's motion to strike testimony on embedded cost-based  allocation is denied.  Testimony  on embedded costs will be compared with the testimony on LRMC, to enable  parties and the Commission to determine which method, or combination of  methods, is most appropriate for allocation among customers of each utilities'  non-gas costs of service.   Including an embedded cost analysis in this BCAP might require more  work from all the parties, but the record will then be as complete as possible  so that the Commission can make a well-informed  decision."
She also ruled that, "The  evidentiary hearing schedule of May 21 through June 14, 2002, is not suspended  at this time.  No later than January  22, 2002, parties are to meet and confer to determine if a shift in the filing  dates for testimony will be sufficient to meet the needs of the parties' to  respond to the March amendments to Biennial Cost Allocation Proceeding  applications, and keep the established hearing schedule."

On January 29, 2002, Enron named Stephen F. Cooper interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. To keep employees informed about developments, Mr. Cooper left voicemail messages to employees on January 29 and February 8.   Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcripts of those messages.

Hi everybody.  This is Steve Cooper.  It's about 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock Houston time, Friday afternoon.  It's been a pretty hectic week, but I'd like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with what's gone on this last week.

Beginning last weekend, the Board's special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report - in fact it's about 200 odd pages, and it's fairly pointed and blunt.  The report was troubling, and as I'm sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week, its findings have further dented our corporate history.  Nonetheless, I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job I'm paid to do, and hopefully, the job all of you are getting paid to do, is to look forward and proceed that way at 100 percent full speed.  I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to.

The committee and the report didn't offer any specific recommendations.  Rather, it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years.  Enron's board, management and Creditors' Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports' findings and take whatever action is required.  I, like many of you, am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company, we're going to have to have a management team in place that is credible, that's committed to moving forward for the future, that is trusted by our outside constituents, and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work.  Next week, after the Board meeting, I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company.

The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing.  And obviously, this has been translated into the daily headlines.  Hopefully, these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding Enron.  And with this, I'm sure we'll be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward - not only for Enron - but for other corporations.  This situation, I believe, will have a national impact.

It's going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business - in fact it already has.
It's going to bring in new and more effective reporting rules.
It's going to put more teeth into the SEC,.
ARISA is going to be modified.
There's not a doubt in my mind that Congress or these Committees are eventually going to look at Wall Street and the commercial banks and put them in their sites.

During the last week I've spent almost all my time dealing with the company's Creditors' Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking, concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda, a free flow of information, a free flow of communications, and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize Enron.  As I continue to look at our various businesses, I'm as optimistic as I was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us, if everybody is reasonable and responsible, and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganized.

In any event, I'll continue to keep you updated as we move forward.  In the meantime, if you have any specific questions or comments about Enron or its restructuring or anything else that's on your mind, don't hesitate to either send me an e-mail or give me a buzz and I will do the best I can to respond as quickly as possible.  If my response isn't satisfactory the first time around - just buzz me again.

Listen everyone, have a wonderful weekend and I hope to see you next week in Houston.  Bye-bye.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Tuesday, January 29, 2002

Good morning everyone, this is Steve Cooper ? it's the morning of January 29th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enron's interim CEO.  My firm, Zolfo Cooper, my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process.  I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward.

I can't imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you.  I'm sure it's been incredibly difficult, particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched.  In that environment, I've got to believe it's difficult, if not impossible, for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization.

I'm not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning, however, I'd like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this.

It's been the experience of myself, my firm, my partners, that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy, we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings.  Those metrics are typically the organization, the asset base that the company has to bring to bear, customer base, and liquidity.  From what I've been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here, Enron has a very, very bright, very capable, very committed, hardworking and dedicated organization.  All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize, restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy.

Number 2, the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here.  The regulated assets, the pipelines, the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around.

Third, loyal customers.  Most of Enron's customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis.

And fourth, liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand, the cash it expects to generate in the near term, and with the backstop of the DIP financing, it doesn't appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward.

With those four resources nicely in place, I'm very confident that we can successfully restructure this company.  I don't want to leave the impression that it will be easy.  It's going to be an enormous amount of work.  There will be upsets, issues, and concerns along the way.  But I can tell you that I've seen companies in bankruptcy that don't have nearly as strong a position as this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy, and I'm certain Enron will also.

I'm looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and I'm very pleased to be here.  Jeff, Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward.  If there are any thoughts, concerns, issues that you would like to bring to my attention, please don't hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call.

Thanks so much, and I look forward to working with all of you.

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Feb 27
>From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will block all ICMP messages from all Internet routers.  These changes will be made on the Houston, Ardmore EIN, and Omaha Internet routers.  No impact is expected.

Feb. 27
>From 9:00 - 10:00 p.m., the Messaging team will upgrade Nahou-MSBES01P, Nahou-MSBES02P and Nahou-MSBES03P to SP2 and apply a hotfix.  This change will result in a five minute delay sending and receiving Blackberry messages.

>From 7:00 p.m. through 3/1 at 1:00 a.m., the Unix team will upgrade the ftp.enron.com server from existing Ultar2 to E450 as well as upgrade ftp to Proftp ver. 1.2. This maintenance will result in a total outage of the ftp.enron.com site.  The old sites moby.enron.com and sparky.enron.com will no longer exist after this change.  Support staff should ensure jobs going to the enron ftp server use ftp.enron.com.  Any questions about this maintenance, contact me at 713-853-3381 or 713-859-6676.

Mar. 6
At 12:00 p.m., the Gas Measurement team will decommission the MIPS server (IP address 192.168.175.62).  All users and processing should be pointing to PGAS as the MIPS system is not longer being updated. The MIPS server will be powered off at this time but the equipment will not be moved until later.

At the meeting yesterday, SoCalGas outlined their plan for implementing the unbundling of their backbone system including a proposed timeline which will be filed at the CPUC on Jan. 17, 2002.  Lad Lorenz state that the proposal is "not cast in concrete" and invited comments at the meeting as well as in response to the filing.  However as you might expect, when some customers expressed their concern with the timeline being too short, SoCal made no offer to push some of the dates out into the future and stuck with their proposal.  All of the proposed dates are their best estimate for timing as variables such as the system requirements may cause delays and rescheduling of some portions of the implementation plan.  Key items and dates are as follows:

Jan. 17		SoCalGas files its proposed Implementation Plan and timeline.

Feb. 14		Meeting with CPUC Energy Staff and Interested Parties.  Tariff Workshop.

Feb. 22		SoCalGas files tariffs including a definition of Annual Average Usage for existing end-use customers.
		This definition is important as it determines their capacity rights in the Open Season.	

Mar. 15		50 mmcf/d of capacity at North Needles to be placed into service.

May 6		Distribution of informational packages on Backbone Receipt Point Rights to customers.

May 29		Begin Phase I of the Open Season.

June 5		Phase I Open Season ends.  See Slides 55 through 57 for all other Open Season dates.

June 22		SoCal will post awarded receipt point capacity.

July 1		Implementation of unbundling the backbone receipt point services.

Slide 13		Indicates North Needles has 800 mmcf/d of capacity
		This was described as "primarily Transwestern"

Slide 15		The Core backbone receipt point capacity at Needles is set at 313 mmcf/d.

I'm faxing an entire copy of the presentation to Marketing and Regulatory Affairs for distribution and review.  Slides 11-21 describe the Backbone Receipt Services and Slides 50-63 provide the proposed timeline for implementation.  Please give me a call if you have any questions about SoCal's proposal.  gh

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Mar. 21
>From 5:00 - 7:30 p.m., the Corporate Unix team will perform maintenance on dns1-corp.  Dns1-corp is the primary dns server for enron.com domain.  Queries to enron.com domain will be forwarded to dns2-corp which is the secondary dns server.  No impact is expected.
Mar. 21
>From 7:00 - 8:00 p.m., the Messaging team will update the virus engine on Mailsweeper servers. This will be done on a monthly basis for better protection against new viruses.  No impact is expected.
Mar. 21
>From 8:00 - 11:45 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 23
>From 5:00 p.m. through 3/24 at 7:00 a.m., the Envision system will be taken offline to perform backups.  Users will not be able to access information located on Envision during this maintenance.
Mar. 25
>From 9:00 a.m. through 4/5 at 3:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will make WINS/DNS changes on all servers to reflect the new server settings.  Devices that require a reboot will be submitted via a separate change control.   Some impact may occur during these changes and that information will be forwarded as it becomes available.
May 1
At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.  
Future Changes:
ENS backbone will be upgrading the code on the floor switches in the very near future.  Individual companies will be contacted as the floors are scheduled.  This will result in network outages for ETS and will be coordinated with ENS.

Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an "average rate" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-
Davis

All,

When I set the date for the dinner at our house, I forgot that it was around "Spring Break".  So, not wanting to cause any conflict in schedule and wanting to help promote family time, I decided to CANCEL the dinner for March 16 and RESCHEDULE for another time.  Sarah and I look forward to having everyone over so we'll put our heads together and come up with a better date.

Hope this hasn't caused any inconvenience,

Mark

 Allegheny Energy Supply Company, Salt River  Project and Sempra Energy Res=
ources Announce Open Season for Proposed  Desert Crossing Gas Storage and T=
ransportation System   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]    PHOENIX, Jan. =
10 /PRNewswire/ -- The Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation Syste=
m (Desert Crossing) is holding an Open Season for customers interested in c=
apacity, beginning today and extending through Feb. 8, 2002.     Open Seaso=
n is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas stora=
ge capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeli=
ne, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purcha=
se the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing sy=
stem will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas =
storage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, no=
rth of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 mil=
es from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an=
 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage comple=
x with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and sou=
thern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com =
).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and=
 trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Proj=
ect (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE =
), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-respons=
ive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwest=
ern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on na=
tural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along =
with past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region,=
 have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline pro=
ject attractive.     "As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeli=
ne configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consum=
ers' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation cap=
acity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets," commented Michael Morrel=
l, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. "The increased storage and t=
ransportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective pr=
ices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas."      S=
RP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David =
Areghini, concurred.  "As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by addi=
ng new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability=
 to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossi=
ng project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consu=
mers and others in the Southwest for many years."     "The additional natur=
al gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, e=
specially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to=
 help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest," said Dwain Boettcher, v=
ice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. "The ho=
urly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to =
transform the way storage service is offered in the future."     Customers =
participating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedent=
ed flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse ga=
s supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize thei=
r portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's e=
nergy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary reg=
ulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the =
Open Season. Project scope and costs will be announced at the conclusion of=
 the Open Season. To participate in the Open Season and for more informatio=

___
This is the story of the night my ten-year-old cat, Rudy, got his head
stuck in the garbage disposal. I knew at the time that the experience
would
be funny if the cat survived, so let me tell you right up front that the
cat is
fine. 
   
Getting him out wasn't easy, though, and the process included numerous
home remedies, a plumber, two cops, an emergency overnight veterinary
clinic, a case of mistaken identity, five hours of panic, and fifteen
minutes of fame. 
   
My husband Rich and I had just returned from a 5 day vacation in the
Cayman Islands--where I had been sick as a dog the whole time. We
arrived
home at 9 p.m., a day and a half later than we had planned because of
airline problems. I still had illness-related vertigo, and because of
the
flight delays, had not been able to prepare for the class I was supposed
to
teach at 8:40 the next morning. I sat down at my desk to think about
William
Carlos Williams, and around ten o'clock I heard Rich hollering from the
kitchen. 
   
I raced over to see what was wrong and spied Rich frantically rooting
around under the kitchen sink and Rudy--or, rather, Rudy's headless
body--scrambling around in the sink, his claws clicking in panic on the
metal and his head stuck in the garbage disposal. Rich had just ground
up
the skin of some smoked salmon in the disposal, and when he left the
room,
Rudy (who always was a pinhead) had gone in after it. 
   
It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink.
This is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years, who
burrows
under the covers and purrs against my side, and who now looked like a
fur-covered turkey carcass, defrosting in the sink while it's still
alive
and kicking.   It was also disturbing to see Rich, Mr.
Calm-in-any-Emergency, at his wit's end, trying to simultaneously soothe
Rudy and undo the garbage disposal, and failing at both, and basically
freaking out. 
   
Adding to the chaos was Rudy's twin brother Lowell, also upset, racing
around in circles, jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately
licking
Rudy's butt for comfort and biting it out of fear. Clearly, I had to do
something. 
   
First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by lubricating his head
and neck with Johnson's baby shampoo (kept on hand for my nieces'
visits)
and butter-flavored Crisco. Both failed, and a now-greasy Rudy kept
struggling. Rich then decided to take apart the garbage disposal, which
was
a good idea, but he couldn't do it. Turns out, the thing is constructed
like
a metal onion: you peel off one layer and another one appears, with
Rudy's
head still buried deep inside, stuck in a hard plastic collar. 
   
My job during this process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting
Rudy,
trying to calm him, with the room spinning (vertigo), Lowell howling
(he's
part Siamese), and Rich clattering around under the sink with his tools.

   
When all our efforts failed, we sought professional help. I called our
regular plumber, who actually called me back quickly, even at 11 o'clock
at
night (thanks, Dave). He talked Rich through further layers of disposal
dismantling, but still we couldn't reach Rudy. 
   
I called the 1-800 number for Insinkerator (no response), a pest removal
service that advertises 24-hour service (no response), an all-night
emergency veterinary clinic (who had no experience in this matter), and
finally, in desperation, 9-1-1. I could see that Rudy's normally pink
paw
pads were turning blue. The fire department, I figured, gets cats out of
trees; maybe they could get one out of a garbage disposal. 
   
The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two policemen.
The
cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice.  More
importantly, they were also able to think rationally, which we were not.
They were, of course, astonished by the situation. 
   
"I've never seen anything like this," Officer Mike kept saying. (The 
unusual circumstances helped us get quickly on a first- name basis with
our
cops.)   Officer Tom, who expressed immediate sympathy for our plight
("I've
had cats all my life," he said), also had an idea. Evidently we needed a
certain tool, a tiny, circular rotating saw, that could cut through the
heavy plastic flange encircling Rudy's neck without hurting Rudy.
Officer
Tom happened to own one. "I live just five minutes from here," he said.
"I'll go get it." 
   
He soon returned, and the three of them--Rich and the two policemen--got
under the sink together to cut through the garbage disposal. I sat on
the
counter, holding Rudy and trying not to succumb to the surreal-ness of
the
scene, with the weird middle-of-the-night lighting, the room's
occasional
spinning, Lowell's spooky sound effects, an apparently headless cat in
my
sink and six disembodied legs poking out from under it. One good thing
came
of this: the guys did manage to get the bottom off the disposal, so we
could
now see Rudy's face and knew he could breathe. But they couldn't cut the
flange without risking the cat. Stumped. 
   
Officer Tom had another idea. "You know," he said, "I think the reason
we
can't get him out is the angle of his head and body. (you can see where
this
is going, can't you?) "If we could just get the sink out," he continued,
"and lay it on its side, I'll bet we could slip him out." 
   
That sounded like a good idea--at this point, ANYTHING would have
sounded
like a good idea--and as it turned out, Officer Mike runs a plumbing
business on weekends; he knew how to take out the sink! Again they went
to
work, the three pairs of legs sticking out from under the sink,
surrounded
by an ever-increasing pile of tools and sink parts. 
   
They cut the electrical supply, capped off the plumbing lines,
unfastened
the metal clamps, unscrewed all the pipes, and about an hour later,
viola!
The sink was lifted gently out of the countertop, with one guy holding
the
garbage disposal which contained Rudy's head) up close to the sink
(which
contained Rudy's body). We laid the sink on its side, but even at this
more
favorable angle, Rudy stayed stuck. 
   
Officer Tom's radio beeped, calling him away on some kind of real police
business. As he was leaving, though, he had another good idea.  "You
know,"
he said, "I don't think we can get him out while he's struggling so
much. We
need to get the cat sedated. If he were limp, we could slide him out." 
   
And off he went, regretfully, a cat lover still worried about Rudy.  The
remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated was a good idea,
but
Rich and I were new to the area. We knew that the overnight emergency
veterinary clinic was only a few minutes away, but we didn't know
exactly
how to get there. "I know where it is!" declared Officer Mike. "Follow
me!"    
So Mike got into his patrol car, Rich got into the driver's seat of our
car, and I got into the back, carrying the kitchen sink, what was left
of
the garbage disposal, and Rudy. It was now about 2:00 a.m. We followed
Officer Mike for a few blocks when I decided to put my hand into the
garbage
disposal to pet Rudy's face, hoping I could comfort him. 
   
Instead, my sweet, gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger really
hard
and wouldn't let go. My scream reflex kicked into gear. Rich slammed on
the
brakes, hollering "What? What happened? Should I stop?" 
   
"No," I managed to get out between screams, "just keep driving. Rudy's
biting me, but we've got to get to the vet. Just go!" Rich turned his
attention back to the road, where Officer Mike took a turn we hadn't
expected, and we followed. After a few minutes Rudy let go, and as I
stopped
screaming, I looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly
through
an industrial park, in and out of empty parking lots, past little
streets
that didn't look at all familiar. 
   
"Where's he taking us?" I asked. "We should have been there ten minutes
ago!" Rich was as mystified as I was, but all we knew to do was follow
the
police car until, finally, he pulled into a church parking lot and we
pulled
up next to him. As Rich rolled down the window to ask Officer Mike,
where
are were going, the cop, who was not Mike, rolled down his window and
asked,
"Why are you following me?" 
   
Once Rich and I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop
car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked, he led us quickly
to
the emergency vet, where Mike greeted us by holding open the door,
exclaiming  "Where were you guys???" 
   
It was lucky that Mike got to the vet's ahead of us, because we hadn't
thought to call and warn them about what was coming. (Clearly, by this
time
we weren't really thinking at all.) We brought in the kitchen sink
containing Rudy, and the garbage disposal containing his head, and the
clinic staff was ready. They took his temperature (which was down 10
degrees) and his oxygen level (which was half of normal), and the vet
declared, "This cat is in serious shock. We've got to sedate him and get
him
out of there immediately." When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in
shock, the vet said grimly, "We don't have a choice." 
   
With that, he injected the cat. Rudy went limp and the vet squeezed
about
half a tube of K-Y jelly onto the cat's neck and pulled him free.   Then
the
whole team jumped into "code blue" mode. (I know this from watching a
lot of
ER.) They laid Rudy on a cart where one person hooked up IV fluids,
another
put little socks on his paws ("You'd be amazed how much heat they lose
through their footpads," she said), one covered him with hot water
bottles
and a blanket, and another took a blow-dryer to warm up   Rudy's now
very
gunky head. 
   
The fur on his head dried in stiff little spikes, making him look 
pathetically punk as he lay there, limp and motionless. At this point 
they sent Rich, Mike, and me to sit in the waiting room while they tried
to
bring Rudy back to life. I told Mike he didn't have to stay, but he just
stood there, shaking his head. "I've never seen anything like this," he
said
again and again. 
   
At about 3 a.m., the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good
for a full recovery. They needed to keep Rudy overnight to re-hydrate
him
and give him something for the brain swelling they assumed he had, but
if
all went well, we could take him home the following night. Just in time
to
hear the good news, Officer Tom rushed in, finished with his real police
work and concerned about Rudy. 
   
Rich and I got back home about 3:30. We hadn't unpacked from our trip, I
was still intermittently dizzy, and I still hadn't prepared for my 8:40
class. "I need a vacation," I said, and while I called the office to
leave a
message canceling my class, Rich made us a pitcher of martinis. 
   
I slept late the next day and then badgered the vet about Rudy's
condition
until he said that Rudy could come home later that day. I was working on
the
suitcases when the phone rang. "Hi, this is Steve Huskey from the
Norristown
Times-Herald," a voice said. "Listen, I was just going through the
police
blotter from last night. Um, do you have a cat?" 
   
So I told Steve the whole story, which interested him immensely.   A
couple hours later he called back to say that his editor was 
interested, too; did I have a picture of Rudy? The next day Rudy was 
front-page news, under the ridiculous headline "Catch of the Day Lands
Cat
in Hot Water." 
   
There were some noteworthy repercussions to the newspaper article. Mr.
Huskey had somehow inferred that I called 9-1-1 because I thought Rich,
my
husband, was going into shock, although how he concluded this from my
comment that "his pads were turning blue," I don't quite understand. So
the
first thing I had to do was call Rich at work--Rich, who had worked
tirelessly to free Rudy--and swear that I had been misquoted. 
   
When I arrived at work myself, I was famous; people had been calling my
secretary all morning to inquire about Rudy's health. When I called our
regular vet (whom I had met only once) to make a follow-up appointment
for
Rudy, the receptionist asked, "Is this the famous Rudy's mother?"   When
I
took my car in for routine maintenance a few days later, Dave, my
mechanic,
said, "We read about your cat. Is he OK?" When I called a tree surgeon
about
my dying red oak, he asked if I knew the person on that street whose cat
had
been in the garbage disposal. And when I went to get my hair cut, the
shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma had read in the
paper,
about a cat that got stuck in the garbage disposal. 
   
Even today, over a year later, people ask about Rudy, which a 9-year-old
neighbor had always called "the Adventure Cat" because he used to climb
on
the roof of her house and peer in the second-story window at her. 
   
I don't know what the moral of this story is, but I do know that this
"adventure" cost me $1,100 in emergency vet bills, follow- up vet care,
new
sink, new plumbing, new electrical wiring, and new garbage disposal--one
with a cover. The vet can no longer say he's seen everything but the
kitchen
sink. 
   
I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift certificates
to the local hardware store, but was told that they couldn't accept
gifts,
that I would put them in a bad position if I tried. So I wrote a letter
to
the Police Chief praising their good deeds and sent individual thank you
notes to Tom and Mike, complete with pictures of Rudy, so they could see
what he looks like with his head on. 
   
And Rudy, whom we originally got for free (or so we thought), still
sleeps
with me-under the covers on cold nights, and, unaccountably, still
sometimes
prowls the sink, hoping for fish.

On February 27th, the FERC approved TW's Electronic Contracting filing to become effective March 4, 2002.  We made the filing to correspond with the implementation of the new contracting system in Market Services.  Shippers can still contract via fax and in writing; however, they will now (I believe after this coming weekend) by able to do requests and contracting electronically.  This include capacity release.  There were a few minor changes in the shipper requests requirements, but I believe most of these were already occurring; we just updated the tariff language.  

One change which is very different is that a service agreement must be signed and returned within 15 days instead of 30 days. 

If you have any questions, please call myself (x54600) or Teb (x36868).

Thanks so much for your quick turnaround.  Rob Kilmer is adding the regulatory section and we should have that tomorrow.  I still have a lot of other clean up items to take care of but I think we are getting closer.
Thanks,
Kevin

Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an "average rate" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-

Rob and Lindy:
The two major areas that we are lacking for the TW business plan are Customers/contracts and Regulatory.  The attached power point presentation is a draft of a rating agency presentation that is being prepared and should be used as a guide for the narratives.  Since we are under a tight deadline on these business plans, I would very much appreciate it if you both could draft the narrative for your respective areas based upon the attached presenation.  The "story" in the presentation just needs to be translated to a narrative form - one that is in a "offering memorandum" format.  If we could get these by tomorrow mid day would be great.
Thanks,

Kevin

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

Why can't we use 2001 numbers? Is this due to "publicly available information"? This package is being used for financing purposes and thus is excluded from any such limitation.

On slide # 17, as we discussed yesterday, I think we'll have to do without the 2001 throughput numbers because the FERC Form 2's aren't published yet for 2001.  We could update the presentation when the numbers are published.

On slide # 28, there's a note at the bottom "% of Revenue".  What do we need here?  Do I need to get you a number(s)?

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

On Friday, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message.

VOICEMAIL
From:  Steve Cooper
Date:  Friday, March 1, 2002

Hi everybody.  It's Steve Cooper.  It's Friday afternoon, March 1.  I hope everybody has had a great week.  I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop.

The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion.  I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues.  Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable.  I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues.

In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund.  We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees.  I wanted you to be aware of that.  I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset.

Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program.  As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification.

The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee.  We provided to them more data.  Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28.  We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program.

I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority.  It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed.  I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court.  I'll keep you posted on progress.  I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs.  Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail.

The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions.  Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week.  Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases.  And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process.  So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases.

We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract.  It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate.  I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund.  I'd like your input on that.  I thought it was a great idea and very generous.

We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month.  Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there.  I've tried to get around to say hello here and there.  And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz.  Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries.

Other than that I don't have a lot to report.  We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program.  Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area.  I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward.

One other thing ?

We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon.  We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here.  We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting.  I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future.  I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting.

Anyway, as I was saying ? 

Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication.  I hope you have a great weekend.  I'll chat with next week.

Kevin:

I just checked with Rob Kilmer, a TW old hand.  He said that Texas Eastern bought TW before 1974, but he was not sure exactly when.

I suggest that in the Historical Organization Section, we just say "sold to Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation and again to Houston Natural Gas in 1985 ....".

Wayne,

Do you have this contract defined as a HUB contract? I thought that we showed this as a FTS-1 HUB agreement. Please let me know. Also don't you have  specific hard coding tied to the HUB contracts?

Thanks Ramona

Should Cr 24954 (The Northwest Capacity in the Hub) be and FTS-1 contract or should it be an Administrative contract?

It is currently set up as an FTS-1.

Ramona, let's add the PNR POI's that are within the path.  Lindy and I discussed that if a shipper wants to Park or Ride this would mean more revenue for TW.  Let's do it now and eliminate the hassle of adding them later.

Thanks,

TK

Lindy,

While testing the new CMS TW contract system, we have come across situations with the firm contracts & PNR points. We need to know how marketing sets up the PNR points on firm contracts. 

Do you want all valid PNR points within the path, to be added as alternate receipt & delivery points  on every firm contract or do you add the PNR points only on request form the customer? Looking at most of the Firm contracts in production today, I do not see many PNR points attached as alternate points.

Please let us know how we should handle PNR points for firm contracts?

Thanks Ramona

Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Texaco K #25923/25924 Comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4.5% between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes, there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding.  Need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes; and if delivery makeup scheduled, then invoice should be adjusted accordingly.

Please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2/26/02.  I will review again on the 1st.  

Schedulers -  Please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and Marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [some contracts are based on calculations, especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage].

 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

The 2001 numbers are available only in the FERC form 2s and they are not out yet.

Why can't we use 2001 numbers? Is this due to "publicly available information"? This package is being used for financing purposes and thus is excluded from any such limitation.

On slide # 17, as we discussed yesterday, I think we'll have to do without the 2001 throughput numbers because the FERC Form 2's aren't published yet for 2001.  We could update the presentation when the numbers are published.

On slide # 28, there's a note at the bottom "% of Revenue".  What do we need here?  Do I need to get you a number(s)?

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

 << File: TW.model.r0.8.xls >> 
Here's the current rev on the tw model, with two key things that I need you all to review for me.  Please don't distribute to the large group until it is reviewed.

First, Lindy I have put the annual strip prices at the bottom of the "rolloff" tab.  Could you fill in the basis spread pricing that would result from this?

Second, Kevin and Rod - I had to give up on the FVA adjustments made in older models, I just couldn't get it.  Here's what I did; please let me know if there is something wrong with the analysis:
?	IBIT has annual FVA subtracted from it
?	Cash taxes are calculated using IBIT - Interest + FVA + tax/gaap depreciation adjustment
?	GAAP taxes use IBIT without FVA; deferred tax is GAAP-cash tax.
?	Net income is IBIT less GAAP taxes (therefore includes FVA amort)
?	Net Plant includes PP&E depreciation + FVA amortization
?	Retained earnings are standard - old RE + NI - Div's.

In the old model there were tax adjustments, pluses & minuses to equity, deferred credits, & current liabs that just didn't make sense to me.  I hope I've captured the theme of FVA (non-cash charge to NI, not deductible for tax) without the complication.  If not I can add it all back.

Best-
Davis

1. Is the Marketing selling this point as Primary?
2. Shippers would need to adjust their Primary points around on their contracts. If Allocating West of Thoreau.
3. It might encourage LFT if West of Thoreau capacity not full.
4. It might encourage more Back Hauls from various points in the West of Thorea Area.
5. Could we sell Primary to Primary if Receipted West of Thoreau?

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

We still need to bill Conoco the TCR II Surcharges on 20,000 MMBtu per day.  Maybe Michelle can get with Conoco and see how they want it billed.  If they want it billed on their new contract, maybe we can do an amendment.  If they want it billed on the old contracts, then you need to contact someone in the contract group to see how we bill it since the contracts are expired (i.e., overriding the CBS system or something).

Jeanette:

I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.

Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.

Thanks!

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/>	 Three trading conferences under one roof...
at the Hotel Okura, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002	 
 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/>

Over 70% of European companies
face weather-related risk

Today's business has become all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather derivatives have become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging as utilities, airlines, agriculture have at hand to offset risks associated with temperature and precipitation.

So how do you take advantage of this new market in weather trading that has emerged in Europe? What key issues do you have to be aware of to mitigate your operational and trading risks through weather? Amsterdam will be the place for traders, marketers, exchanges, brokers, and executives powering the weather trading industry to network with each other.

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy Industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market.

"Carbon credits represent a significant asset that companies ignore at their peril"
Jonathan Johns, Ernst & Young

Emission trading options are ripe for the picking - but how can you make sure you're ready to profit from GHG? Let's face it - you really can't afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how you can best seize this exciting new market opportunity.

Lindy.

While testing the TMS nomination and scheduling processes that Interface into the new CMS system, I have found a TW Firm contract with Southern Energy Inc. # 26719 that was set up back in May or June of 2000 which has several alt. receipt templates that are outside the primary path. The primay path for this contract is San Juan Bloomfield receipts to Socal Needles as primary delivery. It shows up in production with alt. receipt groups in Central, West Texas, and Panhandle. Is this correct?

Thanks Ramona

Lindy, As mentioned in the phonemail message I left, below is a revised listing of the Order 637 Imbalance provisons filed that we want to either retain or potentially trade in 637 negotiations.  I moved the mandatory cash-out provision into the trade column.  Please review and advise if you agree with the list.  Thanks. gh


Already in TW's Tariff

1.	Dollar valuing.  Need to terminate volumetric OBA's where possible to minimize TW's financial exposure.

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Keep

1.	Definition of 6 indices (vs. 3 in current tariff).
2.	Parties may mutually agree to cash out PNR.  Could probably do today without this language.
3 .	Clarification that PNR may be used by Operators.
4.	May use PNR for "auto-balancing".

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Could "Trade"

1.	Mandatory cash-out each month (after netting and option to trade).
2. 	Daily balancing.  Including daily tolerance, daily auto-transfer to PNR & daily pricing 
3.	Smaller tolerance range.  Proposed change from +/- 10% to +/- 5%.

Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB
TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions 
While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. 
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. 
Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. 
Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. 
TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. 
The pipeline has told the NEB that "with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade." Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that "unconventional gas" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in "tight" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas "is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions." At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that "if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade." 
In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada's educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the "project definition phase," or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. 
Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcf/d south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada's system. 
TransCanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcf/d in 2008 to 900 MMcf/d in '09, 1.1 Bcf/d in 2010, 1.2 Bcf/d in 2011 and 1.4 Bcf/d by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. 
As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it "recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas."

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

The GRI is a voluntary surcharge that the Shipper indicates they want to pay.  We just collect it and pass it on to the Gas Research institute.  The ACA is an Annual Charge Adjustment to recover cost charged to us by FERC.  We typically do not waive or discount this charge.  The other surcharges are due to past settlements and are not applicable to new expansion projects.  These are defined in the Tariff in sections 21 and 23 of the General Terms and Conditions.



Lindy

Did I state this correctly.  Please let Eric and me know if I miss stated anything.

James,

On Sun Devil, are we required to collect GRI, ACA, or any other surcharges?  If so, how are they applied?  If not, why?

From:  Ray Bowen, Office of the Chief Executive 

One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective.

A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.

Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson.  Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls.  

To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process.  In this regard, your cooperation with Rick and his team is appreciated.

Attached is the preliminary CA monthly report for December for your review.  Please verify the following:

TK - The rates under Item 1 (especially those highlighted in pink, which I updated manually by reviewing invoices/transactional reports)
Darrell - The operational capacity and footnotes under Item 3
Terry - The scheduled and/or nominated volumes under Item 1 and 3 (I've done some cross-validations checks but another pair of eyes will help)
Jeanette - Overall data and format for accuracy

Please provide any comments to me no later than COB Monday, 1/21/02, for updates.  Once finalized, I will email to the full distribution list.

 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 1/1/2002.  All transactions were awarded at 100% of the applicable maximum tariff rates.  

I have also been advised by Marketing that another posting may occur for January 2001 (partial month) but nothing has been finalized.  I will send an updated file if necessary.
  
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

 


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Lorraine,

I take it that contracts 25923 and 25924 should remain under Texaco's control?

Lindy and I just discussed this and there may be others; Lindy mentioned expansion deals that may contain MDQ and term stipulations in construction letters, etc...   She's checking...

Bill Rapp requested copies of contracts that deviated from our GISB boiler plate contracts.  He was to review them and determine whether he needed to include them in a project he was working on.  Josh delivered copies of the ones Craig identified below to him on Friday afternoon so I do not think you need to do anything.

Craig,
	What is the definition of "non-standard" for your purposes?  Give me a call to discuss and I'll verify. (X36007)

Lindy Donoho (P# 505520) erroneously had 12/27-28 & 12/31 coded as vacation,
although she did not take them.

Therefore, please add 26 hours to her 2002 available vacation balance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Give me the question and I will make the assumption for now, if you don't feel comfortable doing so.

we need a guess now.  Stan wants a first pass by tomorrow afternoon - we should be able to ballpark this number.

Facilty Planning personnel are out of office today, but will return in the morning.  I have ask for their estimate no later than Monday morning.  They may be able to give me something tommorrow.  I will complete the project model when I get a description of facilities and cost estimates.

James:
Can you roll each of the expansions that we discussed into Rod's project model? Michael Ratner will then link those into the TW financial model.

Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an "average rate" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-
Davis

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Attached is a first draft of the TW business plan requested by Stan.  There are a few remaining items that can be cleaned up on Monday, however, Rod, if Stan would like to see this now, it is in pretty good shape.  I also want to thank everyone for their input into this process.  The ten year forecast was (hopefully!) finalized last night -  I will circulate that as well after I get a chance to review it.  
thanks,
Kevin

Please see attached summary sheet.  The intrinsic value is the value of the basin spread, and the extrinsic is the volatility (time) value.  The correlation being assumed minimizes extrinsic value, so we are only looking at the value of the spread from 2006 onward.

Results are that the basin curves impley over $2bb in continuing value past '06.  Assuming $550 in debt, that provides a PV equity value of $1.45bb.  Add to that the PV of the current contracts, approx $400mm, and you've got a total equity value of approximately $1.85bb.  This is reasonably consistent with the model if we adjust it to include max rates (as the basin curve valuation suggests you should do).

Best-
Davis

Lindy,

We are meeting on Tues at 10:00 in 1336 to discuss how TW may handle a storage point on our system with respect to how we contract for this point (given that contracts will want to receive and deliver to this point on a firm basis) as well as how we schedule gas at this point.  Will you be able to attend and give us your advise?

Many thanks, Kim.

I've attached Michael's most recent version (from Friday) of the PowerPoint presentation I put together and I've incorporated Tracy's comments (from yesterday).  Ron Matthews had drafted a history for Tracy - it appears on a slide in the presentation.

This is all we have as far as a basic overview and history.

I didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday, so I'll ask you.  Is Gina Taylor's group working on a draft of the Business Plan?  I understood from Tracy in our meeting with Steve last Friday that someone in Gina's group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation.  Do you know if that's happening?

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Should Cr 24954 (The Northwest Capacity in the Hub) be and FTS-1 contract or should it be an Administrative contract?

It is currently set up as an FTS-1.

	Here we are.  If something is glaringly off, I will have my cell & pager, I'm going to grab some lunch.  Cell is 7/303.1297.

	Key assumptions -$200mm new equity in '03 to fund $300mm in expansions.  Debt reaches 50/50 cap ratio by '04.  reduced ltd to $500 in '02.

	The average ROIC as you get out in the future is on the order of 7%, which is greater than the wacc, so there is reasonableness to the positive valuation.

	Please advise how we should prepare to present.

Kevin:

I just checked with Rob Kilmer, a TW old hand.  He said that Texas Eastern bought TW before 1974, but he was not sure exactly when.

I suggest that in the Historical Organization Section, we just say "sold to Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation and again to Houston Natural Gas in 1985 ....".

Due to the large number of moves recently, many locations and phones numbers are incorrect in Peoplefinder.  If your information is incorrect, our HR staff has sent the instructions below on how you can correct your data.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call us.

Mail stop - this is how your paycheck (if your pay method is hard copy) and other mail comes to you.  Updates should be e-mailed by the employee or a department administrative assistant to Kenneth Mathews along with the person's P number.  Here is a link to a mail stop listing so that you can choose the correct mail stop:

	http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp?cabinet_id=127   Select number 10. Mail Stop Listing.

Room Location - this is the room number that shows up in directories such as Peoplefinder.  Updates should be done by the each employee by logging in to eHRonline and choosing "Work Contact Information", make the change and save.

Work Address (street address) - this information is located on eHRonline under "Work Contact Information" but cannot be updated by employees; this address does not effect where you get your mail (the mail stop does).  However, it is being updated through HR by the ISC; it will be sometime next week before the ISC loads this information into SAP due to some other delays; this will change the address in eHRonline from 333 Clay to 1400 Smith

Here we are.  If something is glaringly off, I will have my cell & pager, I'm going to grab some lunch.  Cell is 7/303.1297.

Key assumptions -$200mm new equity in '03 to fund $300mm in expansions.  Debt reaches 50/50 cap ratio by '04.  reduced ltd to $500 in '02.

The average ROIC as you get out in the future is on the order of 7%, which is greater than the wacc, so there is reasonableness to the positive valuation.

Please advise how we should prepare to present.

Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated this afternoon on the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
Citizens K #20822 Res - flowed alternate deliveries to Socal Needles of 32,145 dth and should be billed incremental fees [I have prepared a spreadsheet to calculate at the max applicable tariff rate for the alternate path]
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item

RE: CALIFORNIA 3rd QUARTER PRODUCTION REPORT

Lippman Consulting, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has just completed 
the 3rd quarterly of 2001 gas production report for the state of California. 
This report contains text and graphs depicting various historical statistics. 
The total California production volumes are separated by associated and 
non-associated volumes. The report also separates production by state and 
federal areas as well as onshore and offshore volumes. For the onshore 
volumes, we detail the production down to the district level while for the 
offshore volumes, we detail those down to the field level. In addition to 
showing historical production volumes in various categories, the report also 
provides the reader with monthly net gas storage injection and withdrawal 
volumes along with the total gas volumes in storage for the state. Working 
gas as well as cushion gas levels are also reported.  California is a major 
consuming district and the level of production contained within the state has 
a direct bearing on the amount of gas imports that will be needed to satisfy 
demand.

The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the 
report can be purchased on a one time basis for $450.  If you would like 
additional information or to order the report, please feel free to contact me 
by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

George Lippman, 
President

The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the "other" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says "empty deleted items folder upon exit".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
Outbound - For outbound quarantined messages, an e-mail needs to be sent to IT Security and Controls (itsecurityandcontrols@enron.com) with the recipient's address and the subject line of message.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call us at:


ETS Solution Center - Houston		713-345-4745

I thought you might be interested in this.  I have no profit motive.  I am just sharing some research that I have done.

Subject: Outstanding College Savings Plan


Are you concerned about saving for college expenses?  If you are interested
in what I have learned, read on.  If not, delete this now and save yourself
from my poor grammar.

I started my own savings program for our kids a couple years ago, but it
wasn't very tax efficient.  Up until last year, there really wasn't a very
easy way to save for college.  You basically had 2 choices:  Educational IRA
that had contributions limited to $500 per year and you didn't qualify if
you were "rich".  The other was Prepaid College Tuition programs like the
Texas Tomorrow Fund.  The prepaid tuition programs are a good deal if you
know your kid is going to go to an in state, public school because you can
lock in tuition rates now.  It doesn't cover room & board and if your kid
goes out of state or to a private school, they will gladly give you your
money back without much growth.

A couple of years ago, Congress authorized what are know as Section 529
plans.  Each state is authorized to set up their own plan, cover different
expenses, allow different investment options and charge different fees.  One
of the best web sites I found to give me a basic background and help me
compare state plans was www.savingsforcollege.com.  This web site is packed
full of information.

Some of the features that make the 529 plans great are (each state varies on
some options):
High contribution limits (current max is $251,000 per beneficiary)
The account owner maintains control (forever) and the money is moved out of
the account owner's estate.
You can switch beneficiaries to anyone else in the family from grandparents
out to first cousins.
Multiple Investment Options from 100% Equity to 100% bonds and time adjusted
portfolios.
Qualified withdrawals cover tuition, books, room & board at all
(nationwide)accredited 2 and 4 year colleges and most technical schools.
Tax free growth on qualified withdrawals.

Each state plan has it's own quirks.  Several states, including Texas do not
even have a plan set up yet.  You really have to evaluate several state
plans to figure out what is best for you.  Each state charges a management
fee for maintaining these accounts.  The fees I found varied from 0.30% to
1.05% annually based on your account balance.  Some states only allow front
loaded mutual funds and/or make you go through a broker.  This can really
add up.

I looked for a plan that had high contribution limits to cover the most
expensive schools and aid in estate planning.  A low annual management fee
was very important to me.  I was also concerned with investment options.  I
like picking my own portfolio styles.  Some states don't give you too many
options because they think they know better.  I also found a state that
allows you to switch your investment selections once a year.  Most states
currently prohibit investment changes from what was selected when you make a
contribution.  I think this prohibition was due to a tax law that was
recently revised to allow investment switching.

I decided to go through New Mexico 529 plan.  There web site is
www.theeducationplan.com/education/SS/splash.jsp.  I was able to set up my
accounts on-line in a couple of minutes each.

I think this is the best investment vehicle for saving for college.  Let me
know what you think.  If you have any questions, I would be happy to reply.

monthly pipeline reports by adding two new pipelines. The two new systems are 
the Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company and  the CMS Trunkline Gas 
Company. Both of these two new reports will contain the same detailed 
information on the major receipts and deliveries along these pipelines as our 
clients have grown to expect. With these two reports, we have completed our 
coverage of the Rocky Mountain region and expanding our coverage of the Gulf 
Coast region. Over the next few months, our clients will see continuing 
expansion of our pipeline reporting coverage in the Gulf Coast region.   

The cost for either one of these reports is $110 per month on an annual 
subscription or the reports can be purchased on a one-time basis for $330. As 
a reminder, our Retainer Clients will receive these new reports at no 
additional charge. If you would like additional information on our Retainer 
Client services or to order the report, please feel free to contact me by 
e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

George Lippman,
President
Lippman Consulting, Inc.

Subject:	Draft - SoCal/Topock Announcement

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

As reported in Gas Daily today, the CPUC has issued a report assessing the state's gas infrastructure of the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide seasonally reliable amounts of competitively priced natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  Other conclusions: conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure, improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability, and the CPUC should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions.  Below is the link if you would like to review the entire report.  gh

T.K., Lindy,

I have set up new groups for TW in the PLE system that emulate the templets in CBS.  I would like to get together with you and review the lists or give you a copy and have you review them.  Do you have some time this afternoon for me to come down with the lists?  Let me know.

Thanks

It is with sincere sadness that I inform you of a tragedy that occurred.  Doug Hammer, an Enron Northern Natural Gas senior operations and maintenance technician located at the LNG facility in Wrenshall, Minnesota, died earlier this week.  Doug gave many years of dedicated service to EOTT and most recently Northern Natural Gas.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Doug's family.
 
Recognizing this is a difficult time for us all, the Enron Employee Assistance Program is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Please call 713.853.6057, or 1.800.345.1391 for assistance.  

Additional information about the program is also available via the Enron intranet site at: <http://hrweb.enron.com/employeeServices/workLife/resourcesReferrals.asp>

The Telephony Team performed maintenance over the weekend which impacted the user voicemail that moved from 3AC.  Although the Telephony Group is working on restoring the voicemail the problem may not be resolved before Friday.

Lindy, 
Current situation:
we are planning on subscribing 70.8% of east leg capacity, with 5% currently under long term contracts (therefore, 65.8% will be resubscribed at the max rate).  This produces the current total revenue figure of $186.6mm.  that is $9.4mm less than '05's subscription revenue.
On the phone, you suggested increasing subscribed volumes in the East to produce an incremental $4.8mm in reservation revenue.  This takes the current subscription rate on the East from 70.8% to 87.8%.  
Question -
Would this increase apply to '06 only?  If so, East subscription rates are 71.2% in '04, 70.5% in '05, 87.8% in '06.  If we can subscribe more on the East in '06, why not do it in '05?  If we do it in '05, then we increase '05 reservation revenue by ~$4.8mm also - total reservation revenue in '05 would be $200.3mm, and in '06 it would be $190.9mm - still the $9.8mm hole.
We can discuss further at the meeting tomorrow a.m.

Lorraine,
	This is Southern's Gallup contract.  I've looked at our yellow file we keep down here and the original agreement only allowed alt RP's & DP's within the path, in the direction of flow, at the discounted rate.  Then, I see an amendment to allow them alternate DP's at the CA Border.  I don't see anything else here.  Are you aware of any deals that allowed them to use alt RP's in East of Thoreau?

Ramona,
	Can you ask Dennis to look in Envision &/or pull the official contract file for you and check to see if there are any other amendments? 

Thanks, 
Lindy

Lindy.

While testing the TMS nomination and scheduling processes that Interface into the new CMS system, I have found a TW Firm contract with Southern Energy Inc. # 26719 that was set up back in May or June of 2000 which has several alt. receipt templates that are outside the primary path. The primay path for this contract is San Juan Bloomfield receipts to Socal Needles as primary delivery. It shows up in production with alt. receipt groups in Central, West Texas, and Panhandle. Is this correct?

Thanks Ramona

Jan,
	I had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together, but I wasn't sure if it was the final, actuals for 2001.  What was TW's total actual throughput for 2001?

You are correct.  I've got my units confused - the amount on slide #11 should be 110 MMcfd.  

On the San Juan slide #14, I've left out a phrase from the report.  The report reads " total basin wellhead production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/cd and is expected to decline almost 22%,  about 2.4% per year, to 3.4 Bcf/cd by 2010".  In the tabular information of the study, 1999 begins with 4,306 MMcf/d and 2010 ends with 3,351 MMcf/d.

My question on slide 11 may be an issue of units.  If the increase is from 6400 MMcfd to 7500 MMcfd, should the increase amount be 110 MMcfd vs 110000MMcfd?

Separately, on slide 14, can you tell me how the 2.4% decline is calculated?  If it is based on the 4.3 Bcfd down to 3.5 Bcfd shouldn't it be a 1.8% decline?

Thanks,

Michael

The note "need to verify" appears on this slide, after the bullet "110,000 MMcfd annual average increase".

I calculated this average annual amount from the first bullet "CA's natural gas use will increase from 6,400 MMcfd in 2000 to 7,500 MMcfd in 2010".  The first bullet and the third bullet are from the same source as the graph, The California Energy Commission.  Specifically, it's from their "California Natural Gas Analysis and Issues" Staff Report, dated November 2000.  The CEC's more current report from October, 2001, did not include specific long-term demand projections (it is focused on infrastructure issues).

That's the source of the numbers on this slide.

Please see attached summary sheet.  The intrinsic value is the value of the basin spread, and the extrinsic is the volatility (time) value.  The correlation being assumed minimizes extrinsic value, so we are only looking at the value of the spread from 2006 onward.

Results are that the basin curves impley over $2bb in continuing value past '06.  Assuming $550 in debt, that provides a PV equity value of $1.45bb.  Add to that the PV of the current contracts, approx $400mm, and you've got a total equity value of approximately $1.85bb.  This is reasonably consistent with the model if we adjust it to include max rates (as the basin curve valuation suggests you should do).

Best-
Davis

That's what I was asking Jan previously - does the 1.8 Bcf/d include any estimates or is that an actual number?

Gina, I am waiting for Steve to respond to two e:mails I've sent him requesting comments on the slide.  He is in Dallas today.

Jan,
	I had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together, but I wasn't sure if it was the final, actuals for 2001.  What was TW's total actual throughput for 2001?

I see at the bottom of the Business Plan where Tracy has asked for written assumptions for the forecast from you.  Has this been completed?  Steve would like to see this by sometime tomorrow morning for his review before our 2:00 meeting.  When will we have this?

We have been working hard over the past three months to restore normalcy to the non-debtor companies in the EGS family of asset-based businesses.   We are doing our best to operate on a business as usual basis, and continue the regular, consistent programs we previously provided.  That is why earlier this year we paid performance bonuses and merit increases to most non-debtor employees, in the ordinary course of business. 

At the same time, I understand that events of the past few months have been disturbing and left many with a sense of uncertainty about their future.  We realize that you need some sort of "safety net" to allow you to be comfortable staying here as we work to reorganize.  With this in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have put in place a severance plan for U.S. employees of certain non-debtor companies.  We have wanted this program for some time, but even as a non-debtor company we had to work extensively with consultants and creditors in securing its approval.

The severance plan provides that, under most circumstances, terminated employees would be eligible for two weeks of base pay for every full or partial year of service.  In the case of a termination due to reorganization, the minimum compensation would be eight weeks of pay and the maximum would be fifty-two weeks.  The details and restrictions to this plan are explained in the plan summary for your company's plan, which can be found on the ETS HR link on the Enron Transportation Services intranet site under "ETS HR Manuals". It can also be accessed by clicking on the attached weblink:  http://hrweb.enron.com/businessUnits/ets/etsHRmanuals.asp . 

I hope this plan will give you a bit more peace of mind and allow you to continue the excellent work you have been providing in our ongoing businesses.  Please contact your HR representative, if you have any questions about the severance plan or related matters.

Stan
