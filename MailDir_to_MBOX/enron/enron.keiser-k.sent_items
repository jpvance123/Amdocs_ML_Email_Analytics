Kam,

Are there any new developments in the trader world?  We still have the traders and books that you provided last week, but need to know if there are any changes to this.  Please let us know if you need a change so that the deals will bridge with the correct books.

Thanks,
Dawn

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Subject:	Counterparties w/Master Agreements with ECC

This is how the logic is now within UBSWenergy.com:

All counterparties with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the position out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the appropriate risk book (the book on the online product).  This applies only to finanical swaps and not physical deals.

Please let me know if there is going to be a change and if so what the deals should look like in Tagg.  The programmers need time to modify logic and I need time to test!

Thanks for your help.

Suzanne,

I was wondering if you had a chance to research the below note.  Furthermore, please note the updated file attached.  There are no changes volumetrically from the last file, but there are some price differences.  Basically, Coral has taken these deficiency charges in their final settlement with Nov-01 prod.  So, the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges.  Please advise on what you might know about this from a scheduling point of view when possible.

Kam,

We talked briefly about this before the holidays.  The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral.  However, I assume that you need to be in the loop to also verify the overall deficiency charges and ultimately approve the creation of demand charges on the appropriate deals.  Please let me know where you stand on this or what might be my next steps in cleaning this up.

Thanks,

Suzanne,

Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.  The worksheet of concern is titled "Sched".  Each deal is listed by group.  That is to say that they are not listed by day, but the days in question are mentioned for each group.  Furthermore, the volumes on the left of each group are from Coral's data, whereas the right side contains ENA data or my calculations.  Please prioritize these as you can with the expectation that I might be able to work on this upon my return from vacation on Jan 2.

Kam - these deals were zeroed out for all months, not just Dec-01.  I need the demand charge put back in for the missing months:

CP		Deal		Amount		Month(s)		Fee Type
NUI Utilities	715090		$9,958,461		11/01			Demand Charge
VNG		602020		$161,901.45		5/01 - 11/01		Demand Charge
City of Union	452091		Trigger 838/day @$6.39 	2/01 - 11/01		Trigger

As seen below,
 
Please start using the ENA DPR 0102 file rather than the EWS DPR 2002 file to send to Chris.  The positions needed to be divided to reflect BCF's.  
 
Thanks

could you also CC me the first few times you send it?

While our established schedules of Tuesday and Friday DPR's would have us reporting tomorrow's activity on Monday, we will change that for month end.  Please email the January 31st DPR information for your respective groups to my attention by noon on Friday.  You should use the same spreadsheet format used for the 1/29/02 DPR.  All p&l and PRMA numbers should be in $'000's.  
 
Starting in February, you will be able to export the data, as opposed to using the spreadsheets.

Cheryl,

Thanks for taking care of these so quickly.

I have reattached the central book request with some additional books.  The blue highlighted "Cent" books were on the original request but were labeled as "FB" and should have been PB as the book name.  I assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it.  Is that correct?
I corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom.

Thanks again,

Kam

The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.


Thanks,

Scott,
 
I did the last four pages of this.  The pages before that look like they have already been done.  I just spot checked most of them but the entire first page was done already.  I didn't want to waste time, Bridgette is out until next year so I couldn't ask her what the problem is.  I'll leave the pages on your desk.

Jeff, 

Please find part 6 of the ENA deals that still need to be moved into the bankruptcy books as a result of our contracts auto-terminating.   We have been compiling a list of deals that will need further review by Legal and/or Risk and will have these to you very soon as well.  

Since Stacy Richardson is on vacation, feel free to call me 3-3818.  If not, please call any of the people listed above if you should have any questions or concerns with this data.

#992523 is the valid deal.  When the second deal was created, the deand charges should have been deleted.

It has been fixed.

Anne,

For Nov. 2001, ENA billed Northwest Natural Gas for demand charges on deal # 992523 and deal # 967236. The total amount for each deal was $127,500.00 (300,000 @ $.425). The customer paid for only one of the deals. Do you know if both deals are valid and the customer is responsible for paying both? (Note: the comments on deal # 967236 state - seller's choice, if gas is delivered @ Caly Basin use # 992523.) Please advise.

Thanks,
Genaro

Question:

Once the new database for ERMS is split for Netco. we will have to make some changes to the gas daily curve mapping tables.  Is there another way to create these mappings other than adding them one at a time.  We are getting rid of a large percentage of curves and will be making many changes to the current mappings.  Doing it one by one will be very time consuming and I want to see if you are able to load them another way.

Jeff Gossett told me that you are working on the new Estate book for performing deals.  We were wondering when this book would be finalized and when all the deals would be moved over into the new Performance book.  Could you just let me know when you think it will be finished.  Thanks for all your help.

We will get you the FT-Ontario and Intra-Ontario.  Please call Brian Gillis in Canada for the FT-Canada book.  Do you know what the full name for FT-US-Can is, that name doesn't exist in TAGG.

Thanks

Kam,

Could you please provide us with the calculations  and post IDs of the following books using the same criteria that you used for the Bankruptcy book:

	FT US CAN
	FT Canada
	FT Ontario (Canadian)
	FT Intra Ontario

I know that you may not run all these books, but could you help me find the applicable people so that we may obtain the same information that you provided to us on the Bankruptcy book.

Genaro, we restructured the deal effective with November deliveries.  I have a copy of the document if you need it.  Phillip Love and Kam Keiser are familiar with the deal if they can help.  The customer is correct in their pricing.

Frank/Scott,

Are either of you handling deal # 22957 (sell to TBG Cogen)? There is a price discrepancy for Nov. 2001.

TBG Cogen Partners is disputing the rate invoiced by ENA for November 2001 gas. ENA invoiced a rate of $3.4367 for deal # 22957. The customer claims the rate should be as follows: first 4,000/d @ $2.25, remainder over 4,000 @ monthly index of delivery location + $.025. Please review and advise.

Thanks,
Genaro

Kam, John, we found a few book_id name issues while trying to batch-load the books.

We were able to figure out the issues ourselves, but for your reference here are the changes we made:


FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	P	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	D	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	I	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	M	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	Y	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	

Note all 5 books were labeled as 'FB-EXECUTIVE'.  We instead named them

FB-EXECUTIVE-PRC
FB-EXECUTIVE-BAS
FB-EXECUTIVE-IDX
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDM
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDY

Also, we found these two books that had the same book ID:

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST1	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST10	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

Note that the second book should be named 'FB-WEST10-GDM', based on the WEST10 Region Code.

We fixed that one as well.

Please update your spreadsheet, and let us know if we need to discuss in the morning.

The next step is the hierarchy, which we should receive from Stephanie or Debbie in the morning.  Thanks.

Andrew

Debbie,

The credit committee needs to get some information from us that I could use your help with.  Can I get a dump of the non-terminated deals into excel and I will format it from there.  The information they need to see are the counterparty name, cash flows (MTM value) and positions.
As always, they need it by 11:00 this morning so if you could let me know if this is something your group could provide me with I would appreciate it. 

Thanks

The 7849 are all in-the-money financial counterparties and all physical deals we are performing on.  We have gotten shorter because that is not all positions we are reporting.  To the true DPR we are reporting additional books but we were told for this purpose you only wanted the deals we plan to perform on.  We don't need the East/West for gas.  I will fill in those additional columns for tomorrows report.  Will you be sending out a new form or shall I make the changes?  Do you want an email daily or have you set up a file for these to be saved into?
Is Canada doing their part?

Is that all of ENA Gas?(We can do away with the East and West and just report it as US)  Have we really gotten that much shorter from 11/30, when we were (219) BCF short?  2) Can you also provide the p&l numbers for columns Q through T?

Here are the curves loaded for East, Texas, West and Central on November 30th.  They are also saved in O:\_Dropbox\Kam\Nov 30 Curves if you need to make any changes.
I left a copy of all broker quotes from that day on your desk.

All broker quotes are saved in O:\erms\1intra\broker quotes.  Here are a few samples.
      





These are the curves for each region....basis, index, gas daily & physical.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Also as per our conversation with Kam, all PB-HDG books set up from the original list have been removed from the database as they were not supposed to be set up in Tagg/Erms.

Here is an updated version of the template, it should be easier to use as you have all split out your books into 3 (terminated by the counterparty, not being fulfilled, and active).  Again, this should be as of positions held today.  Based on my discussions with you so far, it looks like this is doable by the end of next week.

Please call me if you have questions.

Best regards

Suzanne,

I was wondering if you had a chance to research the below note.  Furthermore, please note the updated file attached.  There are no changes volumetrically from the last file, but there are some price differences.  Basically, Coral has taken these deficiency charges in their final settlement with Nov-01 prod.  So, the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges.  Please advise on what you might know about this from a scheduling point of view when possible.

Kam,

We talked briefly about this before the holidays.  The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral.  However, I assume that you need to be in the loop to also verify the overall deficiency charges and ultimately approve the creation of demand charges on the appropriate deals.  Please let me know where you stand on this or what might be my next steps in cleaning this up.

Thanks,

Suzanne,

Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.  The worksheet of concern is titled "Sched".  Each deal is listed by group.  That is to say that they are not listed by day, but the days in question are mentioned for each group.  Furthermore, the volumes on the left of each group are from Coral's data, whereas the right side contains ENA data or my calculations.  Please prioritize these as you can with the expectation that I might be able to work on this upon my return from vacation on Jan 2.

Hey,

I am going to have to miss your wedding.  Unfortunately, I will be in Plano that weekend.  I wish I could make it.

What's going on with the UBS weather position?  Has that gone anywhere or are the other possibilities you had better?

Talk to you soon,

It was just a funny song making fun of Enron.  You didn't miss out on much.
I signed the offer letter last week, and we went through the orientation and filled out the piles of paperwork.  I won't have the new title and company name officially until the 8th I heard.  

What is up with you?  How's the car treating you?  Were you able to sell the maroon thing?
I'm house shopping now, I want to build one, just don't know where.  It is fun looking though.

Talk to you later,

KK

I started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara.  I don't think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months.  I started comparing the Bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc. and fixed as much as I could for the East and West, I just started on Central but we should check this all again on Monday.  Because of this, we have not reported any prompt month physical value.  The rates group hasn't been around to get the demand charges either.  We should have everything clean to report it on Monday.

Going forward I guess we need to show people how to check it correctly.

See you on Monday.

Kam

Do you guys know which books each of your people will be doing?  There is a column for that in the trader matrix under the controls folder.  Ramesh will be loading our information into risktrac for us once we have all of the information, book admin id is one of the fields he needs. 

When you have decided can you please input that into the trader matrix and I'll then forward everything to Ramesh.

Thanks

Have you started to set up any new books for NetCo. yet?

Do you guys think we should all use the same book and portfolio codes this time to make mini-books easier?
Also, I think we should have some consistency in book names (make them more descriptive).  any other suggestions?

Dawn has given us until noon Wednesday to get them the final list of EOL products and book mappings.  I know with the trader changes last Friday these will change again.  
The traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves, and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations.  Since we will be testing everything on Thursday, we need to have our curve files ready to load on Wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc.  
The west traders are looking at theirs now, can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files, and let them change any links?

We also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to, but doesn't give them access to any of our other files, so the current location will not be the final.  We can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to UBS.

Thanks

KK

Now that the auction is underway and the possibility of being purchased in very high, we need to get back in gear, TODAY.

1.	Everyone needs to be here no later than 8:00am, 7:30 once we start trading again
2.	No playing on the internet or other games (ex. cards) - this will no longer be tolerated
3.	I have said this many times before but this is the ideal time to LEARN.
		bring in your options books or anything else that you can read to learn more about the energy industry
		start studying the firms rolls, learn what the macros do, develop new checks and balances
		become more familiar with forwards and options details and other excel queries and where the curves come from
		understand the curve files (these will change but the general format will be similar)
		
Just to be clear, this is coming down from Jeff Gossett.  
The list for NetCo. is not set in stone and can be changed if someone steps up, or if someone doesn't.

We are still getting paid everyday and should be putting our time into the company.
I know it has been boring but things need to change starting today, things will start to pick up in the next few days.

The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14th.

I would like to get your ideas for changes/improvements to our current processes/systems.  We have a slightly improved firm roll to use but nothing else has changed.
This is our chance to change the things we couldn't before.  There is no reason why we have to continue doing things the same as before.

Please seriously think about this over the next few days and get back to me with any ideas you have, no matter how small, every little bit helps.

Come talk to me if you have any questions or concerns,

Thanks,
Kam

Give me a call if you have any questions.  I guess the next step is to clean up a few items on the attached spread sheet and then assign a value to each contract.  We need to come up with a plan for factoring in LDs with the MTM exposure.

Stephen,

I made a copy of your BenchbyTrader and cleaned it up a little by taking out all the hidden rows and old traders.  It is saved to the same directory as UBS BenchByTrader.xls


Can you look at this and check the macros to make sure it all still works?  Can you use that going forward?

Thanks

KK

Could we change the gas daily intra-month and index to GDM and GDY, rather than GDL and GDX.  Tell me how much trouble that is to change.  IT also made some changes to the physical org region names.  I will have to get you those changes.

I think I fixed the trailblazer path....the curve description on the curves tab didn't match the contract CB tab.  The ref# should go away once you roll it for today.  Try that this morning and let me know if it works.

Susan,  

We are unable to book any sitara deals to this book.  It doesn't look like it is set up as a business unit.

Do you know what we need to do to fix it?

Brian,

Actually we rolled out the 2 leg logic with ECC to start with, with the intention of rolling out the same logic for you guys.  I worked with Kathy last year on this but we never got the programming worked out with the Tagg bridge.  Believe it or not, it was easier to identify the companies with ECC contracts than develop logic around all the counterparties with master agreements with ENA.  I will bring this up, again, to the Tagg people and see what the time frame is on getting this working for you guys.  I think it will be a while considering they are working with all the estate and database programming.  

Hopefully, we can get that for you soon.

Dawn,

At this stage, I haven't heard any indications we wouldn't continue to operate this way.  

One important thing here is that this 2 leg logic was never applied to the US counterparties we deal with - so we end up having to book a second leg on any deals we do with a Houston counterparty in EOL.  Since this was obviously considered to be worth doing for the US, I don't see why we wouldn't do it for Canada too - it would be a significant time saver.

Kam, Kathy and Brian,

Concerning the ECC - Riskmantra logic that EOL has in place to convert the transactions that are done with counterparties with ECC master agreements...are we going to continue this way of booking (2 legs)?  If so, can you review the list of counterparties that follows the "2-leg" logic and let me know if there need to be any additions or deletions?

Thanks,
Dawn

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.


CP ID	Short Name	Code	Region	Commodity	Uom	Currency	Commodity/UOM/Curr	P	B	Idx	GD	PHY	Y

After speaking with Kim Theriot in confirmations, we will not be using the RiskMantra entity, per the legal department.  All Canada to US deals should be booked ENA to ECC (using the new legal entities of course) rather than RiskMantra.  She is waiting on the final word about our new legal entity names, I will let you know what I hear. 

Thanks

Kam

You still have access to test - the data is just old - but strangely won't effect you too much.   Doubt it will be refreshed - due to production being the priority.   

Stephanie will set you up in the new production by the end of the day.  Don't get too excited - it all looks the same.  
All the programming effort has been put on the website.

You will have access soon - Stephanie will send you your ID's and passwords.

We have a lot of work to do in there - so we don't want everyone in there quite yet.  The problem is - if traders are playing with the products while we are trying to re-build the products and data elements with UBS names - we are going to have issues.

The other thing I want to make sure everyone understands - this is our new production data base - not a test data base.  
There are a limited number of authorized users assigned to "testing" or playing around with the data - and they are responsible for cleaning it up too.   
We will allow people to play for the simulation only.

Once we finish building our UBS production data base - we will the copy it to our test data base - and resume our bridge testing from there to the other test environments (our test environment still has the old Enron data).

We have decided to take the curve history with us to UBS for the attached curves.  We have changed the names for some of the curves so column J has additional curves that we would like to bring history.  We will not continue publishing those in the future however.

Jeff,

I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco.  As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, "MF".  When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region.  When we pull the "MF" book code with "Financial" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc.  We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.  I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.  Do you know of another field that would provide this information?

thanks

Min,

Is this change only for those using EnPower?  My group will no longer be running any power books and won't need EnPower any longer. 

If this affects the gas applications in any way let me know, but I think that this won't be necessary for me.

Dear Kam,

The Oracle Power database has been moved. The Excel Applications which are involved with the database need to be modified. So does your PCs' setting.

Please let us know when we can go to your desk for the changes. The time only need < 20 minutes.

Kam,

Could you please provide us with the calculations  and post IDs of the following books using the same criteria that you used for the Bankruptcy book:

	FT US CAN
	FT Canada
	FT Ontario (Canadian)
	FT Intra Ontario

I know that you may not run all these books, but could you help me find the applicable people so that we may obtain the same information that you provided to us on the Bankruptcy book.

Debbie,

The credit committee needs to get some information from us that I could use your help with.  Can I get a dump of the non-terminated deals into excel and I will format it from there.  The information they need to see are the counterparty name, cash flows (MTM value) and positions.
As always, they need it by 11:00 this morning so if you could let me know if this is something your group could provide me with I would appreciate it. 

Thanks

Kam

Kam,

As we discussed this morning, the traders will be using their physical books to log onto EOL with the exception of the financial desk (John Arnold and team).  Behind the scenes, EOL will  set these traders up in the Counterparty Alternates table to have the books "flip" to the respective financial book when a financial trade is hit.  

Also, any word yet on the traders wanting a different book for price, basis and index.  We are still under the assumption that the trades will book under one book.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Dawn

Thomas is setting up a new NGP&L file and would like us to save a copy of each P&L to Netco\2002\0102\region#0102.  Once you decide how you are going to break them up, one file for each book or combine them together, can you save them out there so he can start linking them.

I think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot.

We are in the process of making new deal tickets for UBS and I would like to get your input.  Could you look at the attached ticket and delete, add or change anything you want to.  Everyone will be using this format for all non-EOL deals, one ticket per trade.

Kevin,

We have over 400 books that were getting officialized at that time.  I tried to get from everyone which post-id's they used that day from Houston, Chicago and Calgary but with that many books we are bound to get a wrong post-id or miss one.  I need to get the list from credit or RAC to be sure we have the right information.  I have yet to hear from them today. 
I also told Z to run with what he had and I'll get with him asap if I find it was wrong.

Thanks
Kam

Raj,

I spoke with Zhiyong and they are going to run the script overnight and give a status in the morning.  

Kam has sent Zhiyong a tentative list and is confirming with RAC that she has all the right post id's.  I have asked Zhiyong to run with the tentative list.

US Global Products and Coal Post ID's have been sent to Zhiyong.  We will send the London Global products post id's first thing in the morning.

EIM book data has been extracted via a fetch macro and we have begun creating the schedule A for those books and hope to have it for cob tomorrow.

Sheila Glover and Clara Carrrington are working on the fx/interest rate books and Sheila will provide an update on progress cob tomorrow.


Kam, Zhiyong, Todd and Sheila,

If any of the above is incorrect, please feel free to correct.

Kevin

We are trying to wrap up the year end reporting this week.  Please let me know if you are still having issues reporting and/or when to expect the year end data.  Some of you may not be familiar with the "export" process to get data to the Consolidated DPR.  If not, please call me and I can help.

In order to streamline getting users set up for access to the new environment supporting "Netco" (old EnronOnline applications),
we need to have the names and userids of your staff needing these applications.

In order to minimize processing several requests individually, we will use these lists to eliminate deletion of the names in the current database. This will save us from having to recreate them, which will save time on both sides. 

BUT, we need this information by 11AM tomorrow. Sorry for the late notice but IT has defined the deadline.

Thank you for your assistance.

O'neal Winfree currently manages the Texas risk management group for natural gas and is also responsible for the benchmark reporting group.  He works closely with the Desk director and other traders to ensure accurate reporting of the positions and P&L's.  He has eliminated most OA variances on his desk and has helped the other regions as well.  O'neal and his group recently created a new physical P&L reporting tool to assist the risk and trading groups.
  
Scott Palmer is currently the East desk lead and was the central desk lead prior to that.  He set up and managed the Wellhead region and created new reporting tools for the traders to manage their supply.  He was also responsible for calculating and reporting the Virginia Natural Gas asset management book and worked closely with the structuring group and others at VNG and Sequent to resolve any issues or questions.  
 
James Hungerford has been a book administrator on the East region for the past six months.  He quickly became an important part of the team by managing up to three traders' P&L's and making numerous improvements to our daily routines such as streamlining the Weapon-X database, automating the new deal checkout and implementing a daily VaR estimate process.  Prior to risk management, James was the Operational Analysis coordinator for the east region and worked with risk management and other downstream groups to clean-up all past variances and helped eliminate future problems.

We are working on this now.  We have a book with all physical active trades we will be performing on, we are now working on getting the in-the-money financial trades separated into a new book.  Once that book is ready and deals are moved, we will be able to report it to you.  

Thanks,

Any thing that is not terminated per legal.

I am sure they will want them split between in the money and out of the money.

Hey guys,

Each book should have been split into 3 books - 

- terminated by the counterparty
- ongoing transactions (active) and
- transactions that have not yet been terminated by a counterparty but that we are not going to fullfil.

The DPR should only have the active transactions in it. Hope that clarifies!

Russ,

Can we get a list of the mappings for all sitara locations.  We are modifying our curve files by getting rid of all "internal" curves.  We need to make sure that we don't have anything mapped to those curves and if so make some changes.

We also need to think about how this change will work with the estate as well.  Will sitara have a separate database for Netco and estate like TAGG will?

Kam

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... ( if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

We don't have access to UBS applications today.  They are supposed to make the switch for us tonight.  I have Stephanie a list of risk people that need access to the reports so after tonight we'll be able to test it out. 

Thanks

Subject:	Access to UBS application

To prepare for the simulation test that will run this week, can you please make sure the necessary people in your group have the appropriate access to the UBS application to perform their job function.  For example, I know that the Reports application was used by most groups and that the risk groups also used the Bridge Monitor application.

Although we are not expecting any problems to arise, please let me know of any issues your group has logging onto the system.  Thank you for your help!

Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

At some point I would recommend setting up a mailbox for your new controls group.  That way we won't have to worry about who is doing what, everyone in the group will get it.  The current controls group did that and it was much easier.

I tried to breakout the curves for Keith and Frank in the file you are working on but we should run that by them for approval.  Mike will be setting all gas daily and physical curves.  I think we can combine basis, index and GDI curves into one file per trader leaving only three curve files to load.
 
Let me know what you think.  Once we get their ok on the curves, we can set them up and let them add any formulas they need, especially Mikes file.

Mike,

We will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent Jeff earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.

We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.    

Thanks
Kam

Kam, 

Yes, I can set up the new books if you can provide me the book short names and book codes.  But the book needs to be first set up in Global then I can set it up in Tagg/Erms.  Contact Cheryl Johnson to set up new books in Global.  Once she completed then I can finish the rest.

Call me if you have any questions.

Cecilia,

We need to get some new books set up in ERMS this week for Netco.  We will be taking over this responsibility from the controls group but they are reluctant to grant us access to RisktRAC now due to security reasons.  These books are needed for many downstream groups and therefore must be set up soon.  Can you set these up before they are in risktrac this time due to these limitations?  I can give you the book and portfolio codes and the TAGG short names.

Please let me know today so we can start ASAP.

Thanks

Kam

Risk groups:

Also, I wanted to let the risk groups know that I met with E&Y yesterday and they noted some items they would like to follow up on.  I've asked them to contact you directly.  Lastly, the form A's prepared were not consistent in regards to the treatment of intercompanies.  E&Y needs the 11/30 form A's without intercompanies.  For those of you who provided Form A's with intercompanies, please break them out and send us a second form.

Thanks

Shona,

Thanks for the Form A update meeting yesterday.  Here is a more formal
request for the follow-up items we mentioned.  If you could help point us
in the right direction to obtain this information, it would be appreciated.

1)We would like to review the results for a sample of queries for the Form
A's (whether these are reports generated or the output resulting from the
below queries).

Commodity:  Natural Gas

Transaction Distribution by MTM (#): >=$0mm, <$1mm
Tenor Distribution by MTM ($): >=3 years, <5 years

Commodity:  Electricity

Tenor Distribution by Transactions (#):  <1 year
Trade Type  Distribution by Transactions (#):  Forward
Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Forward

Commodity:  Eastern Coal

Tenor Distribution by MTM ($):  >=5 year, <10 years

Commodity:  C3

Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Swap

All queries are for both financial net and physical net values.

2)As a second follow-up, we would like a description and sample contract
of each product type (for the largest positive MTM within each category),
as defined by each commodity (this is item 8 on our comprehensive request
list)

3) A confirmation for the longest deal for each commodity (also related to
item 8 in our request list)

4)For each commodity other than power and gas (which will be outlined in
separate lists), we would like confirmations for the 10 (or all if fewer
than 10) largest (starting with highest positive MTM) transactions
regardless of termination status (this is item 21d on our comprehensive
request list)


I will try to follow-up with a visit or phone call.

Regards,
Scott

Susan,

These are book requests for the Netco books for all regions.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  We put in some book and portfolio codes we would like if they are available.  If not, please call me.  We need all price, basis, index, and gas daily US books to be the same, all Canadian books to be the same and all physical books to have the same codes please.

Thanks

Kam, 

Ramesh said it was fine to add these three trading locations to the list.

The enrties will have to be inserted into the range in the "Field Constraints" spreadsheet tab.
I think the dropdowns will automatically update.

If not, please let me know, I can modify the sheet and send out a new version.  Thanks!

Kristen,

Attached are all live financial deals by risk type.  As you can see, the price data is too large to fit into one tab.  

After tomorrow, I will no longer have access to the estate files.  Greg Couch will be taking over the responsibility for the estate risk group and will be able to assist you with your requests going forward.  


Thanks

Kam

There is a file under Netco for all currently unused books, rolls and hedge strips.  O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books.  Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed.  The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated.  

There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files. 

We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website.  Let's try to keep these the same format.  East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift.  West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that. 

I believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then.

All deals have been moved to ENA-IM WEST last night.  Set up your physical post-id's for today and calculate the weapon-X, make sure there are no deals in your books using a forwards detail.  If it is blank, you can run your weapon-X and input into your P&L this morning, you will also need to officialize your physical book one last time.  

Financial - you don't need to roll your p&l anymore, (except for Monte, you will have to due to the transport model).
Go into the RAC website and inactivate all of your books other than the physical, you will do that tomorrow.

Now that all tagg deals are in one book, we will be splitting up the alphabet among all groups to help monitor that the correct counterparties are being moved to the Bankuptcy book.  We will get with you all later regarding that.


Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Attached is a spreadsheet representing additional Counterparties who have terminated their relationship with ENA.  There aren't enough deals to involve IT, so can you please have your Risk groups move the attached deals to the Bankruptcy books.

I brought some of my natural gas and options books from home.  Please come by my desk if you want to read one during the day or make copies of some chapters to take home with you.

Thanks

John,

Are you ready to learn your first control function.  The controls group is going to let us set up the new books we need for Netco today.  When you are ready let me know and we'll go down there, or they will come up here or whatever.

Susan,

These are book requests for the Netco books for all regions.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  We put in some book and portfolio codes we would like if they are available.  If not, please call me.  We need all price, basis, index, and gas daily US books to be the same, all Canadian books to be the same and all physical books to have the same codes please.

Thanks

Kam

We have already created gas books for the top half of the list.  We now need to attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types)to these books.  Also, we need to create gas books for the bottom half of the list, as well as, attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types).

Thank you.

Greg,

There are still about 2,000 deals between ECC and Riskmantra that need to be moved to the Bankruptcy books.  IT did all ECC to ENA deals, they need to change the script to ECC and Riskmantra.  We started to move some of the deals manually but there are too many to do.  Sanjeev Gupta has been doing this for us in the past.   I left a message with him but you might want someone to follow up with him to make sure it happens before calcing time today.


Here is a list of the deals if you guys are looking for work to do.

 
Thanks

Yes,

The first three legs are the purchase for 80,000/d.  Leg 4 is the annuity, and leg 5 is the put.

I don't think I know what you are asking.

See attached Summary Sheet, they all seem to be the same Tagg #'s with different legs.

It looks like legs 1,2,3 are part of the Purchase, while the other legs are part of the Resid Swap.

Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

Kyle

Carl,

The attached spreadsheet will show you the MTM value for all gas deals with TXU Energy Trading Company as of Nov-30.
Please see the PBI tab for Price, Basis and Index and the GD Options tab for options.

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

You will have access soon - Stephanie will send you your ID's and passwords.

We have a lot of work to do in there - so we don't want everyone in there quite yet.  The problem is - if traders are playing with the products while we are trying to re-build the products and data elements with UBS names - we are going to have issues.

The other thing I want to make sure everyone understands - this is our new production data base - not a test data base.  
There are a limited number of authorized users assigned to "testing" or playing around with the data - and they are responsible for cleaning it up too.   
We will allow people to play for the simulation only.

Once we finish building our UBS production data base - we will the copy it to our test data base - and resume our bridge testing from there to the other test environments (our test environment still has the old Enron data).

Same for commodity Crude, Unleaded, and Heating Oil (the future & options books for these 3 commodities could be the same and could be different.  But currently you only have 1 book set up for each of these 3 commodities).

Kam,
 
Here's an example of the file we use to reconcile one book from the DPR to G/L.  If you need me to walk someone through this, just let me know.

Phillip,

I tried to breakout the curves that Keith and Frank will be setting in the file you have been working in.  We probably should run these past them to make sure

Two people will be setting curves for basis.  Keith Holst for CA curves and Frank Ermis for Rockies and Southwest curves. I will be setting curves for balance of the month.

Thanks,

Mike,

We will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent Jeff earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.

We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.    

Thanks
Kam

Russell,
I believe that Francis Lim has been trying to help you with the project we have been talking about.  The information below should be able to replace what he may have given you.  You can copy these post-id's and change the dates to whatever you like. 

Here are all of the post-id's for the PG, G1 and W9 which are the remaining live books.

price			1458677
basis 			1458682
index 			1458681
gas daily		1458683	
gas daily index		1458681
canadian price		1458639
canadian GD		1458283


These are the bankruptcy post-id's (HH and HE)

price			1459387
basis 			1459389			
index 			1459391	
gas daily		1459392	
gas daily index		1459393
canadian price		1459395
canadian GD		1459396


Attached are the forwards and options details that you can run to give you all of the values you may need.

   

Let me know if you have any questions.

We will have to change the org_region codes for all of our books today.  I will send you the updated book requests today once IT has agreed to the changes.  That should solve your problem.

Jeff,

I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco.  As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, "MF".  When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region.  When we pull the "MF" book code with "Financial" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc.  We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.  I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.  Do you know of another field that would provide this information?

thanks

It is saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\Controls\Trader Matrix.xls

Please add any other fields you think we should have.  Jeff mentioned he wants to be able to quickly tell what books belong to what traders, O'neil had this idea.
Is everyone ready to start setting up their books today?  Has Scott Neal gotten back to you yet Phillip?

Also, all physical weapon-X tabs are linking to an old east book.  I didn't touch that tab yet, we don't know if we're using weapon-X or sasqwatch.

Hey Gang,

Just a heads up, but you may need to edit your Copy Physical Macro in your P&L's that are saved in the Netco/Regions folder... The changes were simply renaming sheets in the Macro... O

FYI......

We are not bringing in prompt month value tonight.  Texas did, about $25,000.  The other regions don't have what we need for demand charges, etc. and no one has taken any time to research the values yet.  The other groups we need have been gone for hours.  We have some large positions which I don't really think are right.  I'll look closer in the morning.  

Hope you feel better soon, at least you have all weekend to recover.

See you Monday,

Kam

Cheryl,

The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.


Thanks,

I put in a book request for the canada books two days ago.  I will check with John Valdes to see what the hold up is.  As far as the futures and options books, there should be one book for both.  If you have questions about that can you please call Errol McLaughlin directly?  Those are his books and I don't know how they need to be set up.

Thanks

Kam,

I will update the regions for the books.  Also please advise which gas book is for future and which one is for the options.  Same for commodity Crude, Unleaded, and Heating Oil (the future & options books for these 3 commodities could be the same and could be different.  But currently you only have 1 book set up for each of these 3 commodities).

Ryan,
 
Everyone else is going to be here on Monday so please feel to stay a few extra days.  We will have the normal closing stuff, (liquidations, PMA's, etc.)  I've already checked out our PMA's and we don't have anything to liquidate so it should be a piece of cake.  Things may pick up a little bit on Wednesday getting the books closed for the year.
See you then
 
Have a great weekend,
 
Kam

I don't have any contacts at Duke.  Kelly Little will be working there, but other than that I don't know anyone.  Have you called Scott Neal back yet?  We were just talking about that exact thing, we knew all the weather guys left and were wondering what they would do.  That would be a great opportunity for you.

Hi Kam,

I have already applied there online last week but I am afraid that it may have gone into that great HR black hole. Thank you for the heads up, though.  Do you have any contacts there?  Scott Neal has been trying to get a hold of me.  UBS is looking for some weather guys because a bunch of weather people left there.  Now wouldn't that be funny if I ended up back there in a different capacity?

These are book requests for the Netco books for all regions.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  We put in some book and portfolio codes we would like if they are available.  If not, please call me.  We need all price, basis, index, and gas daily US books to be the same, all Canadian books to be the same and all physical books to have the same codes please.

Can I get your help on the following request?  We need to find out what receivables/payables for financial and physical deals we have outstanding with the attached counterparties that we don't plan on settling.  

Can you please let me know if you are the right people to do this and how long it would take to get this information together?

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

Kristen,

Once Zhiyong gets me the information, how would you like this handled?  Do you want me to fill out the Schedule A, or would you rather have pivot tables similar to Todd Hall's for each scenario?

Kelly will be a power trader.  I don't know if she has any experience doing that.  
I haven't heard exactly why the weather group left, but many of the traders weren't happy that the move was a lateral one and didn't accept their offers.  I think that's what happened with them.  
Good luck with everything, it would be great to work with you again.

KK

Is Kelly doing structuring over there or is it a risk job? Any details on the weather guy(s) walkout?  Sounds like a good opportunity but why did they all leave?  I wonder if they're starting up their own consulting company? I have a few things presently in the works. I'm hoping to touch base with Scott N. sometime today. Too bad I couldn't make a living by being a frequent job switcher.  I could be good at that.  Things would be a hell of a lot easier if I was willing to take a job out of state.  Lots available elsewhere..

See ya,

JR

Scott Neal has been trying to get a hold of me.  UBS is looking for some weather guys because a bunch of weather people left there.  Now wouldn't that be funny if I ended up back there in a different capacity?

Kam,

I found the following comment in Global Counterparty regarding the suspension of TXU Energy Trading Company (CP ID 69034):

 

Cheryl Johnson in the GCP group suspended this record due to the merger which resulted in the final name of TXU Energy Trading Company LP.  It sounds like deals need to be moved over to the new CP name.  You will need to coordinate that with Cheryl because she will have to re-activate the CP ID to do that.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

These deals have been corrected.  The triggers and demand charges have been removed.  Deal #1005851 did have gas flow and I believe should still be settled unless someone says otherwise.

Thanks

I am reviewing the accrual, and have found a number of deals so far that look like they were terminated, but the demand charges/triggers are still in Sitara.  Should these be zeroed out as well, or are we really supposed to bill them?  I haven't made it through the whole list, but here's what I've seen so far that I'm questioning.  Please let me know today if possible.  Also, if I've left anyone off that needs to see this, please let me know.  Thanks.

Kam - I've had the coordinators go through all of the terminated counterparties, and here is another list of deals we are questioning.  Can Risk review the deals that are demand charges/triggers and either verify their validity or zero them out?  I'm meeting with Logistics this afternoon to review the deals that flowed past the termination dates to ensure that they are correct.  This needs to be done today if possible, as we will have to run the accrual on Monday.  Thanks.

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

FYI - the west is wanting to split the region into two regions.  Stephen, I know you have been working on mapping the P&Ls for reporting purpose, the attached file breaks down those two regions.  We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Torrey,

Here are the new mappings for the EOL products, except for the central desk.  Hunter is still working on his but I wanted to get you something.

for physical rest of month deals we attached the physical book id
for prompt month physical deals we attached the TAGG book id

is that correct?


I will send the finished product when Hunter is done.  Keep in mind it will probably change again.

Bob,

Here are all active in-the-money trades in our books as of last night.
The summary tab gives you the deal count and MTM value by month, the next tab breaks the value down by counterparty if needed.
I already sent this to Kristen. 


 
Here are the performance deals as well, James may have already sent this to you...

 
Let me know if there is anything I left out.

Scott,

Can you check the contract on #500282.  The chicago office needed to add a month to this deal and it wouldn't let it due to the contract #.  I changed it but probably shouldn't have.  It probably needs a new ticket.  Let me know.


Kay in Chicago needed this at 312-541-1235

Thanks

Kam

Zhiyong,

These are the post-id's that we have pulled.  Showna and Debbie Brackett are trying to get the official post-id's from the system.  Once they get that, I will check them against these.  It is very possible that these won't be all of the correct id's but I wanted to get you something to start on.

Thanks

James,

Could you go back to the detail we used to do the form A, there is also a cross commodity file that needs to be added, and remove all intercompany deals and redo.  Let me check it once you have all of those deals isolated, just to check over the names once again.

Thanks

Risk groups:

Also, I wanted to let the risk groups know that I met with E&Y yesterday and they noted some items they would like to follow up on.  I've asked them to contact you directly.  Lastly, the form A's prepared were not consistent in regards to the treatment of intercompanies.  E&Y needs the 11/30 form A's without intercompanies.  For those of you who provided Form A's with intercompanies, please break them out and send us a second form.

Thanks

Shona,

Thanks for the Form A update meeting yesterday.  Here is a more formal
request for the follow-up items we mentioned.  If you could help point us
in the right direction to obtain this information, it would be appreciated.

1)We would like to review the results for a sample of queries for the Form
A's (whether these are reports generated or the output resulting from the
below queries).

Commodity:  Natural Gas

Transaction Distribution by MTM (#): >=$0mm, <$1mm
Tenor Distribution by MTM ($): >=3 years, <5 years

Commodity:  Electricity

Tenor Distribution by Transactions (#):  <1 year
Trade Type  Distribution by Transactions (#):  Forward
Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Forward

Commodity:  Eastern Coal

Tenor Distribution by MTM ($):  >=5 year, <10 years

Commodity:  C3

Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Swap

All queries are for both financial net and physical net values.

2)As a second follow-up, we would like a description and sample contract
of each product type (for the largest positive MTM within each category),
as defined by each commodity (this is item 8 on our comprehensive request
list)

3) A confirmation for the longest deal for each commodity (also related to
item 8 in our request list)

4)For each commodity other than power and gas (which will be outlined in
separate lists), we would like confirmations for the 10 (or all if fewer
than 10) largest (starting with highest positive MTM) transactions
regardless of termination status (this is item 21d on our comprehensive
request list)


I will try to follow-up with a visit or phone call.

Regards,
Scott

Cheryl,

Thanks for taking care of these so quickly.

I have reattached the central book request with some additional books.  The blue highlighted "Cent" books were on the original request but were labeled as "FB" and should have been PB as the book name.  I assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it.  Is that correct?
I corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom.

Thanks again,

Kam

The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

The sitara mapping table is saved in the Netco file named CurveMappings.xls

Check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore, make a list of those and what the new mappings should be.  Once the new database is set up we will get with Russ to have those changed over.

Debbie,

Have you had any luck getting the Nov. 30th post id's? I did my best job trying to get them for Houston, Chicago and Calgary but with over 400 post-id's I guarantee that we missed some.

Let me know if you still think it's possible, I would like to get back to Zhiyong today.

Thanks again for your help,

Kam

Z,

We have been making lists of the directories that need to be moved over with Netco.  Will these directories be moved so that the estate can't use them, or will copies be made so both groups could use the files?  If not, we will have to make copies and change the list we have put together already.


Thanks

Please let anyone else who used those files know to start saving them to the new files starting today.

Kathy,

Vladi asked me to give you a call.  I will be out of the office until about 2:00 today so I wanted to let you know what we did to populate Form A.
We gave all post-id's that were calculated on Nov-30th to Zhiyong Wei.  From there, he dumped all of that information into excel and we formatted it from there into the required buckets.  It will take a few hours for IT to get the file ready to use so I recommend getting that together ASAP.

Let me know what I can do to help.

Thanks

Kam

Suzanne,

I was wondering if you had a chance to research the below note.  Furthermore, please note the updated file attached.  There are no changes volumetrically from the last file, but there are some price differences.  Basically, Coral has taken these deficiency charges in their final settlement with Nov-01 prod.  So, the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges.  Please advise on what you might know about this from a scheduling point of view when possible.

Kam,

We talked briefly about this before the holidays.  The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral.  However, I assume that you need to be in the loop to also verify the overall deficiency charges and ultimately approve the creation of demand charges on the appropriate deals.  Please let me know where you stand on this or what might be my next steps in cleaning this up.

Thanks,

Suzanne,

Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.  The worksheet of concern is titled "Sched".  Each deal is listed by group.  That is to say that they are not listed by day, but the days in question are mentioned for each group.  Furthermore, the volumes on the left of each group are from Coral's data, whereas the right side contains ENA data or my calculations.  Please prioritize these as you can with the expectation that I might be able to work on this upon my return from vacation on Jan 2.

This is a copy of the transport model.  We don't breakout the monthly cash flows but the individual tabs hold all the prices and volumes.  You could use that to get the value you need.

To keep things consistent all of the traders, except the financial group, will use their physical books to log in for EOL.

Kam,

As we discussed this morning, the traders will be using their physical books to log onto EOL with the exception of the financial desk (John Arnold and team).  Behind the scenes, EOL will  set these traders up in the Counterparty Alternates table to have the books "flip" to the respective financial book when a financial trade is hit.  

Also, any word yet on the traders wanting a different book for price, basis and index.  We are still under the assumption that the trades will book under one book.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Dawn

The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books.

All -
 
Starting Wednesday, we all have lots of work to do to get the new company up and running on time.  Going forward,  we need to be a proactive organization as opposed to a reactive organization.  Given that we have the best people in the organization going over, this should not be difficult to accomplish.
 
Let me be very clear.  Playing on the internet will not be tolerated.  There is too much that has to get done over the next two weeks.  That message needs to be communicated to everyone going to the new company.  If people feel like they do not have anything to do,  they should be reading about options or the gas business.  This is a great opportunity for people to make themselves better employees.  I have no problem changing the lists if someone steps up,  or if someone doesn't.  
 
Below,  are a few things I need your help with over the next few days.

(i)    Budget (due Jan 2, 2002)                                                 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 

Each of you needs to draw up a budget for your region by the end of the day Wednesday.  Use the format that we used for the Enron 2002 Budget process.  Russ and Greg.  You will be one cost center in the new organization.

John,  can you be responsible for coordinating this and compiling all budgets into one by Wednesday night?




(ii)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 3)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     

I need to detailed plans for what files we are moving,  the systems we need,  and anything that will make the move better for the business.

Kam - Can you coordinate and give me the list be Thursday evening?

(iii)   Seating Plans                                                   Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

If you have any preferences in this area let me know ASAP, so that I can make requests now.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Just so you know, there will be more people in this week.

Please let me know how I can help in getting everything done.  I look forward to a great year working with all of you.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

 

Jeff

Kam,

I'm trying to draft over a volume but can't get it to because the referenced index does not have any values in the table.  Can I get you to change the index on deal 605991 to NWPL.STANFIELD.GDP.D.A (from NWPL.STANFIELD.GD.M.I.).  I need the $6.32 price on the 8th.

I don't know who has been saving these daily.  Can you tell whoever on the west desk to use the new file instead.  They are for the estate and need to keep them away from the Netco files.

Can I get your help on the following request?  We need to find out what receivables/payables for financial and physical deals we have outstanding with the attached counterparties that we don't plan on settling.  

Can you please let me know if you are the right people to do this and how long it would take to get this information together?

Thanks

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

Good question,

I think we should have an excel template set up with all imaginable necessary info that all traders should use, one line per trade rather than one sheet per trade.  What do you think?

This request is saved in O:\_dropbox\Kam\In-the-money trades\Summary.xls.  The file is too large to attach. 
It reflects all active in-the-money trades in our books as of last night. 

The summary tab gives you the total deal count and MTM value by month.  The next tab will break out the value by counterparty by month.

Please let me know if this is everything you need.

We have a copy of the p&l format we will all be using saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\blank P&L.xls.  If you are setting up your formulas you can use this format to create all your links for the new NGP&L and then change them to the individual p&l's later, we will be deciding how to break out the traders sometime this week.   

Attached is a list of the book names and the traders associated with each book.

 
Let me know what you guys need to get all of this set up this week.

We have decided to name our books FB-West1 thru 10......for each region

We will have a matrix saved for everyone to be able to look at with the book names, trader names, sitara books, P&L file name, global id, and everything else that anyone might want to see.  I think this will make things more consistent than coming up with new stupid names like before.  All books, including the financial books, will have the same portfolio and book codes.  Physical books will be seperate but will all be the same.

Subject:	Netco(UBSWenergy) Excel Conversions

Hello again,

We need to convert DSN references in more excel spreadsheets... this time to be used by NetCo(UBSWenergy).   The location of these files begins here: O:\erms\erms_adm\NetCo  including all sub-folders.  Convert excel files(.xls) only.  After you convert a spreadsheet move it to your current folder's "_Converted" folder.

Before you start, please run both the "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT" and "ODBC DSN Entries for RMS" scripts.  These can be found by going thru the menus "Start", "Programs","System Utility Applications", then "Installation & Diskette Creation".  Afterwards you should see the new DSN's by running your windows "Data Sources (ODBC)" program and looking on the "System DSN" tab.  

Note that the DSN's using Oracle drivers now are followed by "-ora" and the DSN's without "-ora" were previously reserved for use with Microsoft (for oracle) drivers.

Remember, after opening an excel to convert, type [Alt]-[F11] to get to the VBA code.  Then type [Ctrl]-[F] and type "dsn" in the "Find What" field.  Make sure the "Search" selection is on "Current Project".  Keep pressing [Find Next] until you have addressed all dsn references.

The goal is to change all old dsn references to point to the new Netco(UBSWenergy) databases.  For example egsprod will become "ermtp-ora".   Do NOT put "est" in front of these dsn's because that will point to the old ESTate versions of the database!

ERMS Examples:

Example 1: This is the most common type of change.
Original: 
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")


Example 2:
Original 
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;DBQ=ermt;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;DBQ=ermtp;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)




Example 3: In this example note that the DSN is referencing the variable "DBase" which points to cell B3 (see print-screen below)
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=" & DBase & ";UID=" & UserName & ";PWD=" & Password

Originally:
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Should be changed to:
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 



Example 4: RMS Example

Tracey,

We will have to change the org_region codes for all of our books today.  I will send you the updated book requests today once IT has agreed to the changes.  That should solve your problem.

Thanks

Jeff,

I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco.  As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, "MF".  When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region.  When we pull the "MF" book code with "Financial" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc.  We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.  I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.  Do you know of another field that would provide this information?

thanks

Errol,

Torrey sent us a file with all of the EOL products and the old book assignments.  He need us to tell him the new trader name, book name and global ID today. 

The file is saved in Netco\controls\Trader-Book template (US gas)_EOL new books.xls

the global ID's are saved in your book request also in the controls file

FYI - the west is wanting to split the region into two regions.  Stephen, I know you have been working on mapping the P&Ls for reporting purpose, the attached file breaks down those two regions.  We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

OK, the fun continues.

We need to assign EOL products to traders.  Torrey sent a file (Netco\controls\Trader-Book template (US Gas)_EOL new books) with all products and the old book assignments.  We need to get with the traders today and get these split out.....many will stay the same as before.  

Also, when physical deals are done, will all risk types go to the same desk or will one person be managing the index separately.  ex. the west desk used to book all index to Grigsby's book.  I have told Dawn that all risk types will go to that trader's book but if index needs to be changed let me know.

Amanda,

Can you please look at the last line for Management West?  Those deals are booked to the FT-CAND-EGSC book in Canada.  It wasn't reflected in our P&L's, it also didn't liquidate so it shouldn't be a variance.

Thanks

Kam

Hi!

First, I would like to say thanks for clearing so many variances last month.  It was greatly appreciated!  Here are the variances between the Risk P&L and the GL as of November 30.  Let me know if you have any questions.  FYI - I will be out of the office until December 31.

Brian,

In an effort to keep things consistent at UBS we have tried to perfect a roll spreadsheet that all regions should use.  We added extra rolls so we should never have to add rolls.  We have saved copies for our new P&L's in O:erms\erms_adm\netco\2002\0102\Regions0102 (this will be out new regions file until further notice.  

Can you copy one of those files and use that as your new P&L's?  Let me know if you see a problem in doing that.  We are trying to start linking up all new P&L's to the DPR, can you save yours out to that file when you are ready.  


Thanks

Kam

Subject:	Questionable Deals

I am reviewing the accrual, and have found a number of deals so far that look like they were terminated, but the demand charges/triggers are still in Sitara.  Should these be zeroed out as well, or are we really supposed to bill them?  I haven't made it through the whole list, but here's what I've seen so far that I'm questioning.  Please let me know today if possible.  Also, if I've left anyone off that needs to see this, please let me know.  Thanks.

Hello Randy & James,

Below are the forwarded instructions as to how we plan to update the excel dsn's for netco(UBSWenergy).  Only test excels in "_converted" folders, then create/move successful tests to a "_tested" folder (within the corresponding "_converted" folder).  

Call me if you have any prob/questions.

Subject:	Netco(UBSWenergy) Excel Conversions

Hello again,

We need to convert DSN references in more excel spreadsheets... this time to be used by NetCo(UBSWenergy).   The location of these files begins here: O:\erms\erms_adm\NetCo  including all sub-folders.  Convert excel files(.xls) only.  After you convert a spreadsheet move it to your current folder's "_Converted" folder.

Before you start, please run both the "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT" and "ODBC DSN Entries for RMS" scripts.  These can be found by going thru the menus "Start", "Programs","System Utility Applications", then "Installation & Diskette Creation".  Afterwards you should see the new DSN's by running your windows "Data Sources (ODBC)" program and looking on the "System DSN" tab.  

Note that the DSN's using Oracle drivers now are followed by "-ora" and the DSN's without "-ora" were previously reserved for use with Microsoft (for oracle) drivers.

Remember, after opening an excel to convert, type [Alt]-[F11] to get to the VBA code.  Then type [Ctrl]-[F] and type "dsn" in the "Find What" field.  Make sure the "Search" selection is on "Current Project".  Keep pressing [Find Next] until you have addressed all dsn references.

The goal is to change all old dsn references to point to the new Netco(UBSWenergy) databases.  For example egsprod will become "ermtp-ora".   Do NOT put "est" in front of these dsn's because that will point to the old ESTate versions of the database!

ERMS Examples:

Example 1: This is the most common type of change.
Original: 
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")


Example 2:
Original 
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;DBQ=ermt;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;DBQ=ermtp;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)




Example 3: In this example note that the DSN is referencing the variable "DBase" which points to cell B3 (see print-screen below)
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=" & DBase & ";UID=" & UserName & ";PWD=" & Password

Originally:
 

Should be changed to:
 



Example 4: RMS Example

Original:
   .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=New Rms Production;DBQ=tns:rmsprod_ded;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
Should be changed to:
  .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=rmsp-ora;DBQ=tns:rmsp;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)



There are 650+ excel files to convert so we really appreciate all of the help we can get.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks, (very much!)

We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.  I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.  Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

Regarding issue (1) below:

The reason I do not see MP and MD in ermt/estermtp is that the counterparties are not in global
and my script to check joins with tagg_global_cp also.

Since these are physical books with deals flowing from Sitara->CPR, we should be ok.

Jeff,

I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco.  As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, "MF".  When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region.  When we pull the "MF" book code with "Financial" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc.  We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.  I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.  Do you know of another field that would provide this information?

thanks

Scott,  

I really think that Melissa would be able to handle Storey better than Kristen.  I think we should keep her on Central and let you take Kristen on the East.

Are you ok with that?

Kim, 

I am trying to find the exact termination date for the attached counterparties for physical and financial deals.  Can you help me with this?

Kam,

I was just talking to Barry about this and he is saying that the MTM for future deals should be dated the 2nd as well.  Basically, as of the date the contracts terminated, which most were that day (or monday the 3rd).  Sorry.  Let me know if you have any quesitons.

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

Dear Jim & Barry,

We are getting info from gas and power.  We do have an issue with the inception to date P&L (see Chris's memo), and I'm also a bit concerned with the accuracy gas position reported to us of 5500 (short).  We've discussed it with Jeff's group and they have confirmed it, but it still seems a bit big to me.

Well keep working.

Best regards

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. "as normal" - the remainder will be "frozen" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa

Errol,

Here are the bankruptcy post-id's that need to be calculated tonight.  You probably don't have access to the Canadian book so you can get it from Jeremy or use my computer.  The right one has portcalc up, kkeiser & tamu96ddd.

They might need to be on inexact for basis and index.
Once those are done, can you email the id #'s to John Powell, Debbie Brackett and Stephanie McGinnis?

Thanks

Kam

Can we also get the books that these used to be mapped to?  That will eliminate about 75% of the work.
 
Thanks

Hi Kam,
 
As per our phone conversation, I have attached a listing of all the products which are being migrated to EOL NetCo. If Risk could fill in the traders which will be managing each product and the Global Book ID, we will use that data as the basis for an update script to automatically assign the new books to each product. 
 
I'll be in the office early tomorrow if you have any questions, or would like to go over any special book assignments that may need to be covered outside of a mass-update.
 
Thanks,

Hey,

I keep hearing negative things about Lord of the Rings. Any desire to see In
the Bedroom. It's a thriller with Sissy Spacek. I've heard good things about
it. Or The Shipping News with Kevin Spacey. This is a drama. I think I'd
prefer the thriller myself.

In the Bedroom is playing at the Edwards near you at 1:30pm.

What do you think?

Ashely,

I noticed that there isn't a wacog being used in your P&L.  Currently it is taking the UA4 volume and multiplying it by $0, it needs to have a dollar value in cell M83 on the physical tab.

Question:

Once the new database for ERMS is split for Netco. we will have to make some changes to the gas daily curve mapping tables.  Is there another way to create these mappings other than adding them one at a time.  We are getting rid of a large percentage of curves and will be making many changes to the current mappings.  Doing it one by one will be very time consuming and I want to see if you are able to load them another way.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... ( if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

We created the real portfolios of all these books as well. We are waiting on the hierarchy from Risk Controls. If that is delayed, then we will simply dump all the real portfolios under a root portfolio for purposes of testing potential exposure, credit reserve and VaR.

Kam, John, we found a few book_id name issues while trying to batch-load the books.

We were able to figure out the issues ourselves, but for your reference here are the changes we made:


FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	P	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	D	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	I	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	M	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	Y	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	

Note all 5 books were labeled as 'FB-EXECUTIVE'.  We instead named them

FB-EXECUTIVE-PRC
FB-EXECUTIVE-BAS
FB-EXECUTIVE-IDX
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDM
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDY

Also, we found these two books that had the same book ID:

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST1	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST10	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

Note that the second book should be named 'FB-WEST10-GDM', based on the WEST10 Region Code.

We fixed that one as well.

Please update your spreadsheet, and let us know if we need to discuss in the morning.

The next step is the hierarchy, which we should receive from Stephanie or Debbie in the morning.  Thanks.

Andrew

No Denver region.  The book was named after the office.  We can change the name and it will be a part of the west.

Mike,

Will there be a Denver region for Netco?  I have assumed that everything will be considered West but want to make sure before we set up the books.

Thanks

We would like to change the Netco directory name to UBS.

We will have to change the links to the NGP&L and anything else that links to files in Netco.  Let me know this morning if that will be a major problem for anyone.

Hey,

Phillip already made reservations and Jeff is waiting to make sure he can go.  Darren and his wife have made their plans, and Dawn and Gary have also, I think.  I will next week, and a couple other girls from risk are going too.  We're leaving on the 13th, returning the 16th.  Staying at the Mirage. 

You could win thousands in Vegas to use for your house.  What other vacation can do that.

Well, we think we should hear something today as far as who we work for now.  I'm sure it will be next week though.  We're assuming it will happen and have been setting up all new files and databases.  It should be interesting.

How is your job?  Does Kyle Lilly work for you now?

Later,
Kam

Maybe so, I'm guessing that is during Spring Break again?  Not too sure if
I really liked it with that many people out there, too many high dollar
tables.  Have you guys already made reservations?  Give me a little more
info but I kind have been saving for the house.  It should be ready around
late March or early April and I know I will have to buy a lot of stuff for
that, like a kegorator you know important things.

So what's the latest at Big E or I guess Little E now.  You think you guys
will go to the new joint venture or what ever happens to the trading
company when they sell it off?  Have you been looking?

Keep me in the loop.

Kyle

Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

Kyle

We will probably be loading these on Wednesday for the first time to do our final testing so let me know if you have any questions or need our help with this. 

Can you let me know when you have finished with yours so we can convert them to the new database?

Thanks

Kam


If you have already done this let me know, Phillip is out all week and I don't know where he left off.

This is what we have to look forward to.  We need to get all post-id's, for the live and bankruptcy books, and get those to Sanjeev Gupta to dump into excel.  Then try to tie those MTM values back to the Gross Book Balance we reported on the final NGP&L.  Once that ties, we will format the info to fit schedule B.

You can't wait, right?

These are the official post-id's from Dec 31st for all live deals. We didn't have a "performance" book until January.   I included Canada and EMW at the bottom if needed.

Do y'all know when the books will be final for December - I had hopes of being able to utilize the people going to UBS, so if you can give me a status I would appreciate it.

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. "as normal" - the remainder will be "frozen" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa

FYI........

We will probably have some changes to the trader matrix, we have had some traders quit or decide to stay with the estate.  Once we know for sure, we will send you the new breakout.

Torrey,

I added two columns to the right showing what the curve is now and what it should be.  We made some changes to the curve names to make them consistent.

Let me know if you need anything from me to make these changes.

Thanks

Since you need this as of the 31st, we will have to get Zhiyong the post-id's after we calc. on Thursday and should have this ready to go early next week.

Is that early enough?

There is a new directory for the curve files.  I am trying to request access to this for the traders so they can't see the rest of our files.

This should be done soon.

Can you move your files to this drive today?

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

Luchas,

We didn't run any reports daily for anyone.  There is the DPR that needs to be updated and sent to Showna twice a week that Thomas is doing, Bankruptcy books calculated and post-id's sent to credit daily, and broker quotes need to be saved daily.

Other than that, we were doing mini-books or other requests as they came.

Kam,

I need your help on something.   I am trying to compile a listing of all reports that were being run by the Risk leads and Specialist on a daily basis for the estate.  If you could please give me a general idea of the daily reports that you know of, I would greatly appreciate it.  I am doing this to ensure that we don't skip  or miss anything that was being done on a day to day basis for the estate.  I will take what info you give me and forward it on to Greg Couch so that he will be aware of all reports that needs to be ran daily.  

Thanks
Luchas

To all,  we are compiling a list of all common data ( documents, excel spreadsheets, etc...) contained on our O:drive and M:drive infrastructure that will be required for NetCo.  The assumption is that no transactional deal type data will be migrated. Please forward any directory names that will be required for Netco to me. For example,  O:\common\directoryname etc......If there are additional people or resources that I can coordinate with please let me know.  I am available to meet and assist in anyway possible.

Susan,

Can I please get a copy of the physical  Portfolio Request form from you so in the future we get these physical books set up correctly.
Could you also tell me what needs to be done differently from all other books.  

We created our own Data Codes and sent them to global counterparties, is there anything else different?

KK

also, can you tell me when the PERFORMANCE book will be ready.  Ed McMicheal needs to value those deals today.

Cecilia,

We need to get some new books set up in ERMS this week for Netco.  We will be taking over this responsibility from the controls group but they are reluctant to grant us access to RisktRAC now due to security reasons.  These books are needed for many downstream groups and therefore must be set up soon.  Can you set these up before they are in risktrac this time due to these limitations?  I can give you the book and portfolio codes and the TAGG short names.

Please let me know today so we can start ASAP.

Thanks

Kam

	FT US CAN
	FT Canada
	FT Ontario (Canadian)
	FT Intra Ontario

I know that you may not run all these books, but could you help me find the applicable people so that we may obtain the same information that you provided to us on the Bankruptcy book.

Scott,

I put some question marks next to Brad, John, Pete and Sandra's products.  You have them down as managing some physical products.  Will they be managing those physical books?
If not, they should go to the physical trader managing that location as before. 

Can you take a look at those?

Chance,

We need to prepare the morning reports for the last day of the year.  Biliana isn't here today, could you please take care of that today for her?

Thanks

Kam

Russ,

I want everyone in risk to have access to all regions.  Traders should only have access to their own.

Thanks

KK

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Mark,

Attached are a few examples of the broker quotes we get daily for each region.  I believe you had requested some curves so I also have the curves that were published for November 30th ready for you.  The files may be too large to send so please let me know if this is something you did request and I will get it to you.  

Thanks

Hope this works.

John,
 
I was just thinking about the December liquidations.  We moved many deals over to a book called Bankruptcy for december forward production months.  We won't be calculating this book but I'm wondering if the deals will still liquidate for Jim's (or whoever) schedule.  If they do, we will have huge OA because we killed the swaps on those physical deals, meaning the desk and customer prices will be the same.  We'll see those variances, and at the same time Financial acct. should see a variance because the deals liquidated but were not "flashed" in our P&L's.
 
How can we tell if that book will liquidate this month or not?
 
KK
