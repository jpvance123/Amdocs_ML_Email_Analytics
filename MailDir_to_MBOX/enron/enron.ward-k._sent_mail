Linda,

Here is my very short list for the tournament.  My friend Melissa Reese has said she will volunteer.  Gas has been so crazy over the past week - I have been extremely busy!  Sorry I am so late.  I will continue to add or fill in blanks until you tell me I can't any more.  I have been asked if there is room for sponsors - I said yes to sponsoring teams. 

I will also try to gather trinkets as I get a chance. 

Keep in touch -

thanks,

Kim

Chris,

I didn't make that many changes and I didn't change the ENA profit section.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I will be on my cell phone after 4:00 p.m. here - going to opening day at Enron Field!!  

Here it is - and I will have a copy and be able to discuss with you when you are ready.  Most of the desk is gone.

Thanks,

Kim

Dan,

An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple noti=
ces.  PG&E can confiscate gas if a scheduling party is not in compliance.  =
The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for Emergency flow or=
der.

Thanks,

Kim

we should get financials from Knauf friday morning in the over night mail - I will keep you posted.  I think we can get this deal.  Also, we are three more deals and $100,000 closer to Pebble Beach - I sold gas to Palo Alto yesterday.

How are things coming with Willis Bennett's customers?

Kim,
	The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to include any of the above concepts in the offer.

Dan,

Attached is some language that we are considering for a deal.  Could you take a look at is and give me the "legal" ok on it?  Or add to or Change it so that we are legally comfortable with it?

Thanks,

I appreciate your travel agency services!!

I hope all is well and to see you soon.

I have set up a meeting to discuss invoicing for City of Pasadena for February production going forward. Tori Kuykendall is no longer
involved in that deal and will no longer be invoicing. Kim Ward will explain the structure of the deal to all of us and it is my goal that
the traders will not be involved in creating invoices. Let me know if you will be unable to attend. Thanks.

I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable.  

Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat.

I will keep you posted -

Chris,

Attached is a new spreadsheet with the PG&E, Large Packages Gas Daily prices.  This price is for the PG&E topock point.  It is VERY illiquid.  The desk is going to start posting prices for it on EOL in order to add more liquidity.  As you can see, there are days where there were no prices published for this point in Gas Daily.

As for Griffith, maybe PG&E topock should be the benchmark because Citizens truly doesn't have an alternative market.  Although they can change their primary delivery point to the border, the fact is that it probobly wouldn't flow because the line is already full.  Where can Citizens actually (not theoretically) extract the greatest value for this capacity?  I disagree with Griffiths comment that this price is more reflective of the market - what market?  Very little has traded there in the past.

One issue that we/Citizens needs to think about is hedging capabilities to PG&E topock.  I know when we were talking to them about our capacity, we priced it based on the SJ/Socal spread and they were agreeable to that.  But then again, we could actually flow gas to the border.

Sorry for rambling -

Guys,

Attached is the latest and greatest term sheet for April through August, 2001.  Please let me know if I have addressed all of the issues we discussed.  If not, just let me know and I can fix it.   

Also, for your KRS supply for April 1 -10, we are a Gas Daily minus $.50 bid.  For the 3500 fixed priced gas at the Border, we will pay Gas Daily minus $.10.  Also, for the EPNG capacity delivered to PG&E Topock, our fixed price bid is $2.10 plus variable.

Let me know what you think about these prices so I can get them in the system if we agree.  Also, call me if you have any questions!

Thanks,

Kim

Subject: Kids: Gotta love them!!



Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more about relationships than some adults. 

What do most people do on a date? 

Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.

--Lynette, age 8 

On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10

What would you do if a date was not working  out?  

I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age   

When is it okay to kiss someone? 

When they're rich. --Pam,age 7 

The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that.  
--Curt, age   

The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8

How would the world be different if people weren't  married? 

There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8 

What is the right age to get married?  

No age is good to get married at.  You got to be  a fool to get married.  --Freddie, age 6 

Is it better to be single or married?  

It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys.  Boys need someone to clean up after them.  
--Anita, age 9 

I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.  I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8

How do you decide who to marry? 

You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10

How can a stranger tell if two people are  married? 

You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8 

What do your mom and dad have in  common? 

Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age   

How would you make a marriage work?  

Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10

Hi Manny & Jack,

Attached is our draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Once we get the ISDA signed and executed we can start on this contract.  It would be good to go ahead and get it in place so that when/if we want to do a physical deal, we won't have to worry about paper.

Did we get you everything that you need to go forward with the ISDA?

I will talk to you next week.  Have a good weekend.

Thanks,

Kim

Congratulations on a healthy new baby!  Tyler is sort of a southern name - I like it!  As for me - I got a call last November to come back and market gas in the west.  I didn't think there was much going on out there but decided to go for it for personal reasons.  got here Jan. 2 and gas had completely blown out in the west.  So far, it seems like it was a good move for me.  

My house in PDX sold in 4 days and I came to Houston between Christmas and New years and found a place here.  Still trying to move in as I can't get anything done during the week!  Just had new blinds put in yesterday.

Let me know if you are ever in town - keep in touch

Kim

Hey you. I didn't know you were in Houston. You are over there on the gas
side?! WOW!! When did that happen?
You always did like Houston didn't you. I bet you are having a great time
doing gas. It is quite a market these days.

I didn't go to Phoenix because I just had a baby boy. Tyler is his name. He
was born March 6th. I have a couple of boys now  they will be just fine if
they take after their daddy.

Other than the new arrival things are pretty much steady in my life. Things
are going very well here at Mirant (quite the new name eh!).

Give me an update on your life - being in Houston and all now.

Talk to you soon


Cheers

Scotty,

Didn't see you in Phoenix last week - I actually was in PHX for meetings
and crashed the power party!  How are things?  Houston is good and gas is
great right now.  Let me know how you are -

Kim

Kim
 
Just wanted to follow up with you.  I have reviewed all  of the data, and brought the power people in on this issue to  assist.
We have placed a call to John Ewing and expect to hear back  today.  It appears that this was all effective April 1, 2001.I do not  believe that John has a choice in running.  It is quite likely that he has  had his opinion heard through the Cogeneration Council.
 
I will let you know, but I would move forward for May  2001.
 
Lynn

Dan,

Most things here look good.  From my term sheet, page 1 under El Paso Capacity, what about selling them San Juan gas?  (B.)  And what about page three, number 8?  Let me know -

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Thanks,

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Kim

Just spoke with Mark Russell.  SRP will be in Houston next week on Wednesday and Thursday and would like to meet to discuss the ISDA with legal and credit.  I told Mark that I was available Wed. and Thurs. morning.  Are you guys available at the same time?

Jay - please call me with your bond rating info so that I can email a draft agreement to SRP.

J. -

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.

Thanks,

Kim

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is
available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.

Jan,

Thanks for the email.  It is amazing what two days out of the office will do to my workload!!  I had two RFPs due yesterday - very busy!  I am going to work on our 'thoeoretical' deal that we discussed on Friday to see if there is anything there.  Hopefully, I can come up with something.  Thanks for the info on that.

Call me any time you want to discuss power - I will be glad to share with you what I know.

Thanks again for spending some time with us and hopefully we can come up with a good structure that is good for both of us!!

Have a good day - 

Kim

Thank both of you for stopping by to visit last Friday.  It was good to see you.
I hope Enron can get some of their "creative juices" going and figure out a way
that the City of Mesa can compliment their gas contract with their electric
needs.   I think there are some opportunities out there.

Kim, two things.  One regarding capacity releasing:  our billing determinant is
14,247 and we can release the difference of this number and what our load will
be.  Sorry, I just had to think about it after the meeting.  Also, regarding
this matter, one must consider the conditions of pre-arranged deals.  There are
some hurdles, but all "doable" once we get our thinking caps on.

Two, I did not realize that you were on the electric side for awhile.  I am in
somewhat of a "learning mode" regarding electric and was wondering if you could
just "jam" with me about the electric side.  I understand the concepts because
of my position on the gas side, but I want to learn the players and some
strategies.  Dave, I think you could teach me a thing or two also.

Let me know.

Jan

I didn't get a fax - but if you didn't put my whole name on it - it won't get to me.  That fax is used by many!!  What is the name of the place you charter through?  I just want to let my friend know that things are in the works!!  Sailing sounds good - we can get Camille to come too.  

Thanks for your help!

Of course I remember you.........did you get the fax I sent yesterday?
Actually looking forward to taking you sailing on my boat!  We usually try
to gather a group and go for the day/evening and stop at the boardwalk after

for chips/margarita's at Cadillac Bar.  Yes, place I charter though does all

the lessons - ASA certified - can get you info or you can pick it up
when we go out on my boat too.

Have a great trip/weekend..........lets talk next week and catch up!

Hey Doug,

How are you?  (Do you remember me - from El Tiempo?)  Just wanted to touch
base with you about sailing lessons.  Although the Austrailia trip sounds
really cool - I don't think I can manage this year.  Also, I did commit to
doing this with one of my friends - can't leave him in the dust!!  Anyway,
can you recommend a good place for lessons in Keemah?  Maybe the place you
are taking your lessons to be an instructor?  I would appreciate any
recommendations!!  Going to AZ tonight - I'm sure I will run into you when
I get back.

Have a great weekend,

Kim Ward

Hi Jeff,

Laird gave me your name and number so that I can pass on notional price information that you asked for.  Let me know anytime you need to see our price indications and I will do what I can to help you.  I know that Laird has worked with you guys extensively.  The prices that he said you were looking at are listed below and are based on PG&E City gate prices:

Q4, 2001                			    $11.70
2 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2003		    $ 6.80
5 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2006		    $ 5.85
Oct. 2001 - Dec. 2003	  		    $ 7.38

I tried to call but it was after hours for you.  Give me a call and let me know where you are with your gas supply negotiations and I will try to pick up where Laird left off.

Regards,

Kim Ward

Bonnie,

Sorry I am just now getting back - I was out of the office Thurs & Fri.  What I am trying to determine is the rate that Long Beach wants to beat and what it is made up of - so I would say both transmission and commodity prices.  Let me know if you have any more questions -

Thanks,

Kim, just a clarification on the last question of your data request --

By historical retail rates vs. SoCal's rates, do you mean the
transmission rates or the commodity prices?

Good morning, 

Hope you had a great Easter weekend. 

Attached are two (2) word files for your review.  First, there is the latest  
draft of the Sales Proposal which reflects the best efforts and intra day  
provisions.  Second, there is the Alternate Nominations provisions.  I spoke  
with PPL this morning and said that I would try to get both of these  
documents to them today.  Your timely review and comments are greatly  
appreciated. 

The Alternate Nominations language is being separately provided at the  
request of PPL so that they can review it.  If they would like to have it  
incorporated, it can easily incorporated into the proposal and/or agreement. 

Chris, I used the working draft of the Enron/Citizens agreement from our  
meeting last Monday in Houston to draft the Alternate Nominations language.   
That draft did not provide for a price differentiation for nominations  
between 8:30 and 9:00 am CPT.  Should there be one? 

Best regard, 

John

Miss Sloney,

When are you coming to Phoenix?  Suzanne gets in at 11:00 p.m. on Friday night and leaves sunday at 1:15.  I leave here wednesday at 6:40 on Southwest from hobby and get there at about 7:25.  I leave sunday at 10:20 a.m. ( I couldn't get a good fair when I bought my ticket for a later time.)  

Let me know what's going on - I hope you can go hike camel back mountain with us!

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully, we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

	One kiss from you, however, and I will turn back into the dapper,

housekeeping in yon castle with my Mother, where you can prepare my meals,
clean my clothes, bear my children, and forever feel grateful and happy

Frank,

I just spoke to Jan Kennedy and they are going out for an RFP for their gas supply once our contract with them runs out.  She "recommended" that I tak e a look at your response to the last RFP because it was so good - far surpassing any of the other responses!!  If you still have a copy or a file of that response, would you mind if I took a look at it? 

thanks,

Kim

Sorry for not leaving a message - I just thought that maybe you would get an email faster.  We ended up leaving Downing a little after midnight.  Not too much later than you.  My weekend was OK.  I am tired of working on my house!  Anyway - went to the baseball game yesterday.  It was nice to be  out in the sun.  Hope your weekend was good.  And now that you have my number - you will have to be the brave one!

Sara,

Salt River Project has attached their Schedule to the Master and their Credit support Annex to this email.  I know we have sent them our docs in the past so I don't know where this will take us.  It doesn't look like they have entered the pertinent credit information into the annex.  Are they expecting us to do this?  Please let me know what you think.  The guy that sent this to me is Mark Russell and his email address is below.

Thanks,

Kim

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is
available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.

Subject: Kids: Gotta love them!!



Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more
about relationships than some adults.

What do most people do on a date?

Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each
other. Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.

--Lynette, age 8

On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets
them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10

What would you do if a date was not working  out?

I'd run home and play dead. --Craig, age

When is it okay to kiss someone?

When they're rich. --Pam,age 7

The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with
that.
--Curt, age

The rules goes like this: If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them
and have kids with them. It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8

How would the world be different if people weren't  married?

There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there? --Kelvin,
age 8

What is the right age to get married?

No age is good to get married at. You got to be  a fool to get married.
--Freddie, age 6

Is it better to be single or married?

It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys. Boys need someone to
clean up after them.
--Anita, age 9

I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going
to have sex with my wife. I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore,
age 8

How do you decide who to marry?

You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff. Like if you like
sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the
chips and dip coming. --Alan, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry.
God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're
stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10

How can a stranger tell if two people are  married?

You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the
same kids. --Derrick, age 8

What do your mom and dad have in  common?

Both don't want any more kids. --Lori, age

How would you make a marriage work?

Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck.
--Ricky, age 10

Chris,

Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that Bonnie sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.

Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.

Have a good weekend -

Kim Ward

Chris,

I can't read these - but my real quesiton is - If the $.07 is a demand charge and Grigsby gets $.04, we should still get the other $.03 because it will be charged on all volumes that CAN be taken, whether they take them or not - right??

Chris,

When you get a chance, I have a couple of questions about this term sheet.  i.e., 8:00 vs 8:30.

Once again, I will be visiting Houston for a brief time.  If for some reason
you have not completely forgotten me, I will be flying in tomorrow night
(Thurs) and going directly to Downing Street/Taco Milagro so that I can hang
with you for a drink (I will get there b/w 9:30pm and 10pm).  Would love to
catch up with you, see how you are and what life is like at a Fortune 7
company.

Hope all is well!

Sara,

I would like to set up a conference call with you and my counterparts at the City of Glendale.  They have some questions regarding some currency language.  Just let me know when you are available and I will set it up with Glendale.  I'm sorry I can't be more clear - I got the information off of a voice message.  Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Ann,

I just spoke with Jay Williams from our credit department and he only needs CalPeak's latest audited financial statements with management notes.  Any additional information that helps us understand the company and how it is set up will be helpful.  Sending this information overnight will probobly be our best bet.  My address is as follows:

1400 Smith Street, EB3206a
Houston, TX  77002

Also, Jay's phone number is 713-345-3923.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

thanks for your help as always.  i think we might try the auberge place.  if
you ever decide to get out of the energy business i think you have a place
as a travel consultant.  You need a break?  you were just in scottsdale.
how drunk was kevin mcmahan that night, i was worried he was going to follow
you up to your room.  i have seen him drunk, but nothing like that....

I can not mention how jealous I am about this trip - but here are some
GREAT recommendations -

1)  Indian Springs in Calistoga, which is just on the north side of the
wineries.  It has a spa and a huge mineral pool.  Also, the rooms are
little bungalows.

2)  A more expensive option - which I havn't tried but comes HIGHLY
recommended - Auberge du Soleil.  It has great rooms, a great spa, and
great food and wine selection.  In fact, you can go to their we page @
www.aubergedusoleil.com.

You can't go wrong with either one.   Also, a restaurant that has been
recommended to me is the Culinary Institute.  It is suppose to be awesome!!

The guys on the gas desk are going to cayman tomarrow - I am very jealous
of that too.  Can you tell I need a break??

Let me know what you think of my suggestions -

Dan, 

El Paso Electric's lawyer is Will Garant and his number is 512-495-8832.  He is the one dealing with our LT contract and is familiar with the collateral issues.  Matt Henry is the lawyer that drafted their long term contract attached.  I can get his number if you need it but I think he works at the same firm as Will.

Let me know what I can do to help and if you have any questions.

Thanks again for your help.

I hope you feel better before your trip to the spa.

Kim,
 
We are very interested in putting in place  an ISDA for weather derivatives, power, and natural gas transactions in regards  to Citizens Communications.  Please get with me as to Enron's interest no  later than Monday, April 23rd.  There is also some opportunity to do  physical power purchase and sales with Citizen's.  It might be worthwhile  for you to set up a meeting with you, me, and the appropriate power guy (Mike  Grigsby?).
 
Hope all is well.
 
Sincerely,

I emailed chuck and told him we would be willing to take cash!!  I also just spoke with Ann Donnelly and she understands that if she wants us there, she will have to come up with something.  She is working on helping us establish the link between united technologies and calpeak as well as provide other info.  I will let you know what they come up with.

Thanks for your quick responses!

Kim -

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is
available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.

Ann,

Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.  As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.

The options presented are not intended to represent a complete list of opportunities, but are representative of the different pricing structures Enron offers.  There are several additional structures available  and we look forward to discussing these options with you.

Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Hey,

Can you send over a list of people you know in this industry,  their companies and maybe their phone numbers?  For my charity golf tournament.  They were due on Tuesday.

Thanks,

Kim

Dan, 

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into the system?

Kim,
	I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
	Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.  
						Dan

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Kim

Subject: Kids: Gotta love them!!



Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more about relationships than some adults. 

What do most people do on a date? 

Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.

--Lynette, age 8 

On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10

What would you do if a date was not working  out?  

I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age   

When is it okay to kiss someone? 

When they're rich. --Pam,age 7 

The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that.  
--Curt, age   

The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8

How would the world be different if people weren't  married? 

There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8 

What is the right age to get married?  

No age is good to get married at.  You got to be  a fool to get married.  --Freddie, age 6 

Is it better to be single or married?  

It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys.  Boys need someone to clean up after them.  
--Anita, age 9 

I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.  I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8

How do you decide who to marry? 

You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10

How can a stranger tell if two people are  married? 

You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8 

What do your mom and dad have in  common? 

Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age   

How would you make a marriage work?  

Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10

16:36 29Mar2001 TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power Contract <UNS.N>

TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power
Contract
   TUCSON, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2001--Tucson Electric
Power Co. (TEP) has signed a five-year wholesale contract to supply 60
megawatts of electricity to Phelps Dodge Energy Services.
   The contract calls for TEP, beginning in March of 2001, to supply
the power at all times except during the company's peak customer
energy demand periods from July through September of each year.
   TEP Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer James S.
Pignatelli said the contract is an important one for both companies.
"This agreement provides a comfort factor for Phelps Dodge as it plans
ahead for its energy needs," Pignatelli said. "And for TEP, the
contract provides a stable, profitable margin for five years and a
solid boost to our financial outlook in a volatile energy market."
   Pignatelli said the company expects the agreement to generate
revenues of about $30 million annually.
   The contract gives Phelps Dodge the option of receiving the power
at several of its operations outside TEP's service territory. Under
the contract, TEP also can interrupt delivery of power to Phelps Dodge
if the utility experiences significant loss of any electric generating
resources.
   Separate from this agreement, the Phelps Dodge Sierrita copper and
molybdenum mine south of Tucson is a TEP retail customer.
   TEP is the primary subsidiary of UniSource Energy Corp.
(NYSE: UNS), and Arizona's second-largest investor-owned electric
utility.

Because  I had an updated curve for PG&E and not for Malin.  I asked the Malin trader - he hadn't updated his curves but the other guy had.   I am going to start asking so that I am consistant.  Let me know what you want to do and I will show you transactional numbers.

Thanks for letting me know.

Kim:

I would argue that the physical premium should actually be ($.012/MMBtu) as you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could book it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

Chris,

The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as well, or when I fix the prices, do I need to add a new phys premium?

Kim,
 
We are very interested in putting in place  an ISDA for weather derivatives, power, and natural gas transactions in regards  to Citizens Communications.  Please get with me as to Enron's interest no  later than Monday, April 23rd.  There is also some opportunity to do  physical power purchase and sales with Citizen's.  It might be worthwhile  for you to set up a meeting with you, me, and the appropriate power guy (Mike  Grigsby?).
 
Hope all is well.
 
Sincerely,

Hi There!

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the "e mail" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

Attached are the price indications that you asked for.  I pulled these off of our curves and adjusted them for today's price movements.  If you would like to transact, we will have to get more refined prices approved by the desk, which shouldn't take too long.  

Just let me know -

Kim, the attached e-mail is from John Gregg.  He is a lawyer from Washington DC.  His firm represents alot of the Muni's across the country.  He represents Mesa and others in the West.  It appears that Enron is having some problems with WIlcox.  Did we give that account to EES ?  Do you know this JAmie Bellamy ?  If possible we need to get this cleared up so that John does not take it out on us in the furture.

Good to talk with you Frank.  Funny you called when you did.

While you were "gone," the mighty City of Wilcox, AZ signed up with Enron.  I got a call today from a frantic city clerk because Enron has fallen a few months behind in billing after many months of fine service.  This is bad for several reasons, not the least of which is that Enron is paying the pipeline for Wilcox.

The reps name is Jamie Bellamy.

Could you kick him in the butt for one of the smallest munis in the country?

Sara,

Attached is Salt River Projects ISDA attachments.  I know that we have previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and keep me posted on developments.  

Thanks!

Kim

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Chris, attorneys have indicated there is no affiliate problem with EAMR negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the "One Enron" message. 

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a conference call with legal and marketing services to discuss the work to be done so we can flush out the liability issue.  You and I can continue our discussion on price one on one.

Thanks,

Don

Jay,

Please call me when you get a chance. I have a list of customers that we use to serve out of our Socal pool that we want back.  However, we need to establish credit.  and then maybe some contracts.  Can I do < 1 year with these guys without a master ?  Maybe use the GTC?

I need to make some $ so WE can go to Pebble beach.

Dan:

To help your prepare for your meeting in Stamford, here are some thoughts.

PG&E Large Packages Index Trends

1.   PG&E Large Packages is the interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern into PG&E.  The interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern and Kern into SoCal is referred to as SoCal Border.  

2.   PG&E gas supply comes in from three main pipelines:  PGT (Canada), El Paso/Transwestern (San Juan and Permian) and Kern River (Rockies).  With the exception of a few very cold days in Canada and the Northwest, the cheapest supply comes from Canada.  The other two pipes are similarly priced, based on the incremental cost of gas out of the Southwest and what options the supply has.  There is always some marginal demand for supply out of the Southwest into PG&E, but it can be a small number of only about 500,000 MMBtu/d in a shoulder month and 1,000,000 MMBtu on a peak day.  When it is a low demand day PG&E large packages will trade like Malin (PGT interconnect to PG&E).  On a peak day PG&E large packages trades like SoCal border.

3.  Effective April 1, El Paso changed the way gas moves on their system.  It used that anyone with primary delivery point capacity to PG&E could deliver into SoCal on a primary basis.  Now, if you have PG&E primary, you can only get into SoCal on an alternate delivery point basis.  Because capacity is constrained, PG&E primary capacity will generally not flow into SoCal.  Thisis why PG&E Large Packages trades at a discount to SoCal Border.

4.  PG&E large packages is the relevant index for the PP&L deal:  PG&E trades at a significant discount to SoCal because of the reasons listed above.    Anyone with primary SoCal delivery will want to go into SoCal.  This leaves the PG&E capacity as the marginal capacity that folks could use for delivery to Griffith.  If anyone owns primary delivery into SoCal they will use it there.  Citizens is offering Griffith a discount relative to these suppliers.  The good news is that PG&E delivery is still very strong because given the gas supply balance in California the marginal supply out of the southwest is needed.  

5.  PG&E large packages is becoming more liquid:  Now that El Paso has changed the way gas moves on their pipeline there is a much more distinct difference between the types of capacity on El Paso.  Folks that own capacity want ways to hedge its value.  Enron has recognized this and plans to introduce the PG&E large packages point on Enron Online, our internet based trading system.  Trading volume at the PG&E point has increased in the last month and is expected to continue to increase.  This is good for Citizens as the liquidity makes the index more reflective of the market.  It also reduces the risk that the index doesn't print as has often occurred in the past.  (See historical data attached).  It also reduces the spread between the bid and offer at that point.

6.  PG&E Large Packages has gotten much stronger:  it used to be that the San Juan/SoCal Border spreads barely covered variable transport expense.  Now the demand is much stronger in CA and the transportation value has increased.   California is short storage due to growth in demand with the new power plants and the strong economy.  Although demand due to the economy is likely to fall, the new power plants and short storage position still create a very bullish situation.  For example, current valuations for the PG&E index are in the attached spreadsheet below:

And who told you what I do when I am in Scottsdale??  Palo Alto is in Cali - Have you ever heard of Stanford University?  What do you do in Moab?  My friend Harriet was in Vail this past weekend and said it was snowing like crazy.  I don't know - maybe a second date is in order - just for kicks.  when are you coming back to houston?

Moab is in the southeastern part of Utah.  I burned my feet at lake Powell which is also in Utah.  So no second date with your new boyfriend?
By the way I heard that the spa isn't only what, or should I say who, you visit when you go to Phoenix.  Where is Palo Alto, AZ?

Attached is the latest term sheet for Pasadena for April through August.  Just wanted to share with you what we were going to be doing with them in the near term.  Ann, could you help me get this deal into the system?  PLEASE let me know if any of you have any questions.

Thanks,

this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.

Please review and add anything you want and return.

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

Linda, 

Here is my very short list for the tournament. My friend Melissa Reese has
said she will volunteer. Gas has been so crazy over the past week - I have
been extremely busy! Sorry I am so late. I will continue to add or fill in
blanks until you tell me I can't any more. I have been asked if there is room
for sponsors - I said yes to sponsoring teams. 

I will also try to gather trinkets as I get a chance. 

Keep in touch - 

thanks, 

Kim

Dan,

What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will forward to Monica?

Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?

I did make it home - and I managed to catch an airplane at 8:00 the next morning, have two meetings, attend a reception, and go to dinner.  Needless to say, I was very tired by the time I got home on Friday night!!  It was a fun week for me too - I got to see people that I hadn't seen in four years.  As for the weather, you aren't missing anything here this week - cold and rainy - just like portland!

Let me know when you're around - margaritas on a patio is always fun

Hi Manny & Jack,

Attached is our draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural
gas transactions.  Once we get the ISDA signed and executed we can start on
this contract.  It would be good to go ahead and get it in place so that
when/if we want to do a physical deal, we won't have to worry about paper.

Did we get you everything that you need to go forward with the ISDA?

I will talk to you next week.  Have a good weekend.

Thanks,

Kim

Dave,

I think I mentioned this to you before, but I will also need the following attached to the ISDA:

1) duly executed tax forms ro certificates
2) evidence of authority to execute Master Agreement
3) specimen signatures (as to signatories to Master Agreement
4) financials
5) resolution to authorize execution of:  a)master agreement by specified parties and b)  all transactions under the master agreement
6) copy of  Articles of Incorporation
7) bylaws

ENA must provide the same documents to you.  You can ask Sara (pronounced Sora) questions regarding these documents once we get her on the phone.

Call me.

Kim

Sara,

Attached is Salt River Projects ISDA attachments.  I know that we have previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and keep me posted on developments.  

Thanks!

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

  [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]  Tuesday, April 10, 2001           Dear continental.com=
 customer,    We're Changing To Serve You Better This Thursday evening Apri=
l 12th 2001, we are launching a new version of our web reservations system,=
 eService Online.  This marks the start of an exciting new beginning as the=
 reservations platform is 100% provided by Continental.  We're making this =
change because our current product, while good, will not provide us with th=
e flexibility in the future to offer the features that will make travel arr=
anging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience for you.   He=
re's What You Need To Know:  Your Profile Your profile information, includi=
ng your username (KWARD1) and password, has been transferred to the new ver=
sion of eService Online.  To protect your personal information, credit card=
 information has not been transferred.  You will need to update your profil=
e.  Your Itineraries Information on your reservations created before April =
12th will not be saved. If you want to keep a copy for your records, you wi=
ll need to print them prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.  This change does not af=
fect the status of any previous reservations and tickets, but you can not v=
iew them in the new eService Online.    Signing In To enhance security, you=
 will have to sign in for each transaction session to reserve and purchase =
flights.  This means you will have to use your password each time.  To have=
 your password e-mailed to you  click here .  You are strongly encouraged t=
o sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging process.   24 Hour Hold =
Option To prepare for this Thursday's release we will be turning off the "H=
old for 24 hours" option.  The "Hold" option will not be available between =
April 10 and April 12.   Here Are Some of the Changes  More eTicketing The =
new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets (e=
Tickets).  We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by N=
orthwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airli=
nes (CO2000-2349).   Aircraft Seat Maps We rearranged the seat map pages fo=
r easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat selection process and enabled E=
lite-status available seating.   Pricing  The pricing system is enhanced to=
 deliver more current fares based on your selection of either "Search By Lo=
west Fares" or "Search By Schedule."  We also added a gold star to denote "=
continental.com promotional fares," so you know for certain when you receiv=
e a discounted, online-only airfare.   Customer Service  Our customer servi=
ce is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now handle all supp=
ort for online inquiries and reservations services.   While we've made a nu=
mber of improvements to the overall experience, this new version may not, o=
n the surface, appear to offer significant benefits.  These changes lay the=
 foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the future.  W=
e welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  Based on feedbac=
k from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.  Overall, we'r=
e confident that you will appreciate the changes and improvements and look =
forward to continuing to serve you in the future.  Sincerely, Continental A=
irlines Inc.   This is a one-time update e-mail.  You have been sent this e=
-mail as a registered eService Online user to inform you of this change in =
service.  If you have questions or comments, or you would like to unsubscri=
be please reply to: eservice@coair.com   This E-mail was sent to: kward@ect=

I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable.  

Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat.

I will keep you posted -

Arnold,

I must have been looking at the wrong index or report.  I have now gotten access to Natural Gas Intelligent's web-site so I can give very fast and accurate prices.  I am sorry for the confusion and hope that I didn't cause a lot of trouble.  Just so you know, april was $12.56 plus the $.05 premium.

Let me know if you need anything else. 

Thanks,

Kim,

We rec'd your March invoice which reflects a price of $12.63 not $12.38 as
quoted below? Please advise if you will re-invoice for the correct price.

Kim,

It is that time again. We do this 4 times/year. I need to get a cost
forecast by month from you for natural gas through the end of this year.
California Border.

p.s. I know it is early but is our price for March available yet?

Call me - it looks like $20 is excessive - and I agree, the term sheet he put together is lame.  Hope these numbers are what you were looking for -

CalPeak was formed as a project company, and is being funded by UTC.

CalPeak was formed less than two months ago, and has no financials.

We will provide a pro forma balance sheet should the bidder be selected.

Types of typical project support are things like a UT gurantee for one
month's fuel supply, etc.

That price indication does reflect the time value of money - so - if bought - power in 2001 would be billed at $61/MWh.

Kim

Thank you so much! That is quite useful information.

Question relevant to longer-term quotes...are those cash-flow year
"settlement" prices (in other words, if a deal was done today for on-peak
power in the year 2011, would an invoice in the year 2011 be settled at
$61/mwh, or would that price somehow need to be adjusted to reflect
inflation).

In addition to reviewing our Q3 gas and power portfolios, we are currently
assessing various new local generation resources.

As part of our assessment, it would be quite helpful to have a relatively
current forward curve for NYMEX gas, CA Border gas, and SP15 electricity.
Could you provide monthly data for 12-18 months and annual data for 5-10
years for forward transactions?
This doesn't necessarily need to be today's curve, as long as it is recent
and the prices are from the same point in time.

Also, please provide current SP15 and Border gas quotes for Q3 and 12-month
strip.

Thanks!

Where is Moab - the place where you burn your feet?  Barry is in Canada - for his grandmother' funeral.  Went out with him - too forward and outspoken for me - at least for a first date!!

I got the agreement this morning but they misspelled Roseville!!  I am having them change it and will email it to you when I get it.  Do you want me to send you a hard copy or is an email version ok with you?

Let me know -

Thanks,

Kim

PS How are things?

we had a great time.  ed knows a lot about wine and took us to a lot of
boutique wineries where we were in the proprietor's houses hanging out,
drinking wine with them.  it was awesome.  my favorites were pride mountain,
paloma, and guilliams.  they are all very small but make incredible wines.
the place we stayed was nice, nothing great.  we ate at La Trevigne, napa
valley grille, and bouchon.  they were all very good, la trevigne was by far
the best though.  had a lot of fun.  i'll pick you up thursday, are you

Willis,

I just got off of the phone with my credit guy - He says that most of the people on this list are not public companies.  It would be very helpful and will expedite the process if you could get the latest audited financial statements, with notes, from each of these companies.  With the PG&E thing, credit is swamped, but, if I had the info in hand, I could push our cause.

Thanks,

Kim

I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable.  

Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat.

I will keep you posted -

Dan,

Attached is some language that we are considering for a deal.  Could you take a look at is and give me the "legal" ok on it?  Or add to or Change it so that we are legally comfortable with it?

Laird,

You can get prices from me any time - but you know I am always up for wine!!  Anyway, notional prices for Q4 at PG&E City gate are $11.65, 2 years out of  Jan., 2002 are $6.75, and 5 years out of Jan 2002 are $5.80.

Let me know if you need to do anything. 

Also, what is your take on providing gas to all of these power plant developers.  I get at least one call per day from a different developer.  I am thinking that some of them will get built - for the state - but I can't determine who is worthy.  I have been short listed on PRMs RFP for Calpeak power, a sub of United Technologies.  They have no transport across Socal's or PG&E's systems (and neither do we) and United Technologies won't guarantee them 100%.  They said that they would provide "credit mechanisms built into the projects".  I asked what these mechanisms were and said that we take cash.  I haven't heard back!! Ha.

Kim

Kim,

I need your help.

Knauff is looking for fixed, notional prices @ PG&E city-gate as follows:

1.  Q4 2001
2.  2 years:  Jan 1/02 - Dec/03
3.  5 years:  Jan 1/02 - Dec/06

They use 60,000 MMBtu per month or about 2,000 MMBtu/d.

Can you help me?  I owe you and I expect that the only thing I've got of value is wine.

Laird

I can not mention how jealous I am about this trip - but here are some GREAT recommendations -

1)  Indian Springs in Calistoga, which is just on the north side of the wineries.  It has a spa and a huge mineral pool.  Also, the rooms are little bungalows.

2)  A more expensive option - which I havn't tried but comes HIGHLY recommended - Auberge du Soleil.  It has great rooms, a great spa, and great food and wine selection.  In fact, you can go to their we page @ www.aubergedusoleil.com.

You can't go wrong with either one.   Also, a restaurant that has been recommended to me is the Culinary Institute.  It is suppose to be awesome!!

The guys on the gas desk are going to cayman tomarrow - I am very jealous of that too.  Can you tell I need a break??

Let me know what you think of my suggestions -

The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.

Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!

Kim

You seem to be up on current affairs associated with power.

 

Reference to the power crisis in California, did the whacko environmentalist have anything to do with it???  I am hearing that California has not built any power plants in the last 10 years due to environmentalist putting on too many restrictions.

 

One other question about the environmentalist trying to get rid of the hydroelectric dams in Washington State, will this lead to more power problems for California if they accomplish their goal?

 

Let me know? jp

Hey Doug,

How are you?  (Do you remember me - from El Tiempo?)  Just wanted to touch base with you about sailing lessons.  Although the Austrailia trip sounds really cool - I don't think I can manage this year.  Also, I did commit to doing this with one of my friends - can't leave him in the dust!!  Anyway, can you recommend a good place for lessons in Keemah?  Maybe the place you are taking your lessons to be an instructor?  I would appreciate any recommendations!!  Going to AZ tonight - I'm sure I will run into you when I get back.

Have a great weekend,

Kim Ward

Chris, attorneys have indicated there is no affiliate problem with EAMR negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the "One Enron" message. 

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a conference call with legal and marketing services to discuss the work to be done so we can flush out the liability issue.  You and I can continue our discussion on price one on one.

Thanks,

Kathy,

Just had another moment to say hello.  How are you and how are things?  Still busy here - and I haven't even seen Robin - I think she has given up on me!!  In fact, I think I will call her when I finish this email.  At least I know I will see her in a couple of weeks when Chris and Katie come to houston.  Wish you could come with them - that would be fun!

Still working on the man situation - it was a topic of coversation amongst my friends last night.  I will keep you posted!

Hope all is well and keep in touch!!

Love, Kim

I was thrilled to hear from you today.

I sure miss you and Robin.  Seems strange not to be driving to your house
on Thursdays now.  I have a little more free time now so I can quilt and
visit with my grandchildren.

Mel is back to work now and maybe things will be getting back to some
what of a normal life for us.  The past year and half has been hard on
us. I know we just have to be patient and things will get better.  You
just go along with life and then when you or your spouse has health
problems it creates a whole new ball game.  I have great faith in the
Lord to see us through any thing.  Mel said to say hi too. ( he just came
up to my office)

When you get an address please email me that so when I finish your quilt
I can mail it to you.

Hope you find a nice man and your life becomes so full that
maybe work will take a back seat.  Maybe a  big house you can fill with
kids?????

Take care of yourself and let me hear from you again.

Love, Kathy

The expense should have shown up on my hotel receipt and was authorized and approved by my boss.  This expense should be reimbursed.

David

The only reason why a gym expense form would not be authorised, is if there was no prove of payment. (receipt).  If you do have a receipt for the gym expenses please send the form directly to me and I will authorise the form immediately.

Thanks

Abu,

I have just rec'd back from HR an expense form for Kim Ward claiming back gym membership expenses.  All there is on the sheet is a tick indicating 'not authorised'.  Perhaps more information from you would help us solve the issue as I have absolutely nothing to work on?

Wes,

Attached is our Master Firm Purchase/Sale agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Let me know if you have any questions - I can have our legal team standing by to answer them.  Also, if you need any price info, just let me know.

Bob, 

I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.  I hope that you will take a look at it.  Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.

Also,  I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.  Let me know if you need anything else!!

Thanks,

Kim

Darla,

This is what I have been able to find so far regarding fixed prices for citizens for Feb:

50,000/mo @ $7.55
50,000/mo @ $7.96
100,000/ mo @ $9.07

we also did a deal for 1,565/day @ $7.12.

Have they given you any information that you can compare this to?  Let me know if you have any questions and I will send you a spreadsheet with all fixed price deals I have done to date.  March and april should be final.  You can send me a monthly email when you are ready to do - say - mays invoice - and I will send you everything I have done with them.

Call me with questions -

Kim
