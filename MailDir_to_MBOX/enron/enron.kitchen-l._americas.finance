Hey guys, I would like to get with you to discuss our hedge policies.  I am concerned about the recent accounting around the wind hedge (and not necessarlily the outcome in this particular case!).  If the outcome had been reversed (ie. a loss on the hedges existed) we would have had no choice but to book it.  The issue is that nobody commmunicated or documented the designation of these positions as hedges of the "wind" PPA.  It occurs to me that we do not have any process that requires coodination when you set up an accrual book. As you know the designation criteria are rigid for acctg purposes.  If we miss it, we can't cure it and the acctg would be MTM for the life of the contracts.  I will set a metting to discuss.

Wes

Bill, why don't you and I get together to discuss the proposal. As you know, we are intending to transfer credit risk through the Project X, Y and Z structures but not likely the most riskier of credits. All of the structures rely on CDO and synthetic CDO structures. In addition, we have received indications of interest on non-funded risk transfer structures, pure first loss transfer, that may be interesting to review.

Hope alls well and you're enjoying life in Houston.  One of the projects my group (Enron Credit - Syndication), are currently working on is to try and originate, structure and place a High Yield and / or Emerging Market CDO, which is made up of both Enron risks and externally originated risks. The plan would be to provide a cost effective way for Enron to hedge its credit exposure to riskier counterparties.   I am not sure if Enron North America has any of this type of exposure, but would be interested to talk to someone and find out if there is any way that we might be able to help your group.   I attach a short presentation which outlines the rationale for what we are doing.

 << File: hy int pitch 020801 v2.ppt >> 

I am going to be in Houston the week of the 17th September and would appreciate a steer as to who would be the best person to speak to on this.

Re canada: rob is predicting $462mm canadian cash balance for year end. Approx half is due to organic cash flow. The rest is a byproduct of slapshot. I've got a call into wes to see if these numbers were in the 2nd current estimate or not. I've talked with stephen douglas about getting the cash back early through a repurchase of the preferred shares ecc issued to corp earlier this year. I should have more info by our mtg this afternoon.

Clarification:
(i) Broker Margins: How much margin do we think we can bring back via Paribas? The full $60mm?
(ii)  Peoples:  Can I sweep the $10mm to Enron and agree to put it back with a gty? Can we put the $40mm back to Peoples if necessary? What is the prepay - they possibly prepay us?    
Others I've got.

Thanks.

Joe
(i)	Broker Margins		
	Approx:	 $50mm
	Availability:	 End of Week
	Probability:	 85%
	Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.

(ii)	Peoples JV
	Approx:	$135mm
	Availability:	Within month
	Probability:	50%
	We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.

(iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power).  
	Approx:	$25.5mm
	Availability:	Dependent on whether financing
	Probability:	50%
	If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week.

(iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank)

Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off.

Joe, yes let's get together this week.  I have had some discussions with the Credit Trading team but nothing of real substance yet.  I am still curious to understand what risks we will be left holding in the equity tranche.  Also, I am not sure how they would propose to deal with the dyanmic nature of the derivative portfolio.
 
I have had to reschedule with Robina a couple of times.   We were trying to get a video conference call together but now may delay until Robina's visit.
 
I'll keep you informed.
 
Bill

The procedures for ensuring that all accrual books are known and captured by the appropriate parties is as follows:

Current inventory of accrual books and their contents will be provided to Financial Operations and Risk Controls by Risk Management
Risk Management will cc: accrual book requests to Financial Operations to ensure that they are aware when new books are created
Risk Controls will maintain a library of accrual books in RisktRAC
Financial Operations will communicate with Risk Management whenever disclosures are being made related to accrual positions to ensure that all books are included

John:

We still do not have a deal with the government.  They have delayed giving us a written proposal over the last two weeks.  The latest is that they have said that they will give us something on Tuesday of next week.

With respect to the burn rate, we are projecting about $20 million in expenditures over the next month.  Our current investment is about $220 million.

I think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and what the plan is over the next couple of months.  The investment is currently funded through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB.  The WestLB vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations.  The plan is to have the OPIC financing in place to take out the WestLB vehicle.  This would infer an approximate $95 million equity investment upon the take-out of the WestLB vehicle.  We are currently in the process of syndicating the equity.  We have one indicative proposal for 50% of the equity.  We hope to have another next week.

There are some specific timing issues that you need to be aware of.  WestLB did not want to take operating risk in the financing.  Our position with WestLB is that we do not reach  commercial operations until we reach the start date of the Petrobras contract.  We are currently producing energy into the grid.  At some point, WestLB could try to force us to take out the entire vehicle prior to the OPIC funding.  Depending upon the timing, this could represent a cash flow of up to $280 million for a short period of time.

Please let me know what other questions you have.

Brett

Hi Louise,
When we met on Friday you mentioned that the headcount report was still wrong. If you can let me know what your concerns are, I'd be happy to research. Thanks!

Yes. $300mm will be used on Sept 29th to repay the $300mm principal amount due associated with the financing executed last year to purchase the Alberta PPA. It was already figured in the plan.

Sorry. A bit behind on my emails. Still hustling to find $ for quarter end. I may try to call you a bit later on storage but we did not see that deal. Storage doesn't fit any of the capital pricing scenarios we have laid out - balance sheet, prm, or off balance sheet. I think, given that it's a liquid asset, it should be priced more like prm activity than pure debt if it is to attract a capital charge.

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Let's discuss

Had conf calls with godfrey, lamb and mitchell on indian mesa 2. I have a quick meeting with legal on interpreting the contract ambiguity re curtailment this morning and can fill you in on all those discussions shortly. BBB+/BBB- issue needs another followup today and hopefully can be put away. Also, re the cashflow from canada. Suspicion is approx 40% is due from ena to ecc so it might get washed out in the consolidated ea reporting. Wes's team comparing ecc's proj financials to what was included for ecc in the current estimate.

Greg Adams in Corp is preparing a 9/30 look at funds flow/operating cash flow at the corporate and business unit levels for delivery Monday. I'd prefer to distribute that to you than cobble together figures from 9/24 (latest data dump) given the large amount of activity (Wimpy, Inventory, Mahonia) that took place the last week of September.

Louise, I can certainly put this together for you but I'm not sure it will be of much use - Canada has always been considered as "restricted cash" since the ENA cannot sweep without cross-border tax implications. As a result, Houston in the past has not required any cash flow numbers. Please advise, thanks, rob.

We have just recently completed a three year storage transaction with Centana Stg.  The demand charge is around $108,00 each month.  We are currently filling the storage with plans to inject 500,000 MMbtu in September and October.  This would mean cash payments for gas of around $1,250,000 in October and the same in November.

Once you do, you can never go back. It will interfere with every dinner, theatre, social event you plan. But it is quite powerful for communications and managing a group while traveling.

Capital curve model is complete. We are running several pricing scenarios to validate the mechanics to ensure that the new zero curve does accurately reflect interest expense. We should be ready to go by the end of next week. I would like to implement the week we return from the offsite. As you can see below, while we have priced several deals to date, only two have actually closed and funded.

The numbers look good.

Return date - June 18th.

Is Lee above Bob?  I presume so - don't mind the dinner but some time at the end of June.

Regards

Louise

Hey there! Congrats with Scott William. I hope all is going well. Fifteen days and counting till our third arrival. I've attached the DASH that documented the divestiture. The quick summary of the economics per Heather Kroll are as follows:

Original Basis of $8mm.
Signed the Purchase and Sale Agreement on May 16 for $22mm (gain of $14mm)

Sold put for $3.5mm with $1.7mm granted to origination. I don't know for sure what the desk booked.
The coal supply contract resulted in $5mm mark to market to EGM.

The FERC 203 filing has been made regarding market power. They are not expecting any issues with FERC or the North Carolina commission and expect final approval by the beginning of July.

Net gain of about $21mm on transaction.

Chris Lee, the managing partner of Highstar, has requested the opportunity to take you and I out to dinner sometime after you've returned and settled back in to discuss the merits of Enron's investment in Highstar. If that's of interest let me know and I can schedule some time.

Once again, congratulations. Do you have an expected return date yet?
Joe

	We can not get the cost of funds data until Monday to pull the current PRM balance by counterparty.  We should have the OTC margin analysis through October soon.  We gave it to you yesterday in two pieces, however, we will have it on one report today.  Georganne indicated that you have the Nymex initial margin balances as of yesterday, it was net about $60 million.  We will be receiving @ $25 million today.  We can update that report for today.  Let me know if this is what you need.

Particularly I am looking for OTC margin analysis with updates (including all counterparties and with October) and also I want to know the actual Nymex balance as off yesterday - I can see cash flows but not the balance.

Market Update

The market has opened with a weak tone this morning given the collapse in
equity futures - Dow futures down 408, S&P down 29 and NASDAQ down 40 - and
the collapse of some recent new issues in the secondary market.  IBM printed
a $1.5bn five year yesterday at T+117 that just traded at T+130.  What is
leading the collapse in spreads?  BAS has several observations:

* The absolute level of Treasury yields will continue to result in new issue
supply that is priced at ever widening new issue premiums.  Most issuers are
more coupon sensitive than spread sensitive and, as a result, will be
willing to pay a large new issue concession given the attractive level of
overall coupons.

* Although we have not seen it yet in the corporate bond market, an inverted
credit curve is not out of the question given the steepness of the Treasury
curve.  Two and three year securities in particular, almost need to be
priced on a coupon basis.

* The technicals of the market are beginning to deteriorate.  Insurance
companies, traditionally the largest buyer of long assets, appetite for new
product may begin fade as claim estimates climb.  Balanced funds, may need
to begin selling to rebalance portfolios given the meltdown in the equity
market.  The dealer community and the buyside is trying to hold on to market
gains for the year.

Despite the negative tone, BAS feels that issuers in the energy sector will
continue to have access to the primary market in the near-term (albeit at
wider spreads) due to the defensive nature of the sector and the absolute
implosion of other sectors (autos, media, lodging, retail, airlines, etc).  

Please do not hesitate to call should you have any questions on the state of
the current marketplace.

Mostly a social call. Brief discussion on noise in the market he's hearing and reading, etc. He walked me through oustanding issues on alamac that he is working with duran and heather to resolve. Heather tells me there are only two remaining issues so I'll followup on those. I suggested rather than buying assets from us (alamac), he should be ready for us to ask him to co-invest alongside us if we need equity partners in transactions (bny, cogentrix, uae, etc - didn't discuss any particular deals). Told him we'd expect him to turn the deals quickly. He's ready and willing to be here any day we have something to discuss with him. I can fill you in on more details later. Budget allocation from glisan has been postponed. I will let you know the outcome when its resolved.

I wanted to make sure you were aware of the current situation with Eletrobolt.  With respect to the current liquidity issues, we are working to extend the WestLB facility over year-end to give us cushion with respect to the OPIC financing.  The potential exposures depending on when WestLB has to be taken out, when OPIC funds and when equity syndication occurs is outlined below.  Please let me know what other questions I can answer or if you would like to discuss the specifics further.  My cell phone number is (5511) 9233-7428.

John:

We still do not have a deal with the government.  They have delayed giving us a written proposal over the last two weeks.  The latest is that they have said that they will give us something on Tuesday of next week.

With respect to the burn rate, we are projecting about $20 million in expenditures over the next month.  Our current investment is about $220 million.

I think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and what the plan is over the next couple of months.  The investment is currently funded through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB.  The WestLB vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations.  The plan is to have the OPIC financing in place to take out the WestLB vehicle.  This would infer an approximate $95 million equity investment upon the take-out of the WestLB vehicle.  We are currently in the process of syndicating the equity.  We have one indicative proposal for 50% of the equity.  We hope to have another next week.

There are some specific timing issues that you need to be aware of.  WestLB did not want to take operating risk in the financing.  Our position with WestLB is that we do not reach  commercial operations until we reach the start date of the Petrobras contract.  We are currently producing energy into the grid.  At some point, WestLB could try to force us to take out the entire vehicle prior to the OPIC funding.  Depending upon the timing, this could represent a cash flow of up to $280 million for a short period of time.

Please let me know what other questions you have.

Brett

I will follow up with Wes to see if it is already in the plan. I also have a call into Rob to inquire if he has any needs for the excess cash either in the short or long term. Depending on the response, I will get with Steve Douglas to look at ways of getting the cash back to the US for debt repayment in the most tax efficient manner. Thanks for the heads up.

Pat:

Pursuant to our telephone conversations, this e-mail is to confirm Enron's desire to begin the process of purchasing the outstanding securities associated with ENA CLO I Trust.  I have confirmed that the April 30, 2001 liability due under the remaining active ISDA is $3.71 million.  As your firm conducts discussions with investors, our counsel has recommended language to be used as follows:

"As has been disclosed in recent Monthly Reports, the underlying assets of
ENA CLO I have continued to perform under expectations.  Given current
economic conditions, it is possible that the assets will continue to
underperform for the foreseeable future.  In addition, while Enron
continues to seek to maximize the recovery on all of
the portfolio assets, it is difficult to predict the
ultimate recovery that can be expected on the portfolio assets, or the
ultimate recovery that Noteholders can expect.

	As you know, Enron has responded to Noteholder concerns by providing
substantial additional structural support to ENA CLO I.  In lieu of providing 
further support, Enron is offering to purchase all of the
outstanding Notes on April 30, 2001 for the principal balance plus accrued
interest.

	Enron believes that this proposal is the most expeditious and effective
means of addressing the concerns of the Noteholders.  Noteholders are
encouraged to contact Bear,Stearns with any comments or questions that they
may have regarding this proposal."


Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Sincerely,
Tim DeSpain
Deputy Treasurer

Louise,

Sounds like this is a plastics off take deal, as yet unsigned due to negotiation over tenor of the arrangement.  The est. margin is now $8mm (lowered from $10mm).  I have discussed with Jean and she will follow up as appropriate.

Joe,
We are looking at this again. There seem to be even bigger issues than accounting with the regional ERC's, such as limited liquidity and trading volumes, extremely long transfer times for the local issuing authority to change title, etc. Then, of course, Barclay's has to agree to take them. We will push hard internally to get them in; then start working on Barclays when we have a strong story. I am not optimistic, but I do feel the pressure that you are under. Shankman and McConnell called me in to tell me what you told me last week - get all inventory off ASAP. I recommend that we nail down the SO2 extension before pushing Barclays on other products. Is that OK with you?

As an additional follow-up, as part of the approval process, I was told that ENA and EE&CC have the right to opt out of this fund at any time during the first twelve months without cause and without penalty.  If this is something that neither you nor Dave want to do, then I suggest exercising this option.

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Let's discuss

We have just recently completed a three year storage transaction with Centana Stg.  The demand charge is around $108,00 each month.  We are currently filling the storage with plans to inject 500,000 MMbtu in September and October.  This would mean cash payments for gas of around $1,250,000 in October and the same in November.

As we approach the end of the quarter we are closely monitoring our funds flow targets for Enron Americas.  We would like you to let us know if you are planning to enter into any transactions within your groups which will impact those targets, either positively or negatively.  We would like information on all deals which impact significantly our funds flow targets prior to you entering into them.  Please note that this is not just structured transactions but even a storage transaction where we would be injecting would involve cash going out of Enron.

Enron's cash liquidity position is very strong and there is not an issue of whether or not we enter into a transaction but we must ensure we correctly price any transactions and indeed send clear signals to the orginators and traders with regards to our funds flow targets.

Please let John or Louise know if you have any transactions which may occur with funds flow implications.  Should you need any indications of pricing, please contact Joe Deffner.

Louise,

We were trying to set a meeting for Thursday when Brian returns from Japan, but based on your note it may not be necessary.  Brian and I have discussed and we do not see this developmental activity fitting the new charter of EEOS. The opportunities if any would have to be for NEPCO and based on the activity in the year, it is difficult to see a cost/benefit analysis favorable for them. We support your decision of transferring the ownership of this endeavor to EA. We could work a deal with respect to potential benefit via NEPCO based on a finder's fee concept to EA if the fund provides a negotiated project for NEPCO. 

My check of the accounting agrees with yours and we will need to work out a transfer concept for the monies paid to-date.  As far as the asset is concerned, the only relief we could provide is of the aspirin variety for our bosses as we end up in Wholesale also.

Keith





	Louise Kitchen@ECT 07/02/2001 08:57 AM 	   To: Brian Stanley/EU/Enron@ENRON, Keith Dodson/NA/Enron@ENRON  cc:   Subject: AIG Highstar	


Keith/Brian,

The following money has been sent to AIG Highstar to date.  This week we will be asked for further monies (probably around $650,000 each)
to pay for the acquisition of Alamac from Enron.

EEOS   $914,107   
ENA       914,107
          ------------------
          $1,828,214  (fundings made in 12\00 and 2\01)

I would suggest that we look at transferring all of this to Enron Americas as we are actively managing the position (or rather looking at potential exit strategies) bearing in mind the new status of EEOS.  The management of this is done by Joe Deffner as the primary role of this fund was to be a new vehicle for financing similar to LJM.  Obviously, Enron Americas does not want the asset so if you do, please keep it.  

I am meeting with the head of funds at AIG in a July to discuss the future of this fund further.  Let me know what you want to do.

Thanks

Louise

Subject:	Draft Capital Charge Memo

This is a draft memo we are planning to send out to start addressing the 15%  standard across all transactions.  Any issues please let me know.

Louise

Capital Book

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:
Joe Deffner		853-7117
Alan Quaintance	345-7731

Hey there! Congrats with Scott William. I hope all is going well. Fifteen days and counting till our third arrival. I've attached the DASH that documented the divestiture. The quick summary of the economics per Heather Kroll are as follows:

Original Basis of $8mm.
Signed the Purchase and Sale Agreement on May 16 for $22mm (gain of $14mm)

Sold put for $3.5mm with $1.7mm granted to origination. I don't know for sure what the desk booked.
The coal supply contract resulted in $5mm mark to market to EGM.

The FERC 203 filing has been made regarding market power. They are not expecting any issues with FERC or the North Carolina commission and expect final approval by the beginning of July.

Net gain of about $21mm on transaction.

Chris Lee, the managing partner of Highstar, has requested the opportunity to take you and I out to dinner sometime after you've returned and settled back in to discuss the merits of Enron's investment in Highstar. If that's of interest let me know and I can schedule some time.

Once again, congratulations. Do you have an expected return date yet?
Joe

Hi Louise,
Currently we have 2001 forecast and 2002 plan as the information to be provided to you on the templates. Would you like for us to add in 2001 plan, as we did for the back-office presentations? 

Also, have you had an opportunity to create the goals & objectives portion of their presentation? 

FYI- each team has completed their expense portion of the plan presentation.  I'll send up a book Monday- the teams are still working on the 2001 margin forecast, so I'll send that update as soon as it's available.

The following is a status update regarding the agreed upon decision to allocate Drift to the Business Units on April 26, 2001:

 A methodology and systems reporting have been developed and an analysis prepared for the period Jan 2001 - April 2001.  During May, discussions were held with each of the business units regarding the methodolgy which applies to all business units and the analysis of results for Jan- April.  

A request was made to begin the Drift Allocation process from April 2001.  

During this week, we are meeting with the business units to review April and May numbers and processes.  We are expecting to allocate April and May to the individual business unit's Drift lines next week.   

June numbers will be accumulated on the DPR in an Intra-Month Allocated Drift line and allocated on the last business day's DPR to the Business Unit.

 Please do not hesitate to call me, 3-3210,  or the representatives of your business unit,  if you require additional information.

Sheila

Agreed. Haedicke has given me travis and mary cook as legal and I understand they are digging through the contracts. I want to verify with litigation that the scope of the lawsuits re the el paso swaps would preclude their inclusion in a master netting agreement. I'm walking lenders through ena on/off bs debt and why majority is not, and must not, be considered enron recourse for sizing addtl leverage.

We are receiving questions about your request.  There is some confusion about what you want.  Is it that the teams need to be broken down differently? Is it a weekly thing as opposed to monthly?  Each commercial team has a coordinator for P & L reporting and they prepare acctg reports as requested on behalf of the commercial lead.  They will revise as you wish,  we just need to know how you would like to change what you are getting.  By the way,  don't forget that there is somewhat detailed reporting of P & L in the monthly team report with detail of margin as well as expense breakdown into 20 types from comp and benefits to rent,  depreciation, t&e, etc.  These each are a further break out of the weekly report I believe you are referring to below.   The team reports are, however, monthly only, but are the basis for what you receive weekly. Let me know what you want to do.

Could you all add to your weekly reports a P/L statement breaking down your income to date this year.  It is difficult to actually break down the numbers in the weekly P/L sheets delivered by Wes's group.  A break down on your weekly reports would be great.

Please could you email all weekly reports to Tammie Schoppe on a Friday (and copy me) and Tammie will distribute to John.  I have spent some time this week bringing John up to speed on everybody's areas and what you each have going on.  

Tammie has all of my contact numbers and will be in contact with me.  I am sure I will be back in contact in the next few weeks and I will be picking up email after I initially come to terms with the lack of sleep etc.  

Take care

Louise

	EIM trades pulp and paper on the Nymex.  I think we were looking at the net nymex total when you were down earlier.  The print is so small.  For the month of October      Initial margin was (.3) and variation margin is .3, net zero for EIM.

	CGAS went into the Hawaii vehicle in March of 2001. (a 125 transaction vehicle)  ENA received $58.0.

	Canada has $1.4 million in the bank as of this morning.  Canada just wired $45.0 million to Houston on Monday (10/22).

Hello Andy.

It's been a long time since we talked, but I trust that things are well with
you and Lea.

The reason for my email is that my business partners Sunil Hirani and Dik
Blewitt are going to be in Houston visiting with Ken Lay at 10:30 A.M. on
Wednesday.  I think that you would find their business (trading credit risk)
to be of interest, and I know they would like to meet you.

Would you have any time on your calendar for lunch or for an introduction
during the afternoon?

Briefly,  Sunil is the co-founder of creditex, a the credit derivatives
trading platform that the market has adopted as the e-market for credit
derivatives.  Dik is Chief Strategic Officer of creditex.

My relationship with Dik and Sunil comes from our shared interest in trading
syndicated loans.  creditex and I have co-founded LoanX, Inc., to do for the
loan market what creditex has done for the credit derivatives market.

Sorry for the out-of-the blue email, but I look forward to catching up with
you in the future.

I've copied Sunil and Dik to facilitate any schedule coordination that might
be possible.

My best to Lea.

Investment in AIG on balance sheet:

EEOS   $914,107

          ------------------
          $1,828,214  (fundings made in 12\00 and 2\01)

Fair Value of Alamac investment on ENA's books: $22,000,000

Origination taken on original FV mark = $14,522,411 (50\50 ENA and EIM)*

*Issue: In the 1Q origination we built up the "basis" for certain capital improvements and the expected net operating loss of the plant through APRIL, which was the anticipated sale date to AIG.  We now have the actual losses through 6\30 to deal with.  I will send you a separate schedule with the details but basically we are looking @ $1.2 Million that needs to be shared with EIM.  These losses do not automatically flow there as NCPH is an unconsolidated entity.

Estimated upside on power option $1.7 Million (on hotlist for 3Q)  Premium coming to us is around $3.5 Million. (?)

PV of coal supply deal on EGM's books is $4,325,000 asset.

That was a pretty clear answer and pretty speedy too.  Suggest we have a chat at some point Dave on how we move forward on this.

I am NOT taking the P/L swings or funding this investment.  If there is confusion, let's get together with Dave.

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Let's discuss

Louise

With regards to the existing deal, the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal/accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with. I would hope costs would be lower on future additions. Having said that, though, the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity. To the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation, the put/call price protection embeds more enron risk in the financing. In the current environment, I am less than confident I could sell the unsecured enron piece shortly. Jim, can you stay point on this exercise for the ercs and other items. Thanks.

Hi Louise-
Congrats on Scott! Hope all is going well on that front.

I've reviewed Chris' numbers and it looks like he's missing the MPR adjustments from Q1 as well as some fees:


LV Cogen				($744K)
Big Horn				($3.2M)
Pioneer Chlor				($252K)

Structuring Fees/E-Next Generation	($1M)	

Were you expecting him to include these in his recap for you? If not, his numbers are good. Please advise. Thanks!

These are my weekly update reports which highlight what each group has been doing this week.  Keeps me in the loop.  I would like them to add a breakdown of their income booked (YTD) as it doesn't always tie to what appears on the financials.

I will attach Calger's - nothing difficult, but no doubt they are trying to find out what numbers are actually showing up next to their names so they can explain it.    Therefore in the exmaple below Chris says he has mads $57.7 m this year - does that tie to the number on our earnings report?   I didn't ask for forecasts as Chris has below - just an explanation of their p&l so far this year.

This is just a simple note which they need to add to their weekly updates - shouldn't involve you guys - unless of course the numbers don't tie - so I think that's why you had phone calls


Gross Margin to Date:
Pastoria 			$41MM
PSCo (Fountain Valley):		$5MM  ($12MM more will be recognized Q3).
Turbine Swap:			$3.7MM ($2.1MM to Jacoby)
DWR:				$7MM
Other:				$1MM
				$57.7MM

Hotlist Summary:
PSCo, Q3			$12MM
DWR, Q2			$10MM
Various Commodity:		$10MM
Las Vegas, Q3			$20MM
Blue Dog Sale, Q3		$3.5MM
Saguaro Sale, Q3		$5MM
Longview, Q4			$15MM
				$75.5MM

Total Forecast:			$133.2MM


Hope that's clear - Tammie can show you the weekly reports if you need further clarification.


Off to sleep now - unbelievable to be able to say that at 3pm!!!

Thanks

Louise

We are receiving questions about your request.  There is some confusion about what you want.  Is it that the teams need to be broken down differently? Is it a weekly thing as opposed to monthly?  Each commercial team has a coordinator for P & L reporting and they prepare acctg reports as requested on behalf of the commercial lead.  They will revise as you wish,  we just need to know how you would like to change what you are getting.  By the way,  don't forget that there is somewhat detailed reporting of P & L in the monthly team report with detail of margin as well as expense breakdown into 20 types from comp and benefits to rent,  depreciation, t&e, etc.  These each are a further break out of the weekly report I believe you are referring to below.   The team reports are, however, monthly only, but are the basis for what you receive weekly. Let me know what you want to do.

Wes

Could you all add to your weekly reports a P/L statement breaking down your income to date this year.  It is difficult to actually break down the numbers in the weekly P/L sheets delivered by Wes's group.  A break down on your weekly reports would be great.

Please could you email all weekly reports to Tammie Schoppe on a Friday (and copy me) and Tammie will distribute to John.  I have spent some time this week bringing John up to speed on everybody's areas and what you each have going on.  

Tammie has all of my contact numbers and will be in contact with me.  I am sure I will be back in contact in the next few weeks and I will be picking up email after I initially come to terms with the lack of sleep etc.  

Take care

Louise

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:
Joe Deffner		853-7117
Alan Quaintance	345-7731

Louise,

As discussed, the Austin project  shows as a negative because the project was positive cash until mid-June. The City of Austin paid ENA in advance of the project costs actually being incurred.  By the end of this quarter, the Austin Project will have a positive asset balance of $750K to $1million.

The "Global Assets (Cuiaba & BBPL)on EA's books" line relates to development and reimbursable costs that were not moved over with the MTM piece.  While these costs were being transferred to G.A., a reimbursement was actually received for part of the BBPL costs.  Since we had moved the costs, the payment caused us to have a negative balance at May 31.  This is currently being reconciled and the balance will be $0 at quarter-end.

Call if you need more information.
Regards
Jody
