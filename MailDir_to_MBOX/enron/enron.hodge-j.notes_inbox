Unfortunately the unassigned contracts are all master contracts. 

As far as the sales transactions for delivery risk, looks like we only have 
25 (please note that 2 of these transactions are tied to GTCs due to the CES 
contract we inherited not being executed AND that these two deals are with 
Midcon Texas for whom I we already have some outstanding receivable issues 
with). I've attached a spreadsheet of the sales transactions (modified the 
outstanding transaction report eliminating the transactions where ENA is 
buyer) which should help Bryce to better determine our situation. The 
spreadsheet lists transaction numbers, counterparty name, ect. Please let me 
know if I can do anything else.

Cyndie.

Thanks so much for your quick response.  Are the other 215 'master' type 
contracts?  I would agree that the Appalachian deals probably won't get 
assigned - these are John Singer's I believe.  I am really only concerned 
about those contracts where we are selling gas.  To the extent that you can 
help Bryce Baxter determine which of those unasssigned deals are sales so he 
can quantify the delivery risk, I would greatly appreciate it.  Jeff, I 
assume that the 215 that do not have deals are really defunct, since all new 
deals would be done on ENA paper?

Currently we still have 289 active (meaning not terminated) unassigned CES 
contracts. As far as those with transactions, only 74 of the 289 have 
'active' deals. Currently, or as I understand the situation, Porter & Hedges 
(CES's legal counsel for CES Wholesale) is still driving the consent process 
for CES, we are not in the driver's seat.
 An additional note; many of the outstanding consents are with Appalachian 
producers who may never actually execute a consent based on the 
characteristics of the 'customer'.
As far as any future steps that Enron may chose to execute; I am prepared to 
help in anyway I can.

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that 
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are 
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these 
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a 
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery 
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are 
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated 
with the unassigned, active contracts.

Two quick questions - first, where will the rehypothecation procedures with 
regard to Stoneville be documented (between Stoneville and Enron)?  Second, 
why did the "Interest Rate" definition in the Margin Agreement Amendment 
change from a Libor-based number to a Fed Funds-based number?  Thanks again

Subject: CES-CDC transaction

Per our discussion, it has been brought to my attention that there is
another CES transaction that ENA has been asked to serve that we have been
unable to find in any of the CES/ENA contracts or paper work.  It is a
three month transaction for 40,000/day at the Columbia Gulf-Mainline Pool,
priced at the Gas Daily Monthly Index plus $.0125.    The transaction is
with the Columbia Distribution Companies:  Columbia Gas of Ohio, Virginia,
Kentucky, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.  I have sent copies of the agreements
to you via fax.

The good news is that this is an index transaction, so there is no forward
exposure.  The bad news is that, since we did not know about this
transaction prior to the beginning of December, by the time CDC contacted
us (because there was no nomination made), prices had risen considerably
from the first of the month index.  ENA immediately purchased base load
supply to cover this, which at this point has drastically reduced the
exposure; however, ENA will look to CES to cover the difference between the
contract price and the rest of the month pricing as of 12/1/00.

The weighted average price of rest of the month sales at the Henry Hub on
EnronOnLine for 12/1/00 was $6.6125.  Since Henry Hub is a more liquid
location than Columbia Gulf-Mainline, that is how the transaction was
hedged.  The basis difference between Henry Hub and Columbia Mainline (per
the monthly indices) was $.05, making ENA's cost to cover the CDC volumes
$6.6625.  This makes the total dollar amount $706,800  (40,000/d x 31 days
x the difference between the contract price and the cost to cover, or
$.57).

Please call me once you have had a chance to review this with the proper
CES representatives or if you have any questions.  My number is
713/853-5514.  Thanks for your assistance.

How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day 
or as of midnight?
How much of the gas went into California?
What was the average price or the high and low price?

I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and 
more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down.

Jeff - Mary Klyasheff has passed on the review of the DynegyDirect 
Registration Documents to Fred Jacobsen at Peoples Energy.  I know that as of 
today he has not reviewed the documents.  Therefore, I am certain that we are 
farther along in the process.  Can you coordinate with Fred to figure out the 
most efficient and expedient method for review and approval?  His e-mail is 
f.jacobsen@pecorp.com and his phone is 312-240-7284.

As always, Thanks.

Gregg

Brad/Alan -

Pursuant to our discussion last week, attached is a revised version of the 
Annex for Confirmation Central.  I have incorporated all of the comments we 
discussed and modified certain other provisions to more accurately reflect 
activity within the Module.

I have discussed the attached with Jeff Hodge and, at least initially, do not 
believe that any further information is needed for confirmation attachments 
for natural gas products.  Jeff will confirm this for me once he has 
completed his review of the agreement.  I also am awaiting Leslie's comments 
to the document.

I have a call out on the timing for retention of the information through the 
Module (Section 4(c)), however, since this is not intended to be a complete 
records retention period, the timing associated with the access in this area 
may be something more so driven by availability of space within 
CommodityLogic's database.

Please look over the attached when you have a chance and let me know if you 
should have any further comments or questions.

I will be out of town on Thursday and Friday, but will have access to e-mail 
on both days.  I will also be getting voice messages during that time.

Hello Jeff - I'm not chasing at all, but wondered when the Unanimous Consent 
might have been finalised - as you can see it won't delay the 
recapitalization process but will be needed in due course for registration. I 
promised I would let local counsel know a likely timeframe.
Many thanks for your help.

apparently the notary is not going to raise problems but he is not going to
register the deed in his books until he receives the original of the proxy
(the unanimous consent can be attached to it later although it will be
mentioned in the deed).
When do you think the courier will be here?

Jeff,

I spoke with Bill B in credit this morning - currently, his main concern with 
Stoneville is the collateral issue.  We had assumed that Stoneville will have 
no credit line and all potential mark-to-market changes would be taken care 
of through rehypothecation (just like Chase).  However, we need to address 
the credit risk of Stoneville between when the margin call occurs and when 
the rehypothecation occurs.  He was also concerned where these 
rehypothecation procedures would be documented.  Let me know, but as I 
understand it, the Chase agreement should be a good format for this master 
agreement.  Thanks.

Michael

Jeff, Bill,

I received a call today from Elsa Villareal on the Texas Desk and confirmed 
with OGE's credit that due to the weather, wells have been shut in in 
Oklahoma and they are calling Force Majore on one of their Interruptable 
contracts to ENA (Sitara #495794).  I have been assured by OGE all firm gas 
transactions will continue to flow, only this one transaction will be 
effected.  The transaction calls for 15,000 mmbtu/day and is being cut down 
to 7,500/day through Saturday.

High Priority

Please draft a Master Physical per the attached credit worksheet.  This 
request has priority as the originator is looking to enter into this deal and 
the agreement needs to be in place.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

Under the direction of Mark Frevert, Public Relations has created a Weekly

Industrial Markets and Global Markets at the click of a button.  Our goal is 
to provide information about recent developments and events from the various 
business units straight from the source, YOU!  We need your cooperation and 
participation since EA/EGM/EIM readers want to know more about the Enron 
Americas.  Please help open the door for us by getting your direct reports on 
board and encouraging them to send us news.

Watch for a weekly reminder email, giving upcoming newsletter deadlines.  The 
deadline for the next newsletter is noon, Wednesday, December 13.    If you 
need assistance formatting your business highlights, Kathie Grabstald, the 
newsletter writer, will help turn your bullet points into paragraphs.

Sincerely,
Michelle Vitrella & Kathie Grabstald



I have been asked to pass on newletter items for ENA Legal to EnTouch.   It 
is a weekly newsletter with a Wednesday 12 noon deadline.  

If you have an item of interest to include please send me the pertinent

with.

Well, I am pleased to report that we have our first counterparty that is 
willing to sign both the enovate Master and GISB as is.  Jeff - I will 
overnight the duplicate originals provided by Oneok to your attention.  Would 
you please initial the signature lines and have your assistant return them to 
me?  I will get Laura's signature and forward them on to Oneok.

Thanks - Gregg

More than half of the outstanding assignments are purchase contracts with no 
delivery exposure as well.  I agreed with Chip Hollands to reduce the gty by 
100MM.  I believe the original was 275MM, with 50MM-75MM allocated to the 
indemnity?  He will have their attorneys contact you with the amendment.  
Once Bryce completes  his valuation, we will be able to determine if further 
reductions are possible.  Please call if you have questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that 
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are 
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these 
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a 
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery 
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are 
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated 
with the unassigned, active contracts.

Thanks for your help,
Tanya

The deals that we have in our system are not inclusive of gas daily daily 
deals or deals at index.  These deals are all in our physical sytems but are 
not at a fixed price,  therefore have no forward mark to market value.  These 
are the deals that are not evergreen deals.

I am somewhat unclear as to how we got from the 300 or so contracts that have 
not been assigned per Cyndie's list below to 3?  Does that mean all the other 
contracts have rolled off? Guadalupe Power Partners LP looks like one that 
has not rolled off that was a huge term sale with considerable delivery 
risk.  Are all of the deals on Cyndie's list index deals? Let's chat tomorrow.

CES Transactions (Deal Extract) 10/1/00 - forward
(Please note, there are several transactions for which consent has not been 
received that are flagged as evergreen in Sitara and as such represent a 
"rolling" CES transaction and as such exposure until consent for assignment 
is received or until the transaction/contract is terminated. I have 
highlighted these transaction in green.)

Please find attached a first draft of the following documents relating to the 
Canadian form of EEI master agreement:

1.  Clean copy of Canadianized EEI base contract
2.  Copy of the Candianized EEI base contract, blacklined to show the changes 
to the US form
3.  Canadianized schedules to the EEI contract, including only the three 
products previously included in the industrial power master
4.  Form of EEI Cover Sheet, including the porposed changes to the Canadian 
form of base contract that Enron Canada would include as part thereof

I will develop over the next while a set of situation specific riders that 
Enron Canada can use, similar to those riders developed by ENA.

Please provide me with any comments you may have with respect to these 
documents.  I understand that Chris has a fair amount of pressure on him to 
table our proposed form of the Canadianized EEI documents to the Ontario 
drafting group before their next meeting on November 22.

Article II of the NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT entered in connection with the 
sale of HPL to AEP (which closed as of June 1,2001) provides:

 "ENA [for 3 months post-close] will not  solicit, negotiate or enter into 
any contract, agreement or arrangement for the purchase of natural gas on the 
HPL Pipeline from any Person which is a supplier or producer of natural gas 
connected to the HPL Facilities; provided, however, nothing herein shall be 
construed or interpreted as prohibiting ENA from entering into any such 
contract, agreement or arrangement which is less than one month in duration 
and involves or is related to an Enron Online transaction." 

 This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much 
negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the  original scope 
proposed by AEP.  Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any 
solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our 
limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months.  There are 
many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation 
between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the 
risks and rewards of "stepping too close to or over the line".

Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only 
applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if 
there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian 
Redmond and me.

Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need 
to be aware of this limited restriction.

Sincerely
 BNG

Barbara,
 This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have

space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th

How are you/maybe one day the OSU football coach will know how to deal with 
that team from the north!  I'm in a group at ees that is gradually 
progressing towards a contract briefing system; once we decide on the 
software and system ( i went to a global contract presentation which didn't 
bring back only bad memories!).  I know that we will end up with a similar 
document to what was used (and is still used i believe) in ENA with some 
differences due to the disparate types of customers.   Do you have a word 
version (even an older document would be fine) of that template?   I 
understand that now the ENA briefing system is 'online'.

Roy, attached are the proposed guarantee formats as reviewed by our

Although one of the guarantees states $1MM, I am still trying to get a firm
amount considering the fluctuations in prices and ensuring the March 31
termination date is OK.

We appreciate hearing from you very soon.

Currently we still have 289 active (meaning not terminated) unassigned CES 
contracts. As far as those with transactions, only 74 of the 289 have 
'active' deals. Currently, or as I understand the situation, Porter & Hedges 
(CES's legal counsel for CES Wholesale) is still driving the consent process 
for CES, we are not in the driver's seat.
 An additional note; many of the outstanding consents are with Appalachian 
producers who may never actually execute a consent based on the 
characteristics of the 'customer'.
As far as any future steps that Enron may chose to execute; I am prepared to 
help in anyway I can.

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that 
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are 
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these 
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a 
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery 
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are 
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated 
with the unassigned, active contracts.

Thanks for your help,
Tanya

The deals that we have in our system are not inclusive of gas daily daily 
deals or deals at index.  These deals are all in our physical sytems but are 
not at a fixed price,  therefore have no forward mark to market value.  These 
are the deals that are not evergreen deals.

I am somewhat unclear as to how we got from the 300 or so contracts that have 
not been assigned per Cyndie's list below to 3?  Does that mean all the other 
contracts have rolled off? Guadalupe Power Partners LP looks like one that 
has not rolled off that was a huge term sale with considerable delivery 
risk.  Are all of the deals on Cyndie's list index deals? Let's chat tomorrow.

Thanks,
Tanya

Attached is a spreadsheet which tracks the CES non-assigned contracts. This 
spreadsheet is current as of 12/04/00. I have also attached a 10/01/00 deal 
extract showing all deals in Sitara that still carried the CES prefix (which 
is used to denote non-assigned deals), this report was originally pulled from 
Sitara for Tanya Rohauer. Please call me at 713.853.1443 if I can be of any 
further assistance.

ENA - Global Contracts




CES Transactions (Deal Extract) 10/1/00 - forward
(Please note, there are several transactions for which consent has not been 
received that are flagged as evergreen in Sitara and as such represent a 
"rolling" CES transaction and as such exposure until consent for assignment 
is received or until the transaction/contract is terminated. I have 
highlighted these transaction in green.)

Gary,

In preparation for the Outlook migration, we have come up with the basic 
structure of the public folders needed for EWS Legal.  The initial access to 
create and/or rename folders should be given to the users identified next to 
the group and/or subgroup (i.e. for Enron Global Markets - grant access to 
Alan Aronowitz and Nita Garcia).   Upon completion of the migration, the 
assistant assigned to each of these groups will procure access to others in 
her group and create additional folders as they may be needed.

Please let us know if you have any questions regarding the attached 
information.

Thanks.

Janette Elbertson and Nony Flores

Thanks.  I will sit down with accounting and go through the math on that 
basis and let you know if it seems all is in order.  If we send a letter in

Cyndie.

Thanks so much for your quick response.  Are the other 215 'master' type 
contracts?  I would agree that the Appalachian deals probably won't get 
assigned - these are John Singer's I believe.  I am really only concerned 
about those contracts where we are selling gas.  To the extent that you can 
help Bryce Baxter determine which of those unasssigned deals are sales so he 
can quantify the delivery risk, I would greatly appreciate it.  Jeff, I 
assume that the 215 that do not have deals are really defunct, since all new 
deals would be done on ENA paper?

Currently we still have 289 active (meaning not terminated) unassigned CES 
contracts. As far as those with transactions, only 74 of the 289 have 
'active' deals. Currently, or as I understand the situation, Porter & Hedges 
(CES's legal counsel for CES Wholesale) is still driving the consent process 
for CES, we are not in the driver's seat.
 An additional note; many of the outstanding consents are with Appalachian 
producers who may never actually execute a consent based on the 
characteristics of the 'customer'.
As far as any future steps that Enron may chose to execute; I am prepared to 
help in anyway I can.

Subject: Re: CES

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that 
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are 
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these 
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a 
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery 
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are 
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated 
with the unassigned, active contracts.

Thanks for your help,

The deals that we have in our system are not inclusive of gas daily daily 
deals or deals at index.  These deals are all in our physical sytems but are 
not at a fixed price,  therefore have no forward mark to market value.  These 
are the deals that are not evergreen deals.

I am somewhat unclear as to how we got from the 300 or so contracts that have 
not been assigned per Cyndie's list below to 3?  Does that mean all the other 
contracts have rolled off? Guadalupe Power Partners LP looks like one that 
has not rolled off that was a huge term sale with considerable delivery 
risk.  Are all of the deals on Cyndie's list index deals? Let's chat tomorrow.

Attached is a spreadsheet which tracks the CES non-assigned contracts. This 
spreadsheet is current as of 12/04/00. I have also attached a 10/01/00 deal 
extract showing all deals in Sitara that still carried the CES prefix (which 
is used to denote non-assigned deals), this report was originally pulled from 
Sitara for Tanya Rohauer. Please call me at 713.853.1443 if I can be of any 
further assistance.

CES Transactions (Deal Extract) 10/1/00 - forward
(Please note, there are several transactions for which consent has not been 
received that are flagged as evergreen in Sitara and as such represent a 
"rolling" CES transaction and as such exposure until consent for assignment 
is received or until the transaction/contract is terminated. I have 
highlighted these transaction in green.)

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of the Master Electric 
Services and Sales Agm we've been talking about.  As discussed with Mike, I 
used a combination of the Master Form that Mike has been circulating to the 
business teams... and Mike's version of the Home Depot draft.  I've also 
incorporated certain provisions that Wal-Mart asked to include in the gas 
contract that Marianne Castano drafted.  You will see a number of provisions 
bracketed and bold.  Pls give me your thoughts on those and
Wal-Mart does not like arbitration and we deleted it in the gas contract.  
Have talked with Bob Williams our Enron Corp litig expert and says we need to 
hold firm on keeping arbitration if at all possible.   Have kept arbitration 
in the draft.
Mike S. and Jeff, Wal-Mart has the following standard provision it likes to 
include:  "Non-Interference:   In exercising EESI's rights herein, we shall 
not unreasonably interfere with your operations."   Normally we avoid such 
broad provisions but we agreed to include in the draft gas contract and draft 
metering agreement.  I did not add this to the draft.  Thoughts?
MIke S. and Jeff, any problems with keeping the Mutual Indemnity, Walmart 
asked for indemnity in gas contract and we agreed to include one.
Mike S. and Jeff, any problems with Severability provision?
 Mike H. and Angela, do you want the Add Delete and Substitution provisions 
that are in the draft (same as HD),
Walmart asked that we add a provision saying we'll use comm. reas. efforts to 
mitigate Penalties in the Operational Change provision, I will add this to 
the next draft.

Pls advise who at the Desk this draft should go to.

Below are the clean version, the blackline against Mike's HD draft and the 
blackline against the Master form that Mike circulated to the business team 
and lawyers 6-4.

Mary, sorry for not getting back to you soooner.

Of the three concepts, only (i) Market Opening condition is proving sellable, 
and then only on the basis the it is bilateral and for physical 
transactions.  The other 2 concepts:  (ii) modified Market Disruption; or 
(iii) suspension of obligations if Enron is subject to 
judicial/regulatory/legislative action (intended to address Project Stanley), 
are proving to be unworkable concepts.  I believe these latter 2 issues and 
Market Opening Risk for financials will be resolved commercially as something 
that will be lived with.  The traders/marketers have all three concepts 
however.

With repsect to the summary of deals that may be subject to Market Disruption 
as a result of changing legislation or Pool Rules, as we previously 
discussed, I am not sure where that work product was going, other than 
somebody (I believe Lavo) wanted the summary for information purposes (i.e. 
as the deals were already done, the risk is what it is).  If there is some 
other impetus for your report and I need to do something further, please let 
me know.

Many thanks for all of the hard and thoughtful work.

Peter.

Subject: Canadian Power Confirms



	

Attached is a redraft of the three proposed points for inclusion in each of 
financial and physical power confirms.  Please review and advise of any 
further comments or thoughts.  

It is my understanding that it has been decided that Canada wants to negate 
Market Disruption concepts on the basis of changes to EUA or Pool rules.  I 
have also negated force majeure claims on the same basis (typically not apt 
in financial--however, since it could be argued I added it in the financial 
confirm language as well).  Question:  Would we also want to add "any other 
excuse of performance" to this concept?  Such language would afford a broader 
sweep in respect of various claims, however, (i) the sweep may be too broad 
in light of it covering any change in the EUA or Pool rules and (ii) 
ultimately, we may want some flexibility to argue other points.   Advise.

Under Performance Suspension the intent is to carve out the "trade" for 
suspension, while leaving the other aspects of the masters/gtcs in place, 
such as bankruptcy and other termination events.

Mary

Jeff Hodge will be out of the office beginning at noon tomorrow through next 
week.  If you have any issues that need to be discussed with him this week, 
please let me know, and I will coordinate an EES/EWS meeting with Jeff

Sandi,

I am told that you were the person responsible for drafting the confirmations 
for the Producer One finder's fee and that you will no longer be performing 
this function. I am trying to find out who in legal will be responsible for 
drafting these in the future.  As far as my records show, we have sent a 
confirmation to Alcorn, and we still need to prepare a confirmation for the 
Dale Resources deal.

Do you have the records that identify what deals that have been confirmed for 
Finder's fees?  Do you know who will be taking over this function?

I appreciate any help that you can provide.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Janet,
 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse 
requirements"?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about 
this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is 
provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm 
desk using a standard    GTC confirm.

A little forward movement trying to get the Global Counterparty not to set up 
counterparties under division or trade names.  If the counterparties insist 
on doing so, we have been trying to get them to add the legal name as part of 
the counterparty's name in GCP.   For non-swap team members, you may want to 
forward this email on to your groups as well.

		 Subject: Counterparty Name Conventions


In accordance with the suggestions provided by Mary Cook in our Legal Dept., 
we have come to an agreement in regard to the naming conventions for 
divisions and trade names. For both divisions and dba/trade names, the 
counterparty name will be formatted to lead with the sub-entity name, 
followed by the parent legal name.

 i.e. division name, division of parent legal name  or  trade name, a dba of 
parent legal name

 Ex. Duke Power, a division of Duke Energy Corporation

This layout will make it easier to choose the correct counterparty name and 
avoid the misconception of duplicate records. Also the legal requirements 
will be met.

Please notify me by Friday, June 8th, if there are any issues with this 
format. Otherwise, the GCP group will commence using this proposed layout on 
current and future requests. 

Cleanup of existing records in GCP and Contracts will be accessed. In cases 
where the requested name could exceed the 90 character length maximum there 
will need to be an evaluation.

If there are any questions, please contact me @ 3-6517.

Thank you,
Marilyn

Attached is a memo regarding my discussions with OGE and the revised Master 
and GISB agreements.

 - GISB Spec Prov - enovate L.L.C..doc

I am also including their comments to our form of guarantee (they have no 
revisions other than entity and amount) and their proposed form of guarantee.

 - Enron Guaranty (from Master).doc - to enovate, llc.doc

Let me know what you think.

Thanks - Gregg

See attached.  It turns out Houston does not provide c/p identifications to 
Inside FERC.

Jeff, many thanks.  Peter.

Peter:

Attached you will find a sample of what ENA submits to Inside FERC.  As you 
can see, it is a download from EOL and does not include counterparty names.

I trust this is of some help to you in your current situation.

Barbara,
 This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have 
any thoughts.

Our department will be migrated to Outlook in two groups.  The first group 
will be migrated on Monday, June 11,  and the second group will be migrated 
on Tuesday, June 12.   You will receive four e-mails from the Outlook 
migration team.  Please do not delete them.  You will need to open the four 
e-mails and follow the instructions to migrate to Outlook.

Assistants, you will be responsible for scheduling training for yourself and 
your assignments.  It is recommended everyone attend a one hour training 
class.  Training can be scheduled by contacting Maggie Cruz at extension 
3-1816.  (Assistants, please coordinate training with your backup so both of 
you are not in training at the same time.)  Outlook migration specialists 
will be on the 38th floor to answer questions Tuesday and Wednesday, June 12 
and 13.

Listed below is useful information provided to us by the Outlook Migration 
team.  

E-mail Policies

Users will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  

Further mailbox size restrictions are detailed as follows:

Issue Warning at 75 MB - users are automatically sent a warning from the 
System Administrator explaining they are near their Mailbox limit.

Prohibit Send at 100 MB - users are prevented from sending e-mail, yet they 
can still receive internal and external messages.  Users must reduce the size 
of their mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, 
etc. before they can send e-mail again.   

Inbound/Outbound Mail Size Limits - inbound and outbound e-mail messages will 
be limited to a size of 10MB.

Deleted Item Retention - users will be able to recover deleted items from 
their mailbox as old as 8 days.  Deleted items include e-mail messages, 
folders, contacts, calendar entries, tasks, notes, journal entries and 
meeting notices.

Archiving - archiving will not be a supported feature of Outlook 2000. 

Migration Preparation

Clean Your Mailbox - due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are 
advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE 
migration.  If you are at the 100MB limit on the day of migration, you will 
not be able to send messages once you are in Outlook.

Limits on Items Migrated  - from the day of your migration, only 30 days of 
old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your 
inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of 
migration will be migrated (with the exception of repeating appointments).

Thanks for the update on status.   As Tom and I discussed we've made 
revisions to the draft anticipating a deal based on the new price structure 
and wanted to circulate this for internal review.  The blackline below shows 
the changes to the last draft that we sent to the customer.   If you have any 
comments, please let us know.  Assume we will revise the draft as necessary 
after your mtg.  Good luck!   M3

Wanted to update you on the timing and status.  We (Greg, Mark and I) will be 
meeting with the participants late next week to discuss our deal in person 
and answer questions.  Looks like we are still talking a wholesale index plus 
basis deal with a collar.

They may forward some comments about the contract in general in advance of 
our meeting.  If so, we will forward to you to discuss prior to the meeting.

Mark and Jeff,

The Paper & Pulp desk has a customer that they would like to put into a three 
year financial deal; however, the credit profile of the customer would 
require hefty upfront security.  At the same time, they would like to enter 
into a contract wherein ENA purchases all of their production (newsprint) at 
index prices.  ENA's payable to this company could run to 10MM/ month.  Can 
we draft a netting arrangement that would allow us to net the physical and 
financial exposures in the event of a default so that the customer would not 
be required to post security for the financial deal?  I think we may have 
done something along these lines for a couple of Fred Lagrasta's customers.  
I am comfortable that the purchase payable will more than offset the 
potential financial exposure, but want to ensure that you are comfortable 
that the ability to net these two exposures can be assured through a 
contract.  Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Tanya
