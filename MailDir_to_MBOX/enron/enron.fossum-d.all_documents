Congratulations to you both!  Your designation as V.Ps. is richly deserved!  
Just among us "constrained technical" people, however,  couldn't they have 
come up with a better description of our category?  It makes us sound like we 
are deficient in something other than just career choice!  See you 
soon--beers are on me!  DF

Enron Not Looking for New Business M&A in 2000

    Enron does not expect any mergers or acquisitions of new business and i=

not interested in selling its pipelines. Enron will seek opportunities to
fill-in its businesses with asset purchases, rather  than purchasing new
businesses. It will be giving a detailed view of its telecommunications
business at an analysts meeting in Houston today. Enron says Europe, Latin
America=01,s southern cone and Japan provide great opportunity. Enron=01,s =

enter the European market. EnronOnline, the global Internet-based transacti=

system for wholesale energy and other commodities, will soon allow it to
reduce back-office costs in a transaction substantially. In addition to bei=

will create an environment where a buyer or seller of natural gas or power
will be able to more easily, with a computer mouse click, process complex
power and natural gas transactions.

Attached are my notes from the session with the Alliance for Energy suppliers 
held today at Reliant's offices.  You'll see from the notes that this effort 
isn't going anywhere fast.  Nonetheless, I thought you would be interested in 
the market intelligence of how other pipelines, particularly Tennessee, are 
dealing with the generators.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=

Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20

Subject: TW Capacity Options meeting

Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill 
Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members 
of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.

 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention 
that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit 
ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be 
posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.

 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be 
determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include 
an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.

 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a 
shipper exercises its call option.

 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission 
policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy 
altogether.

 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages 
for nonperformance.

 6.  Timeline:
  - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)
  - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service 
  - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a 
producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)
  - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require 
Board approval at Enron)
  - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)
  - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)

If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to 
get a new draft out by next Friday a.m.

Shit--I knew I forgot something!  My boss leaves for good on April one, so 
I'll be spending 3 or so days a wk in Hou starting now.  I'll be the VP and 
General Counsel of Enron Transportation Services, which is the division that 
runs all the pipelines.  Yeeha.  I agree about getting together--when you 
coming down to visit the sister in law?  Maybe we can run up to MPLS for a 
boondoggle.  Also, I'll be in DC the 22d and 23d of March--where are you?  DF

I think it is important to get estimates from the litigation group and from 
outside counsel on major matters. I am not going to lose any sleep if we dont 
get something on the Grynberg/Quinque cases from outside counsel because 
frankly there has not been a lot of activity and our fractional share of 
joint bills for matters would be relatively small.

Why would this be any different from TW operatiing the Blanco line for NW? We 
would need to put together a joint budget between Operations and Market 
Services exactly as we do for NW?

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

I had an interesting conversation with Mark Courtney today, this time about 
something that doesn't cost us money.  He has gained a good bit of experience 
on transmission availability in NW New Mexico from the Gallup electric 
contract negotiation.  His take on transmission constraints is consistent 
with what Kevin and I had suspected:  Alb. is a load pocket and the 
prevailing flow is west to east into Alb.  Constraints only affect west to 
east flows and a generator in Alb. could always move power to four corners by 
displacement.  Courtney has worked with an ENA transmission guy named Steve 
Walton who apparently has more experience with the 230Kv transmission lines 
that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in Alb.  If we are not 
talking to him already, he would be another guy worth talking to.

How much time did you say you will have????  If you can get through  a tenth 
of that in 5 minutes, you are much quicker than I!  Also, in an amazing 
coincidence, your outline looks very similar to MKM's speech for the Canuck 
gas conference next week.  Good job on both!  DF

Subject: February 10 Meeting with Dan Larcamp and Team


Lorraine Cross has invited me to participate in an "outreach meeting" with 
Dan Larcamp and his team on February 10.  Also participating in the outreach 
meeting will be Williams (Judy Neason/Scott Turkington); El Paso (Peggy Heeg) 
and Coastal (Dan Collins).    

The meeting comes at Larcamp's request and is part of a series of outreach 
meetings that OMTR is having with other industry groups including producers, 
gas and electric utilities and marketers.

The purpose of the meeting is not to discuss positions in the current gas 
NOPR (as OMTR is assuming that the 
Commission will take action on the gas NOPR in February).  The purpose of the 
meeting is discuss how markets are changing and talk about upcoming 
regulatory issues.

There will be no formal presentations or slides.  Lorraine will give a 5 
minute overview on INGAA's themes on regulatory policy (these theme's are per 
the Board of Directors' Task Force on FERC Policy):

Competition 
Re-contracting challenges
Rate discounting

Each of the four participating companies will have 5 minutes to relate their 
pipeline experiences to these themes.  I would propose to focus my remarks on 
topic of the continuous contracting state of the pipeline capacity market.  
The point is to tell Larcamp that we are not looking for a regulatory answer 
to this short-term, continuous contracting environment.  What we are seeking 
is the rate and service flexibility we need to meet these challenges.  
Examples will be the new services flexibility that we continue to seek on TW 
(Enhanced Firm Backhaul, Limited Firm).  And, the pricing changes we seek on 
NNG, including seasonal rates.  Again, I don't plan to have any formal 
slides, but here is the outline of the message.  I would also propose to add 
some specific examples/data on capacity release, recent auction experiences 
and re-contracting statistics.



FYI: 

El Paso plans to talk about the role that negotiated rate transactions will 
increasingly play in the market place, citing their experiences in placing El 
Paso capacity and their negotiated rate contract extensions on Tenn/E. Tenn.

Williams tentatively plans to talk about additional flexibility on offshore 
pipelines, about the need for more self-implementing flexibility, and the 
impacts of regulatory delay.


Please let me know by Monday, February 7 is you have any concerns about the 
general direction of my remarks or about any other issues that you would have 
me bring up with Larcamp and team.

As you were aware, we were evaluating the possibility of filing an interim 
fuel filing with hopes the fuel percentages would be decreased and we would 
be able to capture the upside with the high gas prices.   After completing 
the data and computations, we are sorry to report that the majority of the 
rates actually increase.  This incorporated use of the same over(under) 
factors from last years PRA.   So no filing will be made.  
What the info did tell us is 1)  fuel burned is comparable to last year but 
the throughput utilized was down therefore causing an increase in the rate,  
2)  UAF is up compared to last year and at this time the rate actually 
doubles .15 to .33  3)  we need to factor this into our plans for 2001.  If 
anyone wants to review the detail please let us know.    Mary Kay

Subject: LRC Joint Venture

Please find the attached memo summarizing a proposed joint venture between 
Enron North America and Texaco involving our respective intrastate pipeline 
assets in Louisiana (i.e., Enron's LRC pipeline).  The joint venture would 
restrict Enron and its affiliates from pursuing certain limited business 
opportunities involving specified pipeline assets that may be competitive 
with the joint venture.  Specifically, these assets include: 

(i) the Acadian Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
Petroleum Inc. USA), 
(ii) the Cypress Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
Petroleum Inc. USA), 
(iii) the Louisiana Intrastate Gas System (currently ultimately owned by 
American Electric Power Co. Inc.), 
(iv) the Louisiana Gas System (currently ultimately owned by Conoco Inc.); 
and 
(v) the Louisiana gas pipeline assets of Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. (currently 
ultimately owned by Koch Industries).  

In keeping with Enron's internal policies, we are seeking your confirmation

Don't know why I didn't think to look in Secretariat:

http://home.enron.com:84/secretariat/CDS12547.htm


It's currently a sub of Transwestern Pipeline Company.   Is this the best 
positioning for legal/regulatory purposes?  I liked your idea, Drew, of 
having it be a sub of Enron Pipeline Company.

If it's a sub of TW, it'll get disclosed in the TW Form 2.  I don't know 
whether that's a concern for you.

I understand that you guys have retained Holland and Hart to give us another 
set of eyes on the Navajo issues.  For future reference, I have finally 
hooked up with the South Dakota firm I mentioned and was favorably impressed 
with their experience in similar matters.  Don Schultz and a couple of his 
partners have substantial litigation experience both for and against the S.D. 
tribes (Ogalla Sioux, etc.) on federal jurisdictional issues.  One of Don's 
partners is general counsel of the Rushmore Electric Cooperative in Western 
South Dakota and has had dealings with the tribes on right of way issues for 
years.   They have cleared conflicts, and are available  if we ever need a 
third opinion or if we get into a spat with the tribes elsewhere.  Sorry it 
took me so long to run this to ground.  Thanks. DF

Effective immediately, Joe Jeffers, Manager of Technical Training and Skill 
Based Pay Administration, and his team of Dick Heitman, Cliff McPherson, 
Andrea Woody and Lupi Trevino will move from ETS Human Resources to ETS 
Operations Technical Services.  Joe will report to Steve Klimesh.  

This move will better align Technical Training and SBP Administration with 
Operations and enhance the interfaces that take place between this group and 
ETS Operations management and the field teams. 

Joe and his team have provided outstanding support to Operations in the past, 
and it is expected that this high standard of customer service will 
continue.  We will be sending more information in the very near future with 
regard to the individual support accountabilities of the team members.  

Please join me in welcoming this team and helping to make their transition a 
smooth one.

Ugh.  We'll keep working this angle if their new attorney shows up on deck, 
but I think Susan and I have done as much as can be done with Howard H.  Do 
any of you know what the Red Cedar facilities look like?  I.e. how many miles 
of line, any big diameter line, any compression, etc?  Howard must have read 
some old cases and gotten himself spooked that their facilites aren't 
gathering under the modified primary function test.  I'm not sure why he 
thinks signing a transport contract with us will make their situation any 
worse, but that seems to be his conclusion.  If Steve and Bill can't nudge 
Red Cedar's management into doing the deal, I'd suggest that you both or one 
of you ask Tsuri (sp?) to have his new lawyer call me and Susan after Howard 
leaves, maybe with one of the Kinder Morgan lawyers on the phone also, and 
we'll try to straighten this out.

I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation 
with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder 
Morgan lawyers.

TNPC Wins Pennsylvania Customers, Continues to Go Green
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

TNPC, Inc., parent of The New Power Company, reported that the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission approved the "Competitive Default Service Agreeme=
nt"
between The New Power Company and PECO Energy for almost 300,000 customers.
The PUC is expected to issue a final order on this matter in the next few
days.

ANALYSIS: As you may recall, a dispute erupted between TNPC and Green Mount=
ain
about a month ago over this large number of customers in PECO Energy's
service territory. Under a regulatory mandate from the Pennsylvania PUC,
PECO had initiated an auction for the approximately 300,000 residential
electricity customers who had not selected a competitive energy service
provider registered within the state. This represented about 20 percent
of PECO's residential customer base. Three energy providers=01*TNPC, Green
Mountain and one other unidentified company=01*bid for the customers with
various service packages. PECO chose TNPC, which had offered a fixed discou=
nt
of 2 percent for the residential customers, because it believed the offer
was in the best interest of PECO customers.

Green Mountain contested this decision, arguing that its hydro- and natural
gas-based energy package would ultimately be "less expensive for consumers
and environmentally cleaner." Green Mountain also claimed that its proposed
offer was a full 2 percent less than PECO's shopping credit, compared to
TNPC's offer which would average about 1.83 percent below the shopping
credit. PECO's response was that Green Mountain had missed the deadline
for the auction and consequently did not present a valid offer. Over the
last month, both Green Mountain and TNPC fought hard for PECO's customers,
which was understandable as Pennsylvania represents arguably the most=20
successful
retail market in the United States, if not the world.

The PUC ruling clearly puts the 300,000 PECO customers into the hands of
TNPC, which of course is the product of the residential retail marketing
alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM. Securing the 300,000 residential=20
customers
in one swift motion is a significant achievement for TNPC and gives it
a substantial market edge over other energy service providers in the=20
Pennsylvania
market. The customers will be randomly selected from those that have not
shopped for an alternative supplier under the state's electric competition
program.

However, what I find most interesting about the latest development in this
case is what's happening behind the scenes of the dispute, and more=20
specifically
how TNPC continues to move toward a renewables perspective. I discussed
just two weeks ago (IssueAlert from Nov. 13) that TNPC's stock (NYSE: NPW)
was taking a nosedive. Keep in mind that the stock had a terrific IPO in
early October. TNPC's IPO offering of 24 million common shares was priced
at $21 per share, a surprisingly strong showing for a company that has
only been in existence since May of this year. Momentum grew as the first
day of trading saw the stock price climb to $27.  Yet, contrast that with
the current stock price of $6 3/8 (as of Nov. 30), and certainly questions
about where TNPC will go from here start to emerge. The decline in TNPC
stock seemed to start when the company reported a 3Q loss of $69.9 million,
or $2.96 per share. TNPC argued that the losses were not meaningful due
its limited operating history, but investors seemed to think otherwise.


Around the same time that TNPC's stock began to drop, the company announced
that it would be adding wind-generated energy to its package for customers
in the Philadelphia area. Under terms of a brand-new agreement, TNPC will
market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under developmen=
t
in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania. My reaction to this announcemen=
t
was that TNPC's addition of wind power to its portfolio was an attempt
to quell further objections from Green Mountain. Yet, TNPC's move toward
renewable energy now appears to be an attempt to save its sagging stock
price.

In another ironic twist, TNPC also announced that it is forming a partnersh=
ip
with Green Mountain, which was an adversary only last month. TNPC disclosed
that it is in negotiations with Green Mountain regarding the disposition
of up to 50,000 competitive default service customers (out of the 300,000)
within PECO's territory. Reportedly, the relationship will benefit=20
Pennsylvania
consumers and help TNPC and Green Mountain to achieve their business goals.
In addition, TNPC claims that working with Green Mountain in this manner
is consistent with its objective of enhancing a "positive customer portfoli=
o
value." However, considering that TNPC fought so hard to obtain all of
the 300,000 customers from PECO, it seems odd that the company would sudden=
ly
be willing to share 50,000 of them with Green Mountain.

Certainly, Green Mountain wins from this partnership. The company gains
50,000 residential customers when it, based on the PUC's ruling, could
have ended up with nothing. The company offers three service packages in
Pennsylvania: EcoSmart, EnviroBlend and Nature's Choice, varying mixes
of hydro, natural gas and new renewables, with Nature's Choice containing
more renewables than the other two power blends. Marketing power that it
bills as "dramatically cleaner than typical Pennsylvania electricity,"
Green Mountain may be able to expand its reach in the state by attracting
energy customers who seek out environmentally clean energy.

What remains very unclear is TNPC's true motivations and the future of
the company, which made such a big splash when it began operating last
spring. Is this a classic case of an energy start-up chasing down trends
(e.g., the current high value of renewable energy stocks) in order to=20
rejuvenate
itself, or a true identity transformation? The questions are pertinent
as long as TNPC continues to generate losses and its stock continues to
struggle.

Duke, Williams to Buy Gulfstream from Coastal Corporation
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their intent to jointly
purchase The Coastal Corporation's 100-percent interest in the Gulfstream
Natural Gas System project. The purchase, expected to be finalized by the
end of this year, is subject to federal regulatory approvals and conditione=
d
upon completion of the Coastal / El Paso Energy Corporation merger. Financi=
al
terms of the purchase were not disclosed.

ANALYSIS: The Gulfstream project is a proposed 744-mile steel pipeline
designed specifically to deliver natural gas into Florida. The project
has been sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp., a $16 billion=20
Houston-based
energy holding company with operations in natural-gas production, distribut=
ion
and marketing. Coastal Corp. is presently waiting for FERC's approval to
build and operate the system. However, due to regulatory mandates related
to Coastal Corp.'s pending merger with El Paso Energy Corp., Coastal Corp.
was forced by the Federal Trade Commission to divest the project. As a
result, Duke Energy and Williams have found a good window of opportunity
to purchase the pipeline project and its valuable inroad to the Florida
market. Until the merger is complete, Coastal Corp. will continue to develo=
p
and market Gulfstream.

According to Coastal, the $1.6 billion Gulfstream project has already achie=
ved
two important milestones in its FERC approval process: preliminary=20
determination
on non-environmental issues and a favorable draft environmental impact
statement. The company anticipates that the project will receive full FERC
approval in the first quarter 2001 and that Gulfstream will become fully
operational in June 2002. Approximately 400 miles of the route, which=20
originates
in Mobile, Ala., crosses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal
offshore waters. Gulfstream offers 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural-gas
capacity per day, and is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities
and power-generation facilities that plan on using high-efficiency natural-=
gas
turbines. Already, the project has precedent agreements with 10 large Flori=
da
utilities and power generation facilities.

Upon completion of the purchase, Duke and Williams will proceed with the
jointly managed operation and development of the Gulfstream project. It's
not difficult to assess why Duke and Williams would be interested in making
the acquisition. The two companies, which have historically had a=20
collaborative
relationship, already own significant amounts of interstate natural-gas
pipeline capacity. Between its two subsidiaries involved in natural-gas
production=01*Duke Energy Field Services and Duke Energy Gas Transmission=
=01*Duke
Energy owns and operates about 57,000 miles of pipeline and 12,000 intersta=
te
miles of capacity. Williams' five interstate natural gas pipelines reported=
ly
deliver about 16 percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States.
The company's vast 27,300-mile pipeline network stretches from coast to
coast and from Mexico to Canada, serving more than 48 million residential,
commercial and industrial natural gas users. In fact, the two companies
already were planning the Buccaneer Gas Pipeline project in Florida, a
674-mile pipeline that would have followed a similar route as the Gulfstrea=
m
project will follow. Duke and Williams are no longer planning the Buccaneer
project now that they are acquiring the Gulfstream project. The addition
of Gulfstream should benefit both companies and offer a prime position
for them to expand their independent operations in Florida.

The CEO of Williams' gas pipeline group stated that the Florida market
would support only one new pipeline coming into the state. By joining=20
together,
Williams and Duke can both capitalize on the high-growth state as it=20
eventually
becomes competitive. First among the priorities for the project is to ensur=
e
adequate pipeline capacity by June 2002, and meeting the projected 10,000
MW electric generation growth that is expected by 2007.

Duke Energy also confirmed that the purchase of the Gulfstream project
accelerates its own entry into Florida. In fact, Richard Priory, Duke's
CEO, conceded at a conference last September that much of Duke's future
success will result from its natural-gas operations. Specifically, Duke
has been focused on merchant plant and natural-gas pipeline construction
for some time. As of this summer, Duke was rated third in announced merchan=
t
plants (behind Calpine and Panda), and has made no bones about the fact
that its strategy is centered around building additional merchant plants
and acquiring natural-gas pipelines. Thus, the acquisition of Gulfstream
is a perfectly appropriate move for the company to make.

And the strategy is resulting in some significant payoffs for the company.
Duke's third-quarter earnings rose 75 percent. Duke attributed the higher
results to the continued expansion of its unregulated energy businesses,
specifically natural-gas gathering and foreign energy sales. Duke's shares,
which had been trading at 52-week peaks, are currently trading at $88 15/16
(as of the opening of the market on Nov. 20). Current market conditions
certainly validate Duke's growth in this direction. For starters, current
data indicate that natural gas is the fuel of choice for approximately
90 percent of all new electric generation that is being built. Most=20
projections
place natural gas as the ongoing fuel of choice for new generation as the
demand for natural gas is expected to increase from 23 trillion to 30 trill=
ion
cubic feet per year by 2010. In addition, coal and nuclear generation came
under environmental and public scrutiny over the last two decades, at a
time when natural-gas prices were comparatively low. All of these factors
have created a strong market for natural-gas generation, despite the fact
that data from the Department of Energy suggests a shortage of natural
gas and heating oil for this winter.

Duke has had a rather difficult time penetrating the Florida market, so
this purchase could facilitate easier expansion in the state. About a year
ago, the Florida Public Service Commission had approved the construction
of a Duke merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach. However, the state's three
IOUs appealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that merch=
ant
plants were not allowed under state law. The Florida Supreme Court overturn=
ed
the decision of the state PSC, blocking Duke's entry into the state.=20
Consequently,
Duke is wisely using the acquisition of the Gulfstream project as another
way to get into the Florida market (and one that is potentially more=20
profitable).


Florida has not yet passed restructuring legislation, and it is unclear
when the state will become competitive. Bills have been introduced into
the state legislature, but thorny issues such as stranded cost recovery
and unbundling charges have caused the bills to be removed. Presently,
Governor Jeb Bush has created a 19-member commission to develop an energy
plan for the state. The commission must submit a report to the governor
and the legislature by December 1, 2001. Among the issues that must be
addressed are power reliability, energy supply and delivery, and the fiscal
impacts of deregulation. However, it is clear from the commission's deadlin=
e
that competition will not take effect in Florida during 2001.

Yet, looking forward, if the California experience is any indication, the
natural-gas shortage should work to Duke's advantage. As wholesale prices
skyrocketed this summer, Duke and other generators were in a prime position
to reap large gains. Duke is still following this tactic on the West Coast.
California regulators just gave approval to the construction of a proposed
1,060-MW unit in Monterey County, which again is natural-gas fired, combine=
d
cycle unit. If California history repeats itself in Florida, Duke and Willi=
ams
will be the co-owners of the only new gas pipeline coming into the state
at a time when natural-gas supplies remain quite low.

The Mineral Leasing Act may be the statute that governs--at least I'm 
familiar with it as the statute governing the MMS onshore oil and gas royalty 
program.  There are also statutes that cover hard rock mining rights and 
surface (i.e., grazing) rights.  I'm not sure which one is the basis for 
Greg's theories.   What you guys need is a real dirt lawyer.  Don't we have 
any ex-EOG lawyers around?  There aren't any in ETS that I'm aware of that 
know this stuff.  As to the RFP process, I have even less of an idea.  I hear 
you on your instinct to give him the answer, but one of my goals is to hear 
what MMS thinks its legal basis is for going after storage and forming my own 
view of whether they are right or just blowing smoke.  DF

I am doing some research on statutory authority to try to understand where 
the 12.5% comes from.

Drew,

Any thoughts on where I might go to find out more about the MMS RFP process 
because , if we understand it, we may be able to find a loophole.

I figure if we tell Greg what the answer is, he may be willing to accept it 
as opposed to us asking him to find the answer and relying on his 
interpretation

Subject: Gallup Station - Demand Rebate



Hey Drew,
 
Sorry that we did not get to meet last week when you were in town.  I have 
pulled up some information on the project performance and wanted to share 
with the group.  I was very concerned by the comment that the project was on 
a rate to cost TW an additional $1.0 million for the year because the demand 
avoidance program was not in place.  I do want to confirm that Arnold 
Eisenstein at ET&S working on the development of the programming to support 
TW's efforts to minimize demand expenses.  It was my understanding during the 
development of this project, that TW was targeting a 75% avoidance for an 
annual basis.   I offer the following details regarding the actual operation 
of the station in 2000. 

Peak load for 12,000 hp = 9,621 kw x 3 = 28,864.0 kw per Quarter

Actual Utilization
   3rd Quarter 2000      % of Max  4th Quarter 2000  % of Max
 kw - generation   22,684.8      78.6   17,779       61.6
 kw - transmission 25,421.0      88.1   22,992       79.6
 
 Target $'s @ 75% 99,142      75.0            73,480      75.0
 Net Actual Rebate  $'s 75,935        78.6                105,181        61.59
  difference            ($23,206)                  $31,702   

Overall net for 2000 under Rate 21 appears to reflect that TW has saved 
$8,496 above their target rebate of $170,622 (75% avoidance) for the 3rd and 
4th quarters.  In addition, ECS has made payment to TW under Rate 19 that 
resulted in an additional $118,441 paid to TW.   Note that ECS has proposed 
to included the transmission demand in the Rebate process which is not 
specifically addressed the Compression Service Agreement.  


Currently TW has access to the web site that graphically displays the current 
Tri-State generation load as well as several years of month by month 
history.  This access was conveyed to TW as soon as the confidentiality 
agreement between TW, ECS and Tri-State was executed and delivered to ECS.  
At this point, EE&CC (now under ET&S) was notified that the system access was 
available to package the load monitoring programming.  As I mentioned above, 
that effort is underway.  

I will be glad to meet and/or discuss these issues when you are available.  I 
will be travelling most of the next (2) weeks but you can reach me via email 
or my
cell phone (713) 851-7703.   Based on the information that I was able to pull 
together, I just don't see the magnitude of dollars that seems to have TW 
concerned.
I would like to discuss at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,
mk

I haven't seen a contract yet on the original 33,000 on TW but Susan thought 
the deal was going to be done--she's checking to see where the holdup is.  On 
the El Paso capacity, Mavrix never submitted a bid.  I think the deadline got 
past us before we were ready.  df

2.  Talk to Perry Frazier in planning--he is keeping copies of the actual EBB

posted (the 33,000/d).  I'd like you to keep copies of those postings in your 
file until Mavrix actually buys that capacity.  If we end up in a fight at 
some time, we'll be able to prove the postings were out there, because the 
actual postings are not electronically archived, I am told.
3. All Mavrix deals will need initials from legal--probably you, Susan.  For 
now, please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes.  For 
Enron pipes, of course, contract approval will be via our ordinary procedures 
and MKM's group and I should be advised as a matter of course.  

Thanks.  DF

Maria, please take a look at this list of "Reference Entities" and the 
attached memo.  I doubt we have any reason to knock out any of the listed 
entities based on legal controversies, etc., but its worth a check .  From 
the attached memo, it looks like a more likely reason to disqualify an entity 
would be credit problems or some other commercial issue.  I'm in a bind today 
and out the rest of the week so it would be helpful if you could pick this 
ball up in my absence.   Please get back to me and Mike with the results of 
your analysis.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: TW March 31 filing (negotiated rate)

Today Christine Stokes will be circulating the discount letter for the USGT 
deal to the usual TW personnel for approval.  Since the revenue sharing 
mechanism agreed to by the parties creates a negotiated rate, we will need to 
make the appropriate filing before the April 1 effective date.  

Attached are 3 documents:  1) cover letter (nearly identical to NNG's), 2) 
tariff sheets and 3) a copy of the discount letter for your reference.  (Glen 
and Mary, please put my draft of the tariff sheets into the usual tariff 
sheet format.  I hope the columns line up on my draft  -- if it is confusing, 
let me know and I will fax you a copy.)

Please let me know your comments as soon as possible...preferably by close of 
business Tuesday.  Thank you.

Great idea--I don't have any specific suggestions to add to this checklist, 
but I encourage all of you to help Susan get this finalized.  I know you guys 
have all worked hard on these deals and I appreciate that hard work and your 
patience.  We all deserve a system that works more smoothly, so lets take 
Susan's lead and create one!  Thanks.  DF

Subject: negotiated rates on TW

My experience with the February deals this week has shown me that we need to 
improve our system of communication on negotiated rate deals.  
I think a simple checklist for the marketers, legal & reg. would help.  
Here's what I suggest:

- Marketer:  Work with Susan on negotiated rate contract language.  E-mail 
draft of contract to Glen, Mary, Susan, Mary Kay and Drew for information and 
for sign-off by Legal and Regulatory prior to sending to the shipper.  

- Mary and Susan -- have a telephone conversation to confirm that a filing 
needs to be made, and if so when.  If a filing does not need to be made 
immediately, note filing date on both Mary's and Susan's calendars (and on 
Filing Log).

- Marketer:  Contract must be executed at least one day before gas flow.  
Once contract is executed, immediately (1) fax it to Mary at 402-398-7006 and 
(2) make sure the contract representative (Linda Trevino?) knows that it is a 
negotiated rate deal and needs to be posted on the transactional report.

- Mary?  Susan?:  Contact Linda Trevino to let her know the negotiated rate 
tariff page that should be reference on the transactional report.

-  Mary/Glen:  Draft negotiated rate filing and have Susan or Maria review.  
Rate language in tariff should be identical to contract negotiated rate 
language.  Send to D.C. for filing.

Let me know if I've left anything out, and I'll get this edited, spiffed up, 
etc. and circulate it to the marketers so we can get through April and all 
other future deals without a hitch.

One additional point.  If we aren't going to try to rebut the "funny money" 
argument on the merits, can we at least have Leslie Lawner or someone loaded 
up to dispute their circumstantial case?  Both Amoco and Dynegy argue that 
marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their 
sister pipelines than they do on non-affiliated pipes.  They argue that 
unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone.  The Enron pipes 
may be a statistical oddity on this.  A very small percentage of NN and TW 
capacity has been held by affiliates.  I think the same is true on Border and 
to a lesser extent on Florida.  Amoco and Dynegy can't have it both ways.  If 
they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe's capacity being 
held by marketing affiliates (i.e., El Paso) then they also have to infer an 
absence of abuse from a small percentage (i.e., the Enron pipes).  Can we 
argue this???  DF

I think Joan will do great at addressing the issue that there is no evidence 
of abuse.  I'm not as confident  that she will be as indignent as I would be 
about why we spent so much money on transactional reporting if nobody is 
going to use it.    I'm going to write up a q/a for her on this points.  We 
probably should make transparency a focal point in our follow-up comments.

him to tie the terminated contracts to the wells that were under those 
contracts (Conoco is now saying, "Well, how were they supposed to know what 
wells were tied to what contracts" - duh) and possibly when Conoco took over

Great--looks like a good start at working through this project.  I've got a 
couple of thoughts, questions, etc. that I'd like to discuss with you all 
before we get back to Tino with any kind of preliminary response:

1.  What is our pulse on a project that ramps up slowly to full utilization?  
This deal will not be 100% subscribed for several years (optimistically) as 
it is designed to gain market share from a combination of market growth and 
bypass of existing GCNM customers (and new power generation load, but that 
part of Tino's story needs more thinking).  The rates on the attached 
spreadsheet would provide full cost recovery only after the project is fully 
subscribed, right?  We need to think about the economics of this thing in 
terms of deferring and recovering in the out years the revenue shortfalls in 
the early years.  Has GPG ever done deals like that?  

2.  On the GCNM discounting issue, it seems we need at least three data 
points to understand our risks:
   a.  What do GCNM's current discounts look like? 
 b.  How much more aggressively could GCNM discount in the future if they had 
to to avoid bypass?   (i.e., are there regulatory or political constraints on 
increased discounts?)
 c.   Will the big industrial loads stick with the low cost provider if GCNM 
tries to undercut the project, or will they be willing to pay a little more 
just to assure that a new pipeline gets built into their backyard?    

3.  Assuming we don't have the risk appetite to get in on a project like 
this, how do we positiion ourselves to be the preferred upstream pipeline for 
Langley's project?  I assume that if neither TW nor El Paso partner with 
Langley he'll interconnect with both.  Do we already have or can we create 
any kind of competitive advantage under that scenario? 

4.  Is the right of way that Langley has negotiated really all that 
valuable?  From Lorraine's memo, it seems that the issue of which route is 
best is half baked at best.  If that's all Dennis brings to the table (not 
counting his big bag of $$$$), does a deal with him really make sense?   

I'm sure there are a lot of other issues we need to discuss, but these are 
the first that come to mind.  Please give me a call when you get together to 
discuss this as I'd like to be involved in how we respond to Tino and 
Dennis.  Thanks. DF

Subject: Albuquerque Project Bullets

1. The initial study of the Albuquerque project brought to Transwestern by 
Dennis Langley has been completed.

2.  Facility Planning provided Level A (+/- 30%) cost estimates for 3 
separate routes.  (Two of which were brought to us by Langley, the third; 
Facility Planning identified as being a shorter, cheaper route.)

3. Economic Analysis was run on the three options.  The attached spreadsheet 
details project rates and costs.

4. Current PNM tariff transmission rates indicate higher rates than potential 
Albuquerque project rates.  We know that PNM discounts (deeply when necessary 
to keep a customer from leaving its system), but we don't know 
definitively.   We continue to research current discounted rates.

5. The initial take on the feasibility of this project is good enough to 
forge ahead.

Please call me if you have any questions and as to our plan to respond to 
Tino.  Thanks.

FYI.  Attached is a copy of the Project Why status presentation that will be 
made next week at Stan's May 9 staff meeting.  The purpose of the 
presentation was to present a list of brainstorming ideas from an Apr. 16 
offsite session to GPG management & get some preliminary feedback on the 
kinds of ideas they would like to see proceed.  It was never meant to be a 
definitive plan for implementing those ideas.  I always envisioned the 
individual commercial groups picking up on which ideas they liked and wanted 
to implement & developing their own detailed plans for implementing.

I had an interesting conversation with Mark Courtney today, this time about 
something that doesn't cost us money.  He has gained a good bit of experience 
on transmission availability in NW New Mexico from the Gallup electric 
contract negotiation.  His take on transmission constraints is consistent 
with what Kevin and I had suspected:  Alb. is a load pocket and the 
prevailing flow is west to east into Alb.  Constraints only affect west to 
east flows and a generator in Alb. could always move power to four corners by 
displacement.  Courtney has worked with an ENA transmission guy named Steve 
Walton who apparently has more experience with the 230Kv transmission lines 
that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in Alb.  If we are not 
talking to him already, he would be another guy worth talking to.

This may be a good idea, but lets not forget that BP is the entity formerly 
known as "BP Amoco" which, if I'm not mistaken, is the home of Jeff 
Hooligan.  That guy sees evil in every pipeline deal,a nd may not have even 
known that his commercial people were doing deals with TW.  I'd like to think 
that the commercial people at BP have more clout than Hooligan and Kathy 
Edwards, but I wouldn't bet the ranch on that.  df

I'm assuming that BP Energy which is part of Indicated Shippers' Protest is

they can get Kathie to withdraw the protest?  Let's discuss if you think we

Subject: ETS risk management policy revisions

I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
Policy. 

Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.

I had a meeting with El Paso the afternoon of Nov. 6th to discuss the 
abandonment, and the "next steps"

El Paso agrees to shoot for a November 30, 2000 close, with them assuming 
commercial and revenue responsibility on December 1st.  I requested funds 
transfer to NNG on the first business day of Jan 2001.

All exhibits to the P&SA are collected and being made available to legal for 
incorporation into closing documents.  These include MMS ROW's, space lease 
agreements on  three platforms, and a surviving NNG/Sea Gull transport 
agreement.

Robert Newman with EGC has contacted El Paso field operations and they have 
developed a list of information operations will transfer to El Paso regarding 
pipeline Ass Builts, maintenance information,. metering activity, MMS safety 
inspections, corrosion control, leak histories, etc.

Preliminary worksheet showing the "Adjusted Price" was developed and agreed 
to with El Paso.  Estimate of proceeds at the time of closing will be 
$1,357,107.00.  This was developed using estimates for the last three months 
revenue stream, and four month of O&M.  The final number will be developed 
and routed internally once actual variable are known.  Due to the transition 
to SAP, queries be expense code are more difficult to obtain.

If you should have any questions or need any information please let me know.

Thanks, Bob

Thanks for the extremely helpful analysis Steve and John.  I'm getting a 
pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently 
configured.  Just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of 
observations for the group to react to, along the lines of Steve's "However" 
section of his memo:

1.  Running this thing as a baseload unit won't work.  The fuel cost is a 
killer.  However, I keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 Corners spot price 
someone mentioned on the phone.   Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to 
support a peaking merchant plant?  How often are those types of opportunities 
available, and could a power plant in Alb. capture that upside by 
transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system?  
  
2.  We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant.  
Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE/DOD 
electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor.  I think we have all 
assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell 
surplus power into the grid (either at 4 Corners or, after N.M. elec. 
restructuring, into the Alb. area).   I just found the numbers I was 
remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual 
1998 consumption was 334.5 million Kwh.  By my lawyer-math, that is about a 
60% load factor for DOE.  If the DOE load is only 60% L.F., and the plant 
only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that 
arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds 
some benchmark rate ($.05/Kwh?  $.10/Kwh?  higher?)  the plant might run at a 
30-40% load factor on an annual basis.  The question is can we reduce the 
capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit?

3.  Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand 
charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., DOE) but sold the rest of its output 
into the grid only when profit opportunities arose?      

4.  If the answer to 3. is no, would ENA backstop the debt financing by 
signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what 
the government needs?   At what price?  Based on its knowledge of volatility 
and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners, and future profit 
opportunities that will be available in Albuq. is that just a dumb bet, or 
would ENA get interested if someone else (i.e., DOE) split the risk and 
reward?  

John, how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a 
way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley?  If we pull the plug on the 
project, I'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our 
information on why the turbines we would use can't provide acceptable 
economics.  I don't expect that we'd want to disclose the swap value analysis 
in Steve's memo, however.  

Thanks again, and I'd appreciate anyone's reaction to the above questions.  
DF

Subject: Re: Pueblo  

John's proposed plant costs are consistent with what we have seen for our 
ongoing LM6000 development.   I have priced 130 MW at Four Corners  assuming 
Permian gas plus 50 cents for transport.  This also assumes $4.70 per MWh for 
O&M and an 8000 heat rate.

For an hourly 7x24 product, the intrinsic value of the gas-power swap is 
$52.5 million on a 20 year deal, well below the $108 million estimate of 
constructing the facility.  A ten year swap is worth only $42 million (NPV = 
-66 m ).  That implies a market mid-price of $34 per MWh levelized over the 
period.  

Using the ENA Power and Gas structuring model and curves, we can determine 
the following:
1.  New build gas turbines cannot compete against the New Mexico market on 
price.  
2.  LM6000 CCGT efficiency gain does not pay for HRSG and ST over a ten year 
period.

However:
1.  Transmission constraints could create market value in Albuquerque that 
does not exist at Four Corners.
2.  ENA's power prices typically undersell the market.
3.  Commodity pricing does not accurately value capacity or reliability in 
constrained markets.

If Enron wants to do a deal in Albuquerque, we should be selling capacity and 
reliability.  Given the number of power- critical industries in the area, we 
could look at siting several remote units at different locations in the 
city.  Numerous chip manufacturing facilities and the Kirtland base could 
support several LM6000's for power reliability that is specific to their 
installations.  

I might also suggest that peaking units would have advantages over CCGT 
units.  Existing generation already provides ample baseload supply, however, 
the production of peak and intermediate energy is not necessarily well suited 
to existing units.  LM6000's have exceptionally good ramp rates that provide 
real value to a utility customer.  Not only can the HRSG/ST hinder the 
flexibility of the units, it can add substantial capital and operating 
expense with little real market benefit.  

We should also explore the ability to schedule load.  If the DOE wants to 
peak for a test, would it be willing or able to schedule a test for the 
off-peak hours?  Under those circumstances, we might be able to cut them a 
break on power and provide reliability of supply.

Subject: Pueblo

Bill,

Yesterday, we decided to look at two options for Pueblo; a 60 MW case and a 
140 MW case.  In order to match these outputs as closely as possible with 
available equipment, I made the following selections:

Case 1
Equipment     3 X GE LM 2500 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 22 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   67 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  73.4 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  8170 Btu/kWh (HHV)

  
Case 2
Equipment     3 X GE LM 6000 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 44 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   130 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  143.7 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  7900 Btu/kWh (HHV)

There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized 
the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F 
for estimating power sales.  I have attached files that show the build-up of 
the estimated EPC price for the plants. 

The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file 
attached.  The projections are based on:

70% debt financing at 10% rate.
10-year project and debt life.
8500 hours per year at average output (97% capacity factor).
Gas at $4.40/MMBtu.

The results turn out pretty much as anticipated.  Even with the larger plant, 
we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.

wouldn't be a problem. 
When:? Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29. 
Where:? Kenebec S.D.? (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from 
Omaha) 
$$:?????? $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.?? If we dwindle 
to less than 8, its $100 per guy.? (he will cut us some slack on this if 
some of you can only hunt 2 days.) 
Fish:? Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included 
Lodging :? Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is 
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.? Super 8 is a 
lovely place:? motto is "Labs sleep free."? $100 per night, 4 guys per 
room+ $25/head/night. 

So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have 
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.?? I'd like to get 10 locked 
in solid by end of Sept.? More than that would make the hunting a little 
clumsy.? Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due 
around this time.? What a lame excuse!!? You were there for the first 4, 
right?? Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?? If you guys have anyone 
else that's interested other than the folks that have already been invited, 
let me know as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have 
around 10.? Talk to you.? DF

Subject: ECS Gallup contract

Here are some bullet points based on our conversation Friday morning 
regarding the ECS Compression Service Agreement.  These bullet points 
summarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a 
conversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined) 
regarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of 
the lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have 
additional comments, please let me know.  

We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that 
up to you, but do let me know if I can help. 

-  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a 
monitoring system that would automatically 
alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  

-  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission 
for TW to access the "Members Only" portion of CDEC's website (which contains 
load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a 
confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.

-  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on 
the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   "Good faith" 
by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any 
difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted 
in this regard.  

-  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load 
times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers 
with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this, 
but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have 
access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.

-  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July 
could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it 
did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information 
from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should 
therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.

-  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring 
system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the 
website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.

I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of 
the website; I'll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted 
"on a case-by-case basis."  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you 
know what I'm able to learn from them.

Here is a very rough draft -- an outline, really -- of an answer to Indicated 
Shippers' protest.

Please provide comments as you see fit.  I will probably not have time to 
look at them until later in the afternoon tomorrow, at which time I will also 
do a lot more writing (i.e., making complete sentences, transitions, heading, 
conclusion, etc.).  In other words, of greatest interest to me right now are 
your ideas on the best way to rebut the Shippers' arguments (including 
identifying those that might be safe to ignore). 

Thank you!

Drew;
Thanks for sending me off to read the order in CP99-522, etc.? I've  gotten a 
good feel for the relevant TW issues. 
Based on our preliminary information, TW looks attractive as the supply  
source for the Wikieup project.? 
?
FYI: I've discussed the project a couple of times with Jeff Fawcett, and he  
promised a first cut estimate? of facilities costs on this (as well as  
another) project, and suggested that it would be done by early March. 
Currently,  however, he seems to be among the missing (not returning phone 
calls,  etc.)? Maybe you could call over there and help me get his 
attention??  I'd sure like to make some progress on this deal.
?
Thanks for your help.
Regards,
GB

As you requested, following are the facts for the media regarding the 
negotiated rate deals that TW has recently done at rates in excess of the 
tariff max rate.   Please note that the first two transactions are already 
public and the following information can be disclosed now.  The third deal 
has not been filed yet and will not be public until it is.  That filing will 
be made before Dec. 1, 2000. 

General:  TW has done three deals in the last week at rates in excess of TW's 
maximum tariff rate.  Each of the deals was done pursuant to TW's negotiated 
rate authority, which FERC granted TW in 1997.  (Order issued April 11, 1997, 
Transwestern Pipeline Co., 79 FERC Par. 61,021).  Pursuant to that authority, 
TW has filed negotiated rate tariff sheets with the FERC, which are docketed 
at Docket No. RP97-288.  Details on the specific transactions are as follows:
  
Deal 1:  Counterparty:  PG&E Energy Trading
 Rate Schedule:  ITS-1
 Volume:    30,000/day
 Rate:  $.90/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges
 Term: the one day period of November 15, 2000
 Receipt points:  NNG Halley, West Texas Pool
 Delivery point:  SoCal Topock

Deal 2:  Same as Deal 1,  except term is one day period of November 16, 2000 
and rate is $.75/MMBtu  

Deal 3:  Counterparty:  Sempra Energy Trading
 Rate Schedule:  LFT
 Volume:  10,000/day
 Rate:  $1.00/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges
 Term:  Dec. 1-Dec. 31, 2000
 Receipt point:  Bloomfield
 Delivery point:  PG&E Topock

All of the above information is contained in TW's FERC filings on these 
transactions.  No other information is available as TW does not comment on 
specific customer transactions.

Subject: Participation & Dissent (P&D) Facilitator Training

As Enron continues to tackle communication issues and address employee 
feedback, we are in the process of implementing a decision-making/problem 
solving tool throughout the organization.  This tool is called Participation 
& Dissent (P&D).  This process is aimed at:

- Bringing the right people together
- Speeding up decisions
- Acting on the suggestions of employees 
- Fostering channels of communication so that employees can speak their minds 
openly 
AND 
- Delivering business results at the same time!  

To ensure that P&D sessions remain productive and timely, each session is led 
by a facilitator.  Throughout the Enron organization, heads of business units 
have identified top rated, high performing individuals to serve as 
facilitators for all of Enron.  

For ETS, the following individuals have been identified for this 
developmental opportunity:

John Dushinske
Don Hawkins
John Keller
Sue Neville
David Odneal
Colleen Raker
Bob Hill
Shelley Corman
Mary Kay Miller
Drew Fossum
Wilson Barbee
Janet Place

To ensure that the facilitators are comfortable with the P&D process, they 
will be asked to participate in a training session in early November.  
Two dates have been established for facilitator training:

Thursday - November 2,  2000 - At the Woodlands - 8:00 am to 5:30pm
or
Monday   - November 13, 2000 - At the Woodlands - 8:00 am to 5:30pm

You can select either of these dates to fit your schedule. This assumes we 
will be able to get a reasonable sized group for each of the two days.  The 
training will be one day long.  Cheryl Austin Brown and Howard Morgan of 
Keilty, Goldsmith & Company (the people who conduct the Executive Impact & 
Influence Program) will be conducting the program. 

Please have someone from your office contact my administrative assistant,  
Debbie Nowak either by email or telephone (713)853-3304 and let her know your 
availability for these dates.

Please feel free to contact me directly at Ext. 33972 and I will be happy to 
brief you on the status of the effort.

Currently I have 2 machines (one on 41, one on 47) plus a laptop.
Jean McFarland contacted me a couple of months ago with this idea.  Basically 
we would be replacing 3 computers with one laptop.  I will probably want to 
get a regular sized monitor for my work station on 41 (I do not know if this 
is included in the "docking station" entry).
If you like, I can get Jean to do the math on how much we would be saving, if 
anything.  My machine on 47 is really out of date.  Someone else can use my 
brand new computer on 41 though.

I think we both ought to (and the shippers as well if someone can talk them 
into filing).  We aren't a shipper but we do get happy customers and maybe 
even more throughput from the deal, so we clearly have a legitimate interest 
in expedited treatment.   DF

As you know, we are still waiting for FERC to issue the necessary certificate 
authority for the Southwest Gas/TW interconnect.  Ideally, the interconnect 
facilities would be approved so that they could be constructed by the Gallup 
in-service date.  Two of our Gallup shippers, Sempra and Reliant, have 
provisions in their Gallup contracts giving them the option to change their 
primary delivery point to the proposed Southwest Gas interconnect.  The TW 
commercial group approached me about a motion to expedite based on this 
contractual right.  (Keith, I know we've spoken about this before with 
Lorraine).  Lorraine called her business contact at Reliant, and Reliant's 
regulatory counsel in D.C. called me today to get more information.  He 
sounded very positive about filing a motion to expedite a decision in this 
proceeding and I sent him the relevant background information to get him 
started.  Getting Sempra to consider filing a similar motion might be more 
difficult, but Jeff Fawcett is going to work on his business contact there.   

I am going to put together and circulate a motion or letter to FERC from TW, 
stating that TW's ability to provide service to its shippers will be affected 
unless certificate authority is granted soon.  Any comments in the meantime 
-- let me know.

Subject: Electric Developments

When we originally decided to use my staff meetings for "graduate education" 
one of the hot topics was the electric industry.  We all had a first lesson 
on this topic in Shelley's electricity seminar last summer.  Now, John and 
Kevin have graciously agreed to join us Tuesday at 1:30 to discuss recent 
developments in electric markets and NN's and TW's efforts to attract power 
generation load to the system.  Specific topics I hope to cover include the 
following:
1.  What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer 
puts his plant?  
2.  Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over? 
3.  How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.  
separately)?
4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care? 
5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?
 Depending on how deeply we get into these topics, we may need to schedule a 
follow-up session at a later date.  I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.

Enron Offers to Buy Out Azurix
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Enron Corp. announced that it has offered up to $275 million in funding
to take Azurix Corp. (NYSE: AZX) private at a buy-out price of $7 per share=
.
Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 percent of Azurix, a global
water company that owns, operates and manages water and wastewater assets
and provides related services. The specific structure and timing of Enron's
proposal has yet to be determined, but the company's board is now consideri=
ng
the proposal.

ANALYSIS: Azurix has been plagued with operational and financial problems
over the last 12 months, culminating in the departure of its former CEO
Rebecca Mark in late August. Enron had established Azurix in July 1998
with a $2.4 billion acquisition of Britain's Wessex Water, which provides
water and wastewater services to a U.K. population of approximately 3.5
million. Operating primarily in the United Kingdom and Latin America=20
(Argentina
and Brazil), Azurix was intended to be Enron's vehicle to capitalize on
what it perceived to be favorable market conditions for water investments.


Yet, Azurix has not been a profitable operation for Enron, and has been
seen as a real anomaly when compared against Enron's consistent success
in its other ventures (for example, EnronOnline). For instance, Azurix
reported year-end 1999 net income of $67 million, significantly under=20
projections
for what Enron had hoped for the subsidiary. After months of speculation,
Mark stepped down both as Azurix CEO and from the Enron board of directors,
and was replaced by John Garrison, Jr. Mark maintained throughout her tenur=
e
as CEO of Azurix that the company needed time to develop core assets and
capabilities. However, this approach was in stark contrast to Enron's guidi=
ng
philosophy=01*as espoused by COO Jeffrey Skilling=01*which has moved the co=
mpany
away from owning hard assets. Skilling also believed that, although acquiri=
ng
the Wessex operation gave Azurix the engineering capability and industry
knowledge to participate in the water business, privatization of the water
industry has slowed down considerably since the company began to penetrate
this market. Instead of pursuing a capital-intensive strategy for Azurix,
Skilling wanted Azurix to become more of a service-oriented business. This
change in business direction coincided with the departure of Mark.

Yet, Azurix has continued to flounder even since Mark left. In the third
quarter of this year, Enron reportedly lost $128 million in its "corporate
and other" category and attributed a fourth of the loss to the Azurix=20
operation.
Azurix's stock price started a marked decline in early August when it was
announced that annual results would not meet analysts' expectations. While
Azurix was taken public in June 1999 at a price of $19 per share, it curren=
tly
is priced at $6 1/4 (at close of the markets on Oct. 30). This is an=20
approximately
$3 increase from what Azurix had been trading at recently, presumably due
to Enron's announcement of the proposed buyout.

Enron's buyout offer comes after four unnamed parties approached Enron
about buying its stake in Azurix. Reportedly, three out of the four potenti=
al
buyers were unwilling to pay more than $4 per share, although one of the
buyers initially considered an offer of $7 per share, but ultimately decide=
d
against the purchase. Enron's motivation in returning Azurix to a private
status is probably one of protecting its shareholders. Enron pointed out
in its announcement that shareholders would receive, on a timely basis,
a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price of
the shares at which Azurix has traded over the last several months.

Making matters worse for Enron, a group of plaintiffs, represented by New
York law firm Wechsler Harwood Halebian & Feffer LLP, have initiated a
class-action lawsuit against Azurix in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages
on behalf of all investors who purchased Azurix stock during the period
of June 9, 1999 (the date of Azurix's IPO) and Aug. 8, 2000, and who "suffe=
red
damages as a result." The law firm is claiming that Azurix violated the
Federal securities laws. I placed a call to the law firm this morning in
hopes of getting additional information about what the class-action suit
entails. Unfortunately, I did not receive a call back before press time.


The consensus among the vast majority of U.S. energy companies is that
the profitability of water as a convergence strategy is questionable. The
most obvious negative about the water business is that it most likely will
remain a heavily regulated delivery business, offering few opportunities
for private companies to penetrate the market. Water is a very staid busine=
ss
that seems inconsistent with Enron's aggressive growth strategy. After
Enron secures a fair return for Azurix's shareholders, it is not clear
what the company will do with its water subsidiary, but I would not be
surprised if Azurix is sold to another company. However, in August=01*right
before Mark's departure=01*Azurix announced that it had begun a pilot progr=
am
in the Lower Rio Grande using its Internet exchange Water2Water.com. The
site will provide users with information, price transparency and efficiency
in water exchanges. This announcement indicated that Azurix would begin
trading water rights, adding this commodity to the growing list of Enron's
traded commodities (energy, telecom, weather derivatives, etc.). So it
may be the case that Enron keeps Azurix, but turns it into a water trading
operation as opposed to water and wastewater services. In any case, the
present objective for Enron will be financing the buyout and ensuring that
Azurix's shareholders receive a significant premium to the market price
of Azurix. Enron also wants to ensure other benefits to Azurix, including
a significant near-term reduction in Azurix's general and administrative
expenses, greater certainty to Azurix's customers and employees and increas=
ed
flexibility for restructuring Azurix's assets and business.

Subject: Weekly Report for Feb 20

1. MOPS.  Suggested that the MOPS rehearing be brought to Madden's 
attention.  As a result we are looking at filing a motion to expedite.  Spent 
much of the week reviewing the MOPS proceeding up to date, reading pleadings 
and cases. Drafted a motion to expedite which has been circulated for 
comment.  While it is not very compelling for expedition, it is a way to get 
the proceeding brought to FERC's attention.  Apparently, there is a push to 
clean up old dockets.  Also it brought to my attention that Northern, in this 
proceeding, proposed to sell to Enron Gulf Coast Gathering, which I had 
forgotten.  so that if we find another purchaser, the filing will have to be 
amended. Also the Enron affiliate made the filing for the declaratory order.  
Kim Wilkie and  were talking about MOPS and what needs to be done while she 
is out on maternity leave.  We were talking about the waiver and ROFR 
agreements which John Goodpasture is getting executed.  We need to review 
whatever was done, if anything, at the time of the original filing to sell to 
the affiliate. Also take a look at the current ones to see if they would be 
broad enough to cover  not only Northern but a subsequent sale by Northern 
afilliate, if we should want to handle the sale of MOPS in that manner.
  2.  Attended the South End Task Force Meeting Tuesday morning.  It was a 
long meeting and quite productive. It was a brain dump by the south end 
commercial guys for Shelley and Mike and a man named Mike Gadd who called in 
from London who will work with Danny McCarty on asset deals.  It was decided 
to go ahead and start presenting potential deals to various Companies who we 
think would be interested in the various south end assets.  For exampleBob 
burleson is going to present a deal for some Permian assets to SPS.  SPS will 
have to divest certain power plants but still would like to maintain some 
control.   SPS may be interested in purchasing the pipelines form Northern 
and TW that currently serve the plants.  SPS would operate the line as an 
intrastate Hinshaw.  We think these asets are a good candidate to get Stans 
approval since they are not useful to get gas to California and the COS is 
$18 and incremental revenue is $2-3.  I will be involved in putting the 
proposal together starting with confidentiality agreements.  
Shelley believes that we should actively package and seek out potential 
interested buyers.  For example, approach Duke about the Hugoton area because 
Duke has a huge helium plant there. Also talk to El Paso because of its 
recent acqusition of CIG and ANR   and  interest in getting Rocky Moutain gas 
to Cailf.  Also seek out those interested in the Beaver assets and go make a 
pitch.
I am reading the existing contracts we have with Oneok as well as GPM/Duke to 
determine any adverse terms and conditions which could hinder a sale.
Another meeting is scheduled for the week of March 4 to go over the SPS deal 
with Stan.
 3 FERC Audit CWIP.  Continue working with Gary Zahn and Michelle Winckowski 
on a futher FERC inquiry on the Sublette work order.  Will prepare a response 
next week.


Next week continue work on the above items.

Subject: Introduction

One of Steve Kean's newly formed Working Groups is for "Rates & Tariffs".  I 
have been asked to lead this group.  For those of you who don't know me, I am 
in Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Affairs group, in a section called 
"Rates/Regulatory Services."  Our working group will have about a dozen or so 
people from various parts of Public Affairs.  You have been 
selected/volunteered to participate in this effort by your group leaders.  

The Working Group members are:
Ray Alvarez
Sergio Assad
Roy Boston
Mike Grimes
Kyran Hanks
Rita Hartfield
Nancy Hetrick
Tom Hoatson
Paul Kaufman
Valeria Lima
Bob Neustaedter

Having this group will give us a great opportunity to identify needs related 
to rate and tariff issues across many business lines and countries, share 
resources, problems and solutions, and generally improve the cohesiveness of 
Steve's organization   One of our first tasks will be to think through and 
concretely specify what we expect to accomplish as a group.   We do not have 
a specific product mandate per se - it will be up to us to figure it out and 
deliver it.   Some possibilities are - identifying rates and tariffs policy 
positions, developing policies where none now exist, but are needed, 
identifying rates and tariff resources available to the group, and acquiring 
resources needed by the group. 

As a preliminary matter, could you e-mail me your group name, position, 
location, phone, e-mail address, and "area of expertise".  We will assemble 
this information in a roster to be distributed to the group.

Early in January, we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an 
initial meeting.  Please be as flexible as possible.  In some cases, we are 
many time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired 
time. 

As a second preliminary matter, please give some thought to and e-mail me 
what you think a group like this should accomplish.  Remember, the roster 
above has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tariffs!   We 
will compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and 
distribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeting.   At that 
first meeting, we will talk through expectations of us and of each other, and 
the proposed goals.  
Please have your inputs to me by January 7.  I look forward to working with 
you.

Powergen and LG&E Complete Merger
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Powergen of the United Kingdom and LG&E Energy Corp. of Louisville, Ky.,
have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations. LG&E
will maintain its headquarters in Louisville, which will serve as the=20
headquarters
for Powergen's North American operations. LG&E Energy's utility subsidiarie=
s,
Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company, will continue
as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with=20
headquarters
in Louisville and Lexington, Ky., respectively.

ANALYSIS: Although referred to as a "merger," Powergen actually has acquire=
d
LG&E, a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all
three core sectors of the electric utility business (generation, transmissi=
on
and distribution). Powergen, which generates about 14 percent of the=20
electricity
used in England and Wales, is a company with clear intentions to expand
internationally. The company currently has electric and gas operations
in Europe, India, Asia and Australia. Together, the Powergen / LG&E=20
combination
reportedly will have assets of nearly $14 billion and total revenues of
$9 billion, serving four million customers worldwide.

The partnership marks the third acquisition of a U.S. electric utility
by a foreign company, following ScottishPower's purchase of PacifiCorp
and National Grid's purchase of the New England Electric System (NEES),
both in 1999. It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition
of a U.S. utility, the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have
become easier to pass.

Powergen's reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise
from needs similar to its U.K. counterparts. In the last ten years that
have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of=20
electricity
in the United Kingdom, the electric sector has become completely competitiv=
e
in all areas, including domestic customers. Just as in U.S. deregulation,
concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of U.K.
companies, which is compounded by the limited size of the U.K. energy marke=
t.
Consequently, companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both
in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through
opportunities abroad. Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the
U.S. market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan=
ies
in this country, including Cinergy and Houston Industries (now Reliant),
which all fizzled.

LG&E is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the U.K. company's
desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market. LG&E should
be a good partner for Powergen, as the latter gains access to approximately
3.7 million customers. In addition, LG&E owns equity in and operates=20
non-utility
power plants in six states as well as in Spain; owns interest in three
natural-gas distribution companies in Argentina; and owns CRC-Evans Pipelin=
e
International, a provider of specialty equipment to the natural-gas and
oil pipeline construction industry. Altogether, LG&E's two utilities and
numerous unregulated businesses total about $5 billion in assets, which
should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind.
Perhaps Powergen's primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan=
y
values LG&E's comparatively low-cost power production and high standards
regarding reliability and customer service.

Yesterday (Dec. 11) marked LG&E Energy's last day of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. Shareholders on record should receive letters of=20
transmittal
from Powergen's paying agent, Computershare Trust Company of New York,
containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the
agreed-upon cash payment of $24.85 per share. An additional payment of
25.276 per share will also be paid to LG&E Energy shareholders on record
as of Dec. 8.

Powergen reportedly paid about $3.2 billion for LG&E, and assumed an=20
additional
$2.2 billion in LG&E debt. During the merger process, there was a lot of
speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LG&E, despit=
e
its disclosure of divesting key assets=01*such as overseas interests, its
metering business and two U.K. power stations=01*to generate liquid capital=
.
During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition,
Standard & Poor's kept Powergen's debt position under scrutiny, although
its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any
significant downgrades in its ratings. Moving forward, it will be interesti=
ng
to see how the company's rating changes now that the acquisition has been
completed.

We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of U.S. utilities=
=01*
and
all are still fairly new=01*so consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu=
re
of two foreign corporate cultures will work. As an example of difficulties
that Powergen might face, ScottishPower encountered a multitude of=20
difficulties
assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of
PacifiCorp. In addition, although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have
claimed that they intend to become major players in the U.S. markets throug=
h
their acquisitions of U.S. companies, that has yet to materialize.

Where the combined company goes from here is unknown. It is possible that
Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed
that this will be a key area of expansion. Another possible strategy is
developing its telecom business. Powergen announced its move into the U.K.
telecommunications sector earlier this year. Powergen's joint venture with
Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc=
ts
and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with
multi-utility billing solutions. Thus, speculation has been raised that
the company may develop this area of its business in the United States
as well. It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa=
ny
attempts an acquisition of a U.S. utility. Consequently, many eyes will
remain on the Powergen / LGE combination as it should be a good indicator
of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be.

I'm having Martha schedule a conf. call to discuss this.  I also want to 
discuss potential exposure if PG&E's public disclosure strategy kicks off a 
round of lawsuits.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: PG&E Topock Volumes

 I spoke to Dan Thomas with PG&E this morning regarding the possibility of 
lifting the flow restriction at Topock. He indicated that they did briefly 
discuss the issue but in light of their current public relations efforts to 
inform the press and policy makers of the current situation they did not feel 
it would be appropriate to increase the limits at this time. However, he did 
indicate that they will be working on some additional "milestones" which will 
allow us to increase flows once they are met .

UL Approval for MTL 7000 Series Barriers


Many of you have inquired whether MTL barriers and isolators held UL
approval, and we are most pleased to report that Underwriters Laboratories
has granted UL 913 (Intrinsically Safe Applications) approval to all MTL
7000 Series Shunt Diode Barriers -- this adds to our FM and CSA approvals.

The 7000 series has been categorized by UL as "Process Control Equipment for
Use in Hazardous Locations." The barriers are suitable for use in Class
I/Division 2, Groups A/B/C/D hazardous locations with intrinsically-safe
connections to Class I/II/III, Groups A/B/C/D/E/F/G hazardous locations.

MTL barriers are used more often than those of any other manufacturer of
Intrinsically Safe Devices, and you may already be aware that Control
magazine has once again cited MTL for its Readers' Choice Award - this
continues the succession of recognition in 1997, 1998, and 1999.

The MTL 7000 Series Barriers offer exceptionally high packing density (.28
in.), about half the size of conventional barriers -- this nearly doubles
normal packing density, reduces weight, and delivers a significant savings
on cabinet space.

Another advantage is the integral disconnet facility for isolating safe and
hazardous area circuits. The line can be disconnected without disturbing the
wiring just by swinging out the replaceable fuse. This allows significant
potential cost savings by enabling the MTL 7000s to function as a field
terminal in many instances.

Finally, the MTL 7000 Series improves flexibility and reduces installed
cost, since the barriers are clamped and grounded simultaneously on a
standard DIN-rail.

To discover how you can benefit from an MTL solution in a variety of
applications, visit us at www.mtlnh.com, www.mtl-inst.com, and/or
www.telematic.com. You may call MTL at (800) 835-7075 for the location of
the MTL Representative nearest to you.

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved 
posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas 
Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink 
project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to 
markets in New Jersey and New York.

Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco 
to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 
Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state 
of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind 
and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire 
MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file 
executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four 
months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate 
eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered 
by the original certificate.

The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on 
non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project 
and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The 
$80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 
would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the 
Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a 
portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines 
currently are running full.

Tom Celentano of FERC Energy Markets (in Scott Miller's group) is collecting 
informal information about the California market.  He has asked Transwestern 
to provide the following information for the gas day of December 7.  He would 
like this data in the next few hours (preferrably via fax 202-208-1010):

Capacity available by segment 
Whether TW had any curtailments, OFOs, or any other limitations or penalties 
in place
Scheduled capacity to the California delivery point by service type
Any nominations which were not confirmed/scheduled at the California delivery 
points
Throughput

Initially he also asked for pricing data -- specifically any information that 
we have about delivered prices at the California border.  Steve Harris and I 
told him that any information we would have on this point would probably be 
hearsay or info. from gas daily or EOL sources.    He said he had access to 
published data & we could drop this part of the request.

Steve January is working on providing items 1-5.

Based on the above, it seems that the decision to advise them we can't retier 
still stands.  Isn't there a way to give them the $30,000 of value in another 
manner which doesn't make us file for waiver? Alternatively, we have given up 
more than this in the past to resolve their errors, don't adjust?   We can 
still tell them we plan to address in our Order 637 filing-  MK

Sorry you weren't able to join my hunting boondoggle in SoDak!  It was epic.  
Lots of birds (the wild variety, not pen raised and tied down like at 
Pheasant Haven!)  We saw literally 1500-2000 birds over three days of 
hunting, and limited out every day.  Got my first double--two shots, two

Subject: P G & E Credit Assurance

 In order to comply with the request we have made to P G  & E of a 12:00  
P.M. CST deadline, Chris Chung of P G & E has advised that our proposal has 
to be submitted to him by Noon today in order to effect a  wire transfer by 
the Monday deadline. Drew is close in the completion of generating the 
Agreement, however, with the internal review and approval process, it is 
doubtful we can achieve the timetable needed by P G  & E. It would be my 
recommendation that we extend the deadline from Monday, January 29 at Noon to 
Tuesday, January 30 at Noon. This would permit our internal review with the 
expectation of sending P G & E our Agreement by Monday morning and allowing 
time for their review. I have spoken to Drew and he is comfortable with this 
approach. Additionally, in my conversation with Chung, I indicated that our 
approach and proposal would be for P G & E to wire transfer the necessary 
funds prior to our providing transportation for February and then payment 
would be expected to be made for the January transportation on the 
appropriate due date in February. (Approximately the tenth )

 Please advise your comments at your earliest conveniece.

 Thanks and Regards.

San Francisco Muni Attempt Poses Additional Challenge for PG&E
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Backers of a plan to create a publicly owned power system in San Francisco
and Brisbane, Calif., got a financial boost recently with a panel approving
$754,250 in taxpayer money to study public power and related issues. Most
of the money will be used to study how the proposed municipality district
would work and how it would be financed. The Board of Supervisors Finance
Committee approved the spending, but put $400,000 of the money on reserve,
pending the selection of contractors to perform the study and determine
the scope of the work.

ANALYSIS: This news item circulated about two weeks ago, but it still deser=
ves
attention as this could have tremendous impact on PG&E. The announcement
of the municipalization study comes at arguably the worst possible time
for PG&E as the utility already faces a multitude of financial and public
relations problems. Yet, in fact, the issue has been developing for several
months. Back in July, supporters of municipalization in PG&E's service
territory turned in a petition with 23,500 signatures calling for the creat=
ion
of a municipal utility district (meaning that electric service would be
provided by a city rather than an investor-owned utility).

First, let me provide some brief context regarding PG&E's current condition=
.
The utility is in debt of over $3 billion due to uncollected fees related
to the price spikes of last summer. PG&E's objective is to bill its custome=
rs
for this debt, and toward that end has petitioned to raise its rates with
the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).  Under PG&E's plan,
average residential monthly bills reportedly would increase from about
$54.50 to $63.50 on Jan. 1. Naturally, consumer activist groups such as
TURN that carefully monitor PG&E's every move have contested the rate=20
increase,
arguing that the utility alone is responsible for the debt it currently
faces. Since it is uncertain if the CPUC will grant PG&E's petition,=20
speculation
that the utility will become financially insolvent has begun to grow.

Both San Francisco and the smaller city of Brisbane to the south are includ=
ed
in the study because municipalization must include two separate cities
in order to take effect. If municipalization is ultimately approved, these
two cities would form a new district and elect directors who would then
attempt to purchase PG&E's power grid in the area.

Proponents of the muni bypass effort say that the cities can provide less
expensive power to customers than PG&E, as the utility must pay dividends
to stockholders and compensate well-paid executives. PG&E has already start=
ed
damage control in response to the study, arguing against the formation
of a municipal utilities district. First, the utility has said simply that
it is not for sale, but more importantly it is PG&E's contention that=20
customers
would not necessarily save money if the cities in question were to=20
municipalize
their electric districts. In addition, PG&E says the cost for the cities
to buy its assets=01*necessary power plants, utility lines and other=20
infrastructure=01*would
run about $1 billion, which in fact would make the project more expensive
in the long run for customers.

Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield is spearheading the municipalization
effort and is using the problems in San Diego as a means to support his
case. His name may sound familiar, as Rosenfield has been involved in many
seemingly anti-investor owned utility (IOU) measures in California. Back
in 1998, Rosenfield led the fight for Proposition 9, which would have=20
essentially
put a screeching halt on deregulation in the state. Although Prop. 9 was
ultimately defeated at the ballot, had it passed the measure would have
stopped the three California IOUs from charging customers for the costs
associated with $6 billion in bonds they had sold to pay for the 10-percent
rate cut that customers began receiving in January 1998. Prop. 9 would
have blocked the utilities from recouping any of their stranded costs,
which of course SDG&E has now accomplished and reportedly the other IOUs
(SCE and PG&E) are close to doing so as well. Rosenfield was a key particip=
ant
in Californians Against Utility Taxes (CUT), which lobbied repeatedly for
electric rates to be reduced by 20 percent for small consumers (as opposed
to the 10 percent that was included in the state's restructuring bill).

Along with this study related to specific cities, there reportedly is a
simultaneous movement from Governor Gray Davis for a state takeover of
the power transmission grid, power plants and government-sponsored=20
construction
of new generating plants. In early December, an internal memo was leaked
indicating that the governor was considering these measures as a response
to the tight supplies and high prices seen in San Diego last summer. Includ=
ed
in the plan would be a restructuring of the state's power system wherein
the grid of transmission lines and power plants would be placed under state
control. Among several points on which PG&E and the governor disagree,
Davis has proposed an extended rate freeze for customers of all of the
three state's IOUs. While PG&E is pushing for a rate increase, California's
highest official reportedly would implement an indefinite rate freeze that
would further complicate PG&E's plan to pull itself out of debt.

Municipalization attempts in cities across the United States have increased
over the last two decades. Just last week, the city of Hermiston, Ore.,
was granted the right to acquire, by condemnation, the distribution facilit=
ies
that Pacific Power uses to serve parts of the municipality. The Umatilla
County Circuit Court has upheld the city of Hermiston's right to acquire,
by condemnation, the distribution facilities Pacific Power uses to serve
parts of the municipality. The city has been trying to acquire those=20
facilities
since 1998, with the intent of forming its own utility to serve the 4,000
commercial and residential customers now served by Pacific Power. Of course=
,
even though this is a significant ruling, it will remain embroiled in court
for some time. A jury trial to set the dollar amount of compensation for
Pacific Power's facilities won't start until March 12, 2001. Other=20
well-publicized
municipalization attempts have taken place in Lakewood, N.Y. (failed) and
a number of cities across Florida.

However, despite the rise in muni bypass efforts, the fact remains that
no contested municipalization effort of any significant size has been=20
successful
since the one that occurred in Massena, N.Y. back in 1982. At that time,
the city of Massena offered low-cost hydropower and tax-free financing,
which made the municipalization attempt beneficial to citizens. Today,
cities rarely can offer such advantages, which had made it difficult for
muni bypass efforts to succeed. Statistics show that, when given the option
to develop a city-run electric system by dissolving the incumbent utility's
authority, citizens across the country have chosen to retain the IOU model.
Of course, arguments could be made that in such cases the IOU lobbying
force has been a formidable component, wielding the capital necessary to
wage a successful campaign to protect its business. Yet, at the same time,
a case can be made that the benefits of municipalization just have not
been proven and that explains why citizens generally have opted to retain
the IOU model.

There is both good and bad news for PG&E related to this particular study.
The bad news is that studies such as these most often recommend=20
municipalization,
which makes it very difficult for local politicians to resist a takeover.
In other words, because the wheels have started turning toward=20
municipalization
in the area, it is more than likely that PG&E will have to engage in a
battle to preserve its business. Even though past history shows the attempt
probably would not be successful if PG&E contests it, the bypass effort
would result in PG&E spending a lot of money and time to fight the effort.

The good news is that time is on the utility's side. Municipalization is
usually a long and involved process. The fact that the Finance Committee
gave the green light to proceed with the study is only the first in many
regulatory checkpoints. The next steps are the full board's consideration
of the funding request for the study, and subsequently a decision whether
or not to put municipalization on the local ballot. Then the hard campaigni=
ng
would begin to sway public opinion one way or the other. Thus, even if
muncipalization of the two cities were to occur, PG&E still has some time
to potentially resolve its debt situation and construct a strong opposition
to the muni attempt.

However, from a public relations standpoint, this is just the last thing
that PG&E needs at this point. The utility continues to spin media coverage
to convey that it is only trying to recoup a debt that it accrued on behalf
of its obligation to serve customers. Adversaries such as TURN and Harvey
Rosenfield, however, are just as aggressively working to convince the publi=
c
that PG&E is trying to unfairly stick customers with a $3 billion tab.
To now have discussions emerge about whether or not city government could
more effectively provide electric service is another fire that PG&E will
have to extinguish if it wants to remain operational.

Subject: Mastio Survey

Attached below are the Mastio Survey presentations for TW, NNG and NBPL which 
are to be reviewed with Stan and his direct reports on March 30. I want to 
thank everyone for their time and effort in reviewing the findings and 
recommendations for the Action Plans for each pipeline. The next steps will 
be to make sure we focus on addressing the areas stated in the Actions Plans. 

I also want to take the time to thank Tammy Lee-Jaquet for all her efforts in 
pulling this information together for TW & NNG. In addition, Kirsten Hand was 
instrumental in analyzing our information.  We could not have done this 
project without them. GREAT JOB!!

This is only the first phase of this project which means we now have the task 
to ensure we address the areas of the Action Plans. More to come!!

Thanks again everyone. Julia

The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe=

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20

they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=

employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20

Drew/Mark,

Further to conversation this morning with Drew, it appears that it would be=
=20
helpful to include the Request for Service (TFX) form in the GTC, as this i=
s=20
the form which FERC has approved for use when a customer requests pipeline=
=20
capacity.

This would mean inserted something like the following into the Long=20
Description: "Customer agrees that this transaction will be governed by the=
=20
terms contained within the online General Terms and Conditions (GTC)."

Which would make the final long description:


US Gas NNG Capacity     Perm1 to Perm 1       Nov00-Dec00    USD/MMBtu

A transaction with Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG) under which NNG will=
=20
transport, on a firm basis, a maximum daily volume (stated in MMBtu per day=
)=20
equal to the volume identified on the web site. Customer agrees that this=
=20
transaction will be governed by the terms contained within the online Gener=
al=20
Terms and Conditions (GTC).The Term of the Transaction shall be from the=20
Effective Date of 01 Nov 2000 to the Termination Date of 31 Dec 2000. This=
=20
transaction provides firm pipeline transportation capacity with the primary=
=20
receipt and delivery point of the Permian Pool (POI 54009).  The posted rat=

also applicable for all alternate receipt and delivery points in MIDS 1-7,=

with the exception of Argus Zone points and Field Area TBS=01,s.  In additi=
on,=20
the following charges apply: the maximum commodity charge; all applicable=

surcharges; and fuel use and unaccounted for.=20


The text contained within the GTC could then appear as follows:



Please let me know if you think this works and are happy with it.

I read Wednesday's NGPL order (RP00-18-002) as applying only to NGPL due to 
their unique restrictions and tariff rules.  I do not read it as forcing the 
rest of the industry (i.e., us) to use the floor rate as the reserve price 
for negotiated index rate bids and ordinary recourse rate bids.  I think we 
can still determine the reserve price on a prearranged deal like the ENA deal 
based on our good faith valuation of the upside provided by the index 
mechanism.  I.e., on that type of deal, we can determine that the index 
mechanism is worth "x cents" to us and require a discounted recourse rate 
bidder to bid more than the floor plus x cents to win.  Agreed?  

Note that NGPL whined that the unique rules they are subject to place them at 
a competitve disadvantage to the rest of the industry (i.e., us) on this 
issue.  The commission didn't say anything about that, implying to me that 
the rest of us are still free to do what NGPL cannot do.   DF

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of a policy to be distributed 
to EOL/ENA employees. While the policy may seem over-restrictive, the fact 
basis upon which the policy is based is that the activities identified in the 
policy are currently performed by ENA employees. Of course, we still need to

Subject: Pueblo

Here's a weird one.  Could we structure the Pueblo pipeline project with the 
following characteristics: 
1.  The lateral from TW's mainline to Albeq. is wholly TW owned (i.e., no 
joint venture with Langley);
2.  The lateral  is 100% debt financed (i.e., it is expected to cost about 
$20 million, which TW would borrow in a project financing, secured by the 
revenue stream under the firm contract for service on the new lateral);
3.  TW files for a 7(c) certificate, seeking an incremental rate for service 
on the new lateral;  Any service on the TW mainline will be subject to TW's 
existing rates;
4.  TW designs the max. incremental rate based on normal cap. structure, 
deprec., O&M, allocations, etc.
5.  TW has one contract for 40,000/day, for 10 years for service on the 
lateral;
6.   The rate for that one customer is a negotiated rate that is based on an 
alternative ratemaking study under which the customer pays enough $$ to cover 
debt service on the project financing, incremental deprec., O&M, A&G, etc.  
No allocated costs or any other costs related to TW's preexisting facilities 
are included in the negotiated rate.  
7.  TW is entirely at risk for cost recovery, but the one contract covers all 
actual costs, except return and taxes on the new line. Basically, the one 
contract locks in a floor of break even cash flow.  If TW fails to lock up 
any additional customers there will never be any "taxable income" for the 
line since debt servicing costs and other expenses completely eat up the 
revenue under the one big contract.  Therefore, there will never be any 
return or taxes related to the new line, unless TW locks up additional 
contracts.  
8.  Any additional contracts TW locks up will generate TW's upside for the 
project. 

The question is can we do this?  Will FERC let us build it?  Will FERC let us 
oversize the pipeline significantly larger than the 40,000/day that the one 
big firm customer needs?   I'm sure I've left out important facts, so I'll 
try to grab you tomorrow to discuss.  

The overall objective is to create the "leanest" possible initial cost 
structure for the pipeline, and therefore for the Langley power plant, 
consistent with TW being able to get the new pipeline built.  I.e., lets get 
the pipe built and help the power plant get to a cheap enough elec. rate that 
they can get their big contract with the govt.  and economically sell surplus 
off-peak power onto the grid.  Even if the new incremental rate for service 
on the lateral is a break even rate, TW's upside comes from incremental 
throughput from the Permian to the new lateral, at a rate of $___/MMBtu, and 
from any additional bypass load we can pick up from PNM (it looks like TW's 
rates off of the new line will beat PNM's industrial rates).   

I appreciate your input on this.  DF

Subject: Gallup One Time Payment

Please find attached an explanation of how the $2.8M was negotiated from Dave 
Foti and myself.  The other file attached is the calculations per the 
contracts we executed with ESC and the earnings impact, if we agree with ESC 
new one time payment.  

 The economic benefit  to be derived from this change may or may not be 
achieved, because it is dependent on ESC and TW ability to avoid the peak 
demand  charge.  ESC has an obligation in the contract to assist TW in 
developing a system to monitor and avoid the peak demand charge.  If ESC 
receives this benefit in  the one time payment, TW may lose any leverage we 
have.  The demand payment includes full payment of these peak demand charges 
with ESC rebating the 
 cost on a monthly basis, if these charges are avoided.

 If we need to develop our negotiating strategy before we meet with ESC on 
Wednesday, please advise.

 
 Dave Foti & James Centilli

Your recollection is correct.  However, I got the disturbing sense that FERC 
would have pounded NGPL for setting the recouse rate a penny higher than the 
negotiated rate reserve price.  Lets talk MOn. on whether we are still OK on 
the ENA deal.  Thanks. DF

I think the major difference is that in NGPL"s as I recall, they set the 
recourse at max while the other negotiated rate was significantly lower.  We 
did not set the recourse at max--  MK

Subject: ENA Deal

I read Wednesday's NGPL order (RP00-18-002) as applying only to NGPL due to 
their unique restrictions and tariff rules.  I do not read it as forcing the 
rest of the industry (i.e., us) to use the floor rate as the reserve price 
for negotiated index rate bids and ordinary recourse rate bids.  I think we 
can still determine the reserve price on a prearranged deal like the ENA deal 
based on our good faith valuation of the upside provided by the index 
mechanism.  I.e., on that type of deal, we can determine that the index 
mechanism is worth "x cents" to us and require a discounted recourse rate 
bidder to bid more than the floor plus x cents to win.  Agreed?  

Note that NGPL whined that the unique rules they are subject to place them at 
a competitve disadvantage to the rest of the industry (i.e., us) on this 
issue.  The commission didn't say anything about that, implying to me that 
the rest of us are still free to do what NGPL cannot do.   DF

NGPL has filed an application requesting approval to sell its interest in 
certain offshore facilities to Green Canyon and is also requesting 
non-jurisdictional status of the subject facilities.  Northern owns an 
undivided interest in certain of the facilities being sold by NGPL.    The 
Commission has issued a data request to Northern regarding its interest in 
the subject offshore facilities.  I just became aware of this data request 
this morning.  

The FERC has requested that Northern provide the following:

"Northern is requested to present formally its views to the Commission on the 
jurisdictional status of its fractional ownership interest in these 
facilities.  These submissions should include specific information regarding 
the current classification of the facilities, for purposes of accounting and 
rate treatment. " 

Because Northern's response is due on Thursday, November 9th, I have taken 
the liberty of drafting a response for your review.  This response is similar 
to Northern's previous responses in other dockets.  Please  provide your 
comments by noon, Wednesday, November 8 as Northern must send its response to 
Washington in overnigth mail for filing on 
Thursday.  Thanks MW

I have sent you this e-mail to inform you that FERC data requests were
issued yesterday, 11-6-00, to  your company (see company name and the
individuals listed below) which require written responses by your company
within 3 days of the date of the data request or by Thursday, 11-9-00 in the
captioned dockets.  As you may recall, in those dockets (a copy of the
applications were originally sent you in which your company also had some
imput), NGPL requested authority to abandon, by sale to Green Canyon Pipe
Line Company, L.L.C. (Green Canyon) and East Breaks Gathering Company,
L.L.C. (East Breaks), certain currently operational and previously abandoned
and retired in place wholly and jointly owned laterals, meter, field
compressors and appurtenances located offshore Louisiana and Texas.  NGPL
also requested that FERC declare these facilities to be nonjurisdictional
upon abandonment and tranfer to Green Canyon and East Breaks.  The above
data requests require your company to submit its views on the jurisdictional
status of your fractional ownership interests in the facilities (of NGPL
also has an interest which NGPL is requesting to abandon in the above
dockets) and request that your submission include specific information
regarding the current classification of the facilities for purposes of
accounting and rate treatment.  I would call your attention Attachment 4 to
the applications in both dockets which show the facilities in question and
the related ownership interests that FERC is referring to.  For your
conveniance I have attached Excel spreadsheets of Attachment 4 to both of
the applications for your review.  The data requests themselves can be
downloaded on CIPS in the captioned dockets (I have attached below for your
convenience the data request sent to Koch as an example as the wording in
these requests is identical except for the company and the addressee --
these requests are in Wordperfect format).  Your attention to these data
requests is greatly appreciated.  Thanks for your help.

Subject: First Quarter Forecast

Please review the attached forecast package and send any questions or 
comments to me by 2:30 PM on Friday, March 10th in lieu of an officer review.

A few items to note:  The first quarter is up from our last forecast by 
$5.1MM primarily due to timing of O&M expenses and margins.  The total year 
is flat to Plan.  I have left the upside in the 1st quarter until we meet 
with Rod on Monday to assess where GPG or Corporate need us to be.  We can 
shift some of the upside to 2nd quarter if needed.  We have also collapsed 
the variance explanations to show the changes to date from Plan.

Base gas has been increased by a net of $10MM from Plan, made up of an 
increase in the gain of 11.4 in the 2nd qtr. less SBA fees of (1.2) in 3rd & 
4th qtrs. and legal fees of (.2) in O&M in 3rd qtr.

All of the updates included in the mini-current estimate have also been 
incorporated.  Margin and O&M detail sheets include only the first quarter.

When you open the excel file, you will be asked whether you want to update 
linked information.  Please choose NO.  Once the file is opened, click on 
"file," "print," and then click "entire workbook" and then "OK."  You should 
have a cover sheet with 9 pages behind it.  The graph is in a separate file 
and is only one page.

Please let me know if you have any trouble printing, and we can fax you a 
copy.

Thanks,  Elaine

 Just got an update on the project that won't go away.  Dennis has a meeting 
lined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.  He is going to pitch the 
project as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read 
"financed by") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\or third 
parties (read "Enron"?).  Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get 
a more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, 
even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas 
load.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics 
using about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis' 
argument is going to be:  "I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and 
the power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you."  
"You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, 
you will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or 
escalate, you lose."    Either way, your reliability improves and you kick 
PNM in the shins."  Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on 
this.  By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign, 
and won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even 
more publicity.  You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely 
to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or 
cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.  They think his real 
angle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor 
out there!!  Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got 
hosed and made a scapegoat unfairly.  
 I've asked  Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together 
to give to Tino to confirm whether his $2 price is wacky.  Other than that, I 
just told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the 
project if the risks and rewards make sense, and that EE&CC might be 
interested in the design/build on all of it.  He said he'd get back to me 
after the 25th meeting and tell me whether the project is undead.  DF

Bummer.  Thanks for the quick answer.  The Maritimes case does give us at 
least a small foothold to use.  DF

Subject: Re: Gallup request for rehearing  

My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on 
point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of 
contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:

**
 In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), 
Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it 
submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that 
Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. 
Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off 
dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such 
information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes 
requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept 
confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years 
public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for 
confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market 
support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the 
contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of 
longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and 
support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed 
services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of 
the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made 
public. 

FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could 
terminate contingent on the
occurrence of certain events.

FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996).
**

In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas 
Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a 
request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission 
explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment 
but transportation contracts should not:  

the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a 
different
footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are 
subject to similar disclosure
requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas 
sales in a
competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under 
the assumption that the pipeline
exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that 
competition is from other
pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting 
requirements. 

There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the 
context of Section 4 cases.  

Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the 
next few days and let you know if I find anything.

Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the 
Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm 
having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on 
Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised 
draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, 
are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted 
confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in 
expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to 
recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. 
treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF

Question:
Under the Standards of Conduct for Northern, Section III ("Merchant 
Function"), Paragraph 284.286(a), last sentence reads "The Pipeline Sales 
Division reports to the President of Northern."  We all know that this is now 
Dan McCarty.  However, whereas Bill Cordes' title was 'President', every 
announcement about Dan refers to him as 'Managing Director and Chief 
Commercial Officer for ETS'.  Does the word "president" exist anywhere in 
Dan's job description so as to make this sentence imply the presidency role 
rather than inferring it?

Drew,

Thanks for the procedures.  We need to add Theres Branney to the list of 
people that can trade.  She is now trading in the storage group in the same 
capacity as Morgan and myself.  We are all extremely confident of her 
knowledge and ability to do these trades.  Is there anyone I need to contact 
to get her name added to this trading authority?

Sue

Subject: Trading Authority

Per your request, Kent, I've talked to Rod and confirmed with him the 
procedures we need to be following on all trading activity until we complete 
final ETS derivative trading rules and procedures.  
1.  For any financial trades, always check with Bob before executing the 
trade regarding FAS 133 hedge treatment.  Rod emphasized the fluid nature of 
the FAS 133 interpretations, so getting the experts involved early is 
critical.  If we decide a trade ought to qualify for hedge accounting, the 
key facts need to be written up and given to the auditors for sign off on the 
same day the trade is executed. 
2.  For trades that qualify as hedges, in addition to (1) above, Kent and 
Dave Nuebauer need to sign off on the trade.  
3.  For trades that don't qualify as hedges, a higher level of approval is 
essential.  Until we get a formal set of rules in place and are up and 
running with our ability to calculate VAR, etc., I would suggest that all 
trades must be approved by Danny and Rod.  I would also suggest that legal 
approval be obtained from either me or Mike Moran.
4.  Sue and Morgan should be allowed to enter into trades, as well as Kent, 
consistent with the above guidelines.  Enron does not require that all trades 
be executed by officers, and that approach should work here also so long as 
items (1)-(3) are adhered to.

I believe these rules are clear and can be adhered to without much 
interpretation or administrative burden.  If anyone has a concern regarding 
this approach, please give me a call.  DF

The following is a memo from accounting containing some new accounting codes 
you should be aware of.  I should warn you that your timesheets must be 
approved by your supervisor; therefore, Code 5604 should not be used.  


 
It has come to our attention recently that many  of you have been turning
in timesheets that specify large amounts of  "Miscellaneous? Unproductive
Time" (Code 5309). To our  department, unproductive time isn't a problem.
What is a problem, however, is  not knowing exactly what you are doing
during your unproductive time.  Attached below is a sheet specifying a
tentative extended job code list based  on our observations of employee
activities. 

The list will allow you  to specify with a fair amount of precision what
you are doing during your  unproductive time. Please begin using this job
code list immediately and let  us know about any difficulties you
encounter. 

Thank  you,
Accounting.

Here's a thought that didn't occur to me when I marked up the mock trial 
script.  Should we have the consultants prominantly feature "IPEC 
Busters"???  Unless we are pretty sure the judge will keep it out on 
relevance grounds, it might be useful to at least get some juror reactions to 
it.  With or without the specific IPEC Busters stuff, we probably ought to 
assume that Jad's theme will be that Northern's whole philosophy was to 
breach contracts without flinching if it served our commercial interests.  
The vitriol from P&P and the other producers plays into that theme.  Maybe we 
ought to spice that part of the script up a bit also just so we can see how 
our response plays.  DF

Subcontract Agreement with Instromet to Integrate Changes Requested by 
Instromet in Dec. 1999 and Other EM&MS Edits


	

The below note outlines the changes I made to the Enron Machine and 
Mechanical Services, Inc. (Clifton machine shop) Subcontract Agreement with 
Instromet per Instromet's requested changes that Randy Rice and Rick Craig 
accepted.  In the course of editing this Agreement, I rearranged certain 
provisions to clarify the indemnity obligations of the parties, and the 
representations and warranties of the parties. The latter changes are 
described below.  

Instromet has not yet seen this revised Agreement.   GPG Procurement and 
Supply will be meeting with Instromet this Thursday, January 27th, and would 
like to execute the agreement that day.  The plan is to send the attached 
agreement to Instromet no later than the close of GPG's business today.  
Please review the below changes as well as  Exhibit A, Scope of Work, and 
Exhibit B, Unit Price List, and advise me as soon as possible today of any 
concerns you may have.  Thank you for your help in finalizing this agreement.

Subject: Edits Made to Enron Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc. 
Subcontract Agreement with Instromet to Integrate Changes Requested by 
Instromet in Dec. 1999 and Other EM&MS Edits

Part II, Section 1, Definitions.

Modified to replace the definition of "Test Period" with "Warranty Period", 
and to define the latter as "the period of time up to 30 days from the date 
Instromet receives the shipment of Work at Instromet's first point of 
destination".  Instromet's right to reject the completed Work by notifying 
Enron Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc. (EM&MS) in writing of the alleged 
defect must be exercised by Instromet during the Warranty Period or this 
right is waived.   Instromet's sole remedy for defective goods is the repair 
or replacement by EM&MS.

Part II, Section 6.2, Instromet Furnished Information, Data, Material, 
Equipment Services.

Modified to limit Instromet's liability for consequences of defects in 
manufactured spools to defects in the data, material, equipment, supplies or 
services furnished by or through Instromet.  Original draft also made 
Instromet liable for defects in supplies or services furnished by Enron 
Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc.

Part II, Section 11, Title and Risk of Loss to Work.

Modified to transfer title and all risk of loss in the Work to Instromet as 
of the date of Enron Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc.'s invoice 
statement to Instromet (whether or not Instromet has arranged for the 
shipment of the completed spools).  Original draft placed risk of loss in the 
Work with Instromet at all times, and identified the Point of Delivery 
(Clifton machine shop) as the place of title-transfer.  

Part II, Section 12, Changes.

Modified to provide for the completion of a Work Change Order form (attached 
to the Agreement as Exhibit C) to document changes in Work agreed to by the 
parties.

Part II, Section 13, Standards of Performance and Limited Warranty.

Modified to integrate the new Warranty Period definition discussed in the 
first bullet item above.  Also modified to treat as a separate numbered 
section (Section 9, Indemnification for Third Party Claims) the indemnity 
obligation (regardless of the presence or absence of insurance coverage) of 
Instromet to EM&MS  for third party claims for personal injury or property 
damage arising from EM&MS' Work .  Section 9 is further modified to expressly 
exclude from Instromet's indemnity obligation the percentage of any claim 
that results from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of 
EM&MS. Section 9 is also modified to state the right of EM&MS to assume its 
defense of a third party claim if Instromet fails to assume the same per its 
indemnity obligation on being notified of the claim.  

Please note that under Section 8, Liabilities and Indemnifications for Other 
Than Third Party Claims, Instromet and EM&MS have agreed to release and hold 
each other harmless for claims of injury or death of person or loss or damage 
to property in favor of each party or its employees or its agents arising 
from the Work of EM&MS at the Clifton machine shop.  Claims by Instromet's or 
EM&MS's independent contractors would be third party claims coverd by Section 
9.

Part II,  Hazardous Materials, Waste, Pollution Section.

This  section was deleted in its entirety.  Section 9, Indemnification for 
Third Party Claims, will cover the respective responsibilities of the parties 
for such claims.

Part II, Intellectual Property Rights Section.

Instromet was to provide EM&MS with its proposed alternate language for this 
section.  EM&MS has not received this.  Therefore, this separate Section was 
deleted by EM&MS and two of its provisions integrated elsewhere in the 
Agreement.  The first, the provision concerning Instromet's representations 
and warranties of ownership of the processes and methods that Instromet 
requires EM&MS to use in its manufacture of the spools has been set out in a 
separate section, Section 14, Instromet's Representations and Warranties.  
Section 14 now stipulates that Instromet warrants that either Instromet, Inc. 
or its "Affiliate" own such processes or methods used in the Work and that 
all products provided by Instromet are free from third party claims of 
infringement of intellectual property rights.  The second, the provision in 
the original "Intellectual Propery Rights" section concerning Instromet's 
obligation to indemnify EM&MS from third party intellectual property 
infringement claims has been removed and integrated into Section 9, 
Indemnification for Third Party Claims.

Lastly, please note that Section 22.5, Confidential Information,  now states 
that the parties' obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure shall 
continue for a period of 3 years after the termination of this Agreement.  
The original draft had stipulated that the confidentiality obligations shall 
terminate ___ years after the date of the disclosure of such confidential 
information.  The change was made based on the difficulty of tracking 
different disclosure dates through the term of the Agreement.

it to him yet.  My tiering thing will follow shortly for your review.  Dari, 
please take a look and let me know if you have any heartburn about deleting 
Par. 7.   It is in the standard form OBA, but it is inconsistent with the new

Drew, I will send the agreement over shortly.  I wanted you to review the
following.  I suggest inserting it as a new paragraph.

 MidAmerican and NNG understand and agree that the original November 29, 1994 
Cedar Rapids and Quad Cities Operational Balancing Agreements ("the OBA's") 
provide for volumetric resolution of imbalances and were not intended to be 
subject to the mandatory cash out provisions of NNG's Ferc Gas Tariff.  
MidAmerican and NNG further understand and agree that the Agreements, as 
clarified
herein, reflect the exclusive manner in which imbalances applicable to NNG
Station Nos.'s 54227 and 62858 will be incurred, valued and resolved.
MidAmerican and NNG acknowledge Northern has filed previously (e.g., Docket
No. RP00-404) and may file from time to time hereafter, to modify or
otherwise affect the manner in which imbalances are valued and resolved on
NNG's system.  Unless otherwise mutually agreed by written amendments to the
Agreements, MidAmerican and NNG expressly agree that any such modifications
or changes, whether approved by FERC or not, shall not modify or affect the
manner in which imbalances applicable to MidAmerican's OBA's are incurred,
valued or resolved.  Consistent with this agreement, MidAmerican and NNG 
agree that Section 7 of the OBA's is hereby deleted in its entirety.

A couple of additional thoughts on this morning's conversation: 
 
1.  if we really think the next 6 or 8 months will sort out the takeaway and 
receipt point capacity issues, why not bet the whole farm and try to hold 
onto the whole 150 mm/d until next winter or fall and see if the perceived 
value goes up?  We could tell Calpine "no" on their bid and hold them off for 
several months "negotiating" if that's what we thought would lead to the best 
value.  I don't personally think this would be a prudent approach, but its 
where our logic leads in the extreme, so we'd better be prepared to explain 
why getting the bird in the hand from Calpine is smart.  

2.  We'll research the question of whether we can reject any recourse bids 
that come in over the next 6-8 months if we decide to hold onto the 60 mm/d 
for awhile.  I've thought about it a bit more and I'm pretty sure you're not 
going to like the answer.  First, FERC says we've got to have a recourse rate 
in place for all capacity, new or old.  One reason is that there needs to be 
a max rate that applies to long term capacity releases.  We have the option 
on new projects to go with the existing max tariff rate or a new 
incrementally designed rate.  We are going with the existing tariff rate on 
RedRock.  Fine, but that makes the existing rate the recourse rate for all 
purposes.  FERC's logic will be that TW could sell all of the RedRock 
capacity at recourse rates (currently $.38) and never suffer a revenue 
shortfall even if future rate cases reduce TW's overall rates, because the 
costs of all TW's facilities--including the new project--will be considered 
in the next rate case.  Think about it--our rates will only go down in the 
future if the ENTIRE cost of service goes down.  We'd never "lose money" on 
RedRock, but we might not make as much as we could have made with an 15 year 
fixed $.38 negotiated rate.

There is another  approach.  We could have Mavrix submit a binding bid right 
now for the 60 mm/d and just flat out sell it to them.  That would send a 
pretty strong signal to the market that we are serious about deadlines.  The 
downside of that aggressive approach is that it would get us into the same 
mess that El Paso finally got themselves out of, with Amoco, Dynegy and the 
whole gang beating the crap out of us.  I'm not to fired up about this 
approach for that reason.  I'll give you a call Monday after I've picked our 
best regulatory brains on these issues.  DF

Subject: TW Gas Sales: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

In anticipation of potential litigation involving TW's operational 
activities, please prepare an analysis for me of the reasons for TW's sale of 
excess natural gas at the California border.  I am aware of several of these 
sales and have been  informed that excess pressure at the border is the basic 
reason for them.  I'd like a more specific explanation that includes the 
following information:
1.  What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make 
it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border?  
2.  What is the process that is followed to make such a determination?
3.  Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an 
operational sale is necessary?
4.  In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do 
those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to 
previous years?
5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision 
to make a sale is reached? 

Thanks for your attention to this request.  Please give me a call to discuss 
and please designate your response as "Privileged and Confidential, Attorney 
Client Privileged."

Give me a call when you get the chance to look at this and I'll update you on 
the discussion we had yesterday on automating the request for service 
process.  Shelley, Tony and myself got comfortable that with a few changes to 
the verbiage a customer sees before he clicks on a parcel of capacity, and 
with a couple of minor limitations on the capacity we sell (i.e., no Subpart 
B-restricted 311 capacity parcels) Northern will be able to treat a 
customer's click on a parcel of capacity as submission of a request for 
service.

FERC Audit CWIP.  The FERCERS  wil be in Omaha Monday afternoon.  Gary, Vince 
and myself have talked to the Regulatory Group about the Budget Item v. 
project issue they had and i believe we are comfortable with the issue.  We 
also briefed Keith and Ray Smith on the format and likely questions focusing 
on "controls".

Also at some future staff meeting I would like to volunteer Kim Watson and 
Martha Janousek to speak about Revenue Management and where we are in the 
process now.  Maybe i can do alittle on business mthod patents which is 
something we are starting to look at.

That, my man, is the $64 question.  Kim and Rockie are nailing this down 
first thing monday AM.  The result of our conversation on Friday with Conoco 
was that if we own it, they want it, and if we don't own it, we'd better not 
convey it to them.  Clever devils, they are forcing us to determine exactly 
what it is that we own!  Talk to you tomorrow.  DF

There is a 6" lateral pipeline located in Sec. 34-T18S, R36E, Lea County,
NM.  If this is part of the deal I will need to see the right-of-way
documentation for this pipeline.

Subject: daily firm on TW

The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into 
discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The 
standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that 
the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these 
discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were 
once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than 
a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1 
agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only 
applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement 
does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the 
shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not 
guaranteeing a shipper "daily" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The 
discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date.
Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an 
answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have 
discussed this and he is on board. Thanks.

Any news on looking at the NiSource storage stuff?  Have we gotten the packet 
from Chase or whichever investment banker guys you talked to?  I heard again 
from a non-Enron source that "Enron is looking at the MHP assets" so it must 
be true!  Thanks.   DF

I'm sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of 
activity lately related to Enron's evaluation of possible acquisitions.  John 
Goodpasture's group has kept a large number of ET&S people engaged in looking 
at a number of potential deals.  While these deal evaluation projects have 
become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are 
extremely confidential.  Even after a potential seller has announced that it 
is up for sale, the fact that Enron is looking at a potential deal, as well 
as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential.  

I realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees 
of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the 
future.  If you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at 
the target company asks whether Enron is evaluating the contact's company or 
assets, the only appropriate response is that Enron personnel are not 
permitted to discuss potential acquisitions.  Please be aware that the 
confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition 
evaluation process preclude any communication by Enron people with employees 
of the target company.  

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do 
not hesitate to give me a call.  Thank you for your assistance.  
DF

After a tumultuous Election Day full of constant changes in the projections=
,
the identity of the next president of the United States was still unknown
as of Wednesday morning, Nov. 8. The identity of the next U.S. president
will be determined by a vote recount in Florida, which must be completed
by the close of business Thursday, state election officials said. Tuesday's
national vote count is so close, as is the number of electoral votes won
by GOP candidate George W. Bush and Democrat Vice President Al Gore, that
the presidential election is too close to call. It is also possible that
one candidate could win the Electoral College vote and the other win the
popular vote, which hasn't happened in a hundred years.

ANALYSIS: Well, it certainly has been a history-making Election Day. I
was prepared to analyze the future of the energy industry, based on which
presidential candidate had been elected yesterday. As the candidates have
such polarized platforms with regard to energy issues, it is not an=20
overestimation
to say that many critical energy issues hinge on this election. As we await
the final (and accurate) announcement of who is the next U.S. president,
which may not come for another day or so, it is a good time to review how
each candidate intends to address low domestic supplies of oil and natural
gas, the status of deregulation, the development of renewable energy, and
the high cost of energy due to recent price spikes.

Throughout the campaign, Bush criticized the Clinton-Gore Administration
for not developing a comprehensive energy policy. Rather than developing
an effective energy policy, Bush accused Gore of raising gasoline taxes,
discouraging domestic production of oil and natural gas, and failing to
anticipate the oil and natural-gas price spikes that have occurred this
year. Bush also was very critical of President Clinton's decision to tap
into the Strategic Reserve Fund in September and release 30 million barrels
of crude oil from the nation's emergency oil stockpile.  As the United
States now enters a so-called "energy crisis," brought about primarily
as a result of rising demand and diminishing supplies, Bush has outlined
an energy policy that includes more than 20 initiatives. I can't address
all of them, but have identified the key policies that will likely unfold
under a Bush administration. Perhaps the best summary of Bush's energy
policy is that he supports a comprehensive approach to ensuring U.S. energy
security, and intends to accomplish this by expanding domestic resources,
using a range of fuels and technologies, supporting ongoing deregulation
of the industry, and providing energy assistance to low-income households.


Reduce American dependence on foreign supplies of oil. Bush repeatedly
made the case that, since 1960, U.S. energy demand has more than doubled,
far outstripping domestic production. Today, the United States consumes
approximately one-third of the world's energy, and approximately 28 percent
of our usage comes from foreign sources. Bush contends that U.S. dependence
on foreign oil has increased from 50 percent in 1993 to 56 percent today,
and that oil imports are projected to increase to 15 million barrels per
day by 2010. To remedy this, Bush supports the development of domestic
sources for oil, natural gas and renewable energy. Specifically, Bush has
proposed opening 8 percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to=20
"environmentally
responsible and regulated exploration," with the intent of replacing the
oil that the United States now imports from Iraq. Regarding natural gas,
Bush will examine whether certain promising natural-gas reserves in federal
lands should be opened for exploration. Yet, it's important to note that
Bush is not suggesting that domestic supply of oil and natural gas will
be sufficient. Rather, he recognizes that access to an adequate supply
of foreign oil and gas is strategically important to the United States
and the global economy. However, instead of relying predominantly on Iraq=
=01*
especially
as Saddam Hussein threatens to reduce production=01*Bush will work more clo=
sely
with Canada and Mexico to increase cross-border flows of oil, natural gas
and electricity within North America.

Support new pipeline construction. As domestic production of oil and natura=
l
gas increases to meet growing demand, Bush also supports the construction
of new pipelines, and would expand refining capacity by tearing down=20
"regulatory
hurdles." Bush has referenced the National Petroleum Council's estimates
that the gas industry will require 38,000 miles of new transmission pipelin=
es
and 255,000 miles of distribution lines by 2015. Bush sees a need for new
pipelines and distribution lines in the Midwest in particular, where=20
traditional
coal plants should ultimately be replaced by gas-fired plants.

Support the growth of renewable energy. Bush supports the development of
renewable and low-emission fuels, and has committed to investing $2 billion
over 10 years to fund "clean-coal technologies" and $1 billion over 10
years to help utilities purchase nuclear plants. At the same time, Bush
will propose legislation requiring utilities to reduce harmful emissions
from their generation plants, and offer tax credits for power produced
from alternative or renewable fuels. However, Bush recognizes that while
renewable energy is important, it currently accounts for less than 4 percen=
t
of the total U.S. energy consumption. Consequently, for the foreseeable
future, Bush contends that hydrocarbons=01*oil, coal and natural gas=01*wil=
l
continue to play the primary role in meeting the growing energy needs of
Americans.

Support electric deregulation. Bush supports deregulation of the energy
industry and prefers to let "markets, and not government officials=01*deter=
mine
investment decisions" and "give customers a choice of suppliers." Toward
this end, Bush believes that federal restructuring legislation is needed
to "assure the reliability of the nation's electrical grid, and to promote
consumer choice by removing federal barriers to competition." While he
supports consumer choice, Bush recognizes that often low-income families
face high electricity prices (as was found in San Diego this summer).=20
Consequently,
Bush supports the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), the
largest direct expenditure energy subsidy program, which has about $155
million left in funding to support emergency funding for cooling and heatin=
g
assistance. In addition, Bush will expand the Weatherization Assistance
Program, which supports about 76,900 homes by spending $1.4 billion for
Weatherization programs over the next ten years.

As noted, the presidential candidates are proposing very different platform=
s
with regard to the energy industry. Thus, it is not surprising that Vice
President Gore disagrees with most everything that Governor Bush is proposi=
ng.
Essentially the most striking difference comes down to conservation. While
Bush supports the exploration of domestic fuels, Gore believes the United
States should focus on doing more with what we already have, and protecting
the environment for future generations.

Of course, Gore carries the legacy of his Clinton-Gore administration,
one that as noted has been criticized by Bush for not developing a=20
comprehensive
energy policy. Thus, it is not completely clear how Gore would depart from
what has been his administration's approach to energy issues over the last
seven years. It is likely that Gore's administration would follow much
the same path that the Clinton administration traveled, although Gore=20
certainly
has made the environment one of his core platforms (for example, his 1993
book, Earth in the Balance). Thus, is not surprising that "creating a clean
environment and stable climate" is one of the key foundations on which
Gore has established his energy platform.

Beyond that, Gore has said that his "new" energy policy will focus on five
goals: 1). Saving energy, reducing pollution, promoting a higher standard
of living and creating high-wage jobs. 2). Reducing the nation's dependence
on unreliable imported oil. 3). Protecting children against the threat
of pollution nationally and globally. 4). Dramatically reducing the threat
posed by global warming. 5). Curtailing brownouts by increasing the=20
reliability
of the power grid.

Perhaps the central initiative that Gore has proposed is the creation of
the National Energy Security and Environmental Trust Fund. Designed to
"bring revolutionary change to our transportation and energy infrastructure=
,"
the Fund would help consumers purchase energy-efficient vehicles, homes
and appliances, promote clean and reliable sources of electric power, and
encourage long-term solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on imported sources
of oil. Gore would provide consumers with a tax credit up to $2,000 to
purchase energy-efficient new homes or up to a $1,000 credit to upgrade
the efficiency of their current homes. Gore also supports expanding the
current 10-percent tax credit provided to homes or businesses that use
solar energy to generate electricity or heat water.

Gore opposes drilling in federal land, and instead aims to protect the
U.S. environment, increase reliance on low-pollution fuels and focus on
energy-efficiency / lower consumption programs. Articulating the Democratic
position on this issue, Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments
in the vice presidential debate: "There are more resources within the Unite=
d
States. If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars, we'll
get a million=01*we'll save a million barrels of oil a day, which is exactl=
y
what the refuge, at its best, in Alaska, would produce=01(We've got to deve=
lop
fuel cells, alternative energy. We've got to encourage people to conserve..=
."
Gore supports tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fund, as Preside=
nt
Clinton did in September, to increase oil supplies, prevent winter shortage=
s
of home heating oil and stabilize oil prices.

Perhaps the only issue on which the two candidates agree is deregulation
of the energy industry as a whole. This process is of course occurring
on a state-by-state basis, although many states have begun to resist=20
competition
due to current low prices in their states and fear of sudden price spikes
as occurred in California this summer. Bush clearly supports a national
restructuring law, while it unclear if Gore supports this as well, or prefe=
rs
to let states continue to deregulate on their own or opt out from this
process.

One thing is clear in all of this uncertainty. The future of the energy
industry hangs in the balance and will continue in one of two drastically
different directions as the final outcome of this election is determined.
As supply and demand issues continue to generate concern across the country=
,
it is certain that energy issues will remain on the radar of whichever
candidate is elected president.

Steve,

Yes, Dan did ask my opinion on the feasibility of forming a new affiliate 
company (NEWCO).  I know he asked many others as well.  Here is what I told 
him:

There is no regulatory prohibition on NEWCO holding capacity on our pipelines.
NEWCO will have to be set up to meet the creditworthiness standards or else 
we raise the risk of having to lower the creditworthiness test for others.
Under the current rules, even though NEWCO will hold capacity, NEWCO will not 
be a Marketing Affiliate (i.e. requiring separate staff/systems) etc. so long 
as they are not buying or selling gas.  On the flip side, if the new 
affiliate sells gas Including delivered gas), the entity will be a Marketing 
Affiliate and we would have to set if up so all the separation rules are 
met.  I anticipate that FERC's marketing affiliate rules may change in 2001 
such that any energy affiliate, including capacity managers, will be subject 
to the marketing affiliate standards of conduct.  If the success of NEWCO 
depends on sharing unposted information, this strategy is not likely to last 
very long.
Most significantly, when the new affiliate wants to resell/trade its capacity 
rights, it will have to do so through the pipeline's capacity release rules.  
The new affiliate can arrange pre-arranged transactions of less than 30 days, 
but any other deals would have to be posted for bid.   But, I don't think we 
should be scared off just because the deals would have to go through capacity 
release.  NEWCO could do less than 30 day releases at above max. rates on a 
prearranged basis.  NEWCO could also do 1 year of less prearranged deals at 
above max rate,  they would just have to be posted to see if anyone wanted to 
match the deal.


The crux is that there is no regulatory prohibition standing in the way of 
setting up a new affiliate, but it is important to figure out what the new 
affiliate's objective is.  
If the point is to capture short-term, above max rate deals without going 
through a negotiated rate posting, then we may follow a fairly simple 
strategy of setting up a limited NEWCO to buy and sell capacity only.  
If the point is to "churn" capacity trading, then the issues are essentially 
the same as those involved in setting up bid/ask trading on EOL.  
If the point is longer-term, total energy type of deals, then we just need to 
understand that the new affiliate will be a marketing affiliate.

You ask what is being done to further this idea.   I think we need some 
clearer marketing vision of how NEWCO plans to make money (through above max 
rate deals in capacity release?  through rebundled deal? ) before  a more 
definitive list of regulatory steps can be developed.

Shelley,
 I know Danny talked to you a while back about us creating a new company to 
hold capacity on other pipes, etc. What ever happened to that idea? I would 
really like to pursue that avenue as I believe we may be missing out on some 
things we could do. Please let me know the status. Thanks.

Subject: New Mexico First

Drew, as you may remember, before Tim Aren abandoned service, he had signed 
TW up as a sponsor the the New Mexico First Townhall on energy issues.  I 
attended as the Enron person.  The Townhall is now in its implementation 
phase and I want to bring you up to date on what is involved.  A number of 
issues were put in our report, and I will get you a final copy this week (I 
think one will be available shortly).  There is an implementation meeting in 
Alb. tomorrow.  From TW's standpoint, a few issues stand out.  First, 
producers and others joined in our frustation with the native American access 
issues (I did not raise them, but they came out loud and clear from the 
producers, which I thought was fine).  Accordingly, the Townhall has 
recommended that our Congressional delegation use their bully pulpit power to 
call a summit with the energy industry and the indian nations to discuss 
right of ways, access, taxes, development and other issues.  I would think 
that TW would want to be involved in this, if not  a leader in this.  Second, 
the townhall noted that pipeline infrastructure may need upgrading in the 
state.  There are other issues that affect TW not as directly, but that you 
should be aware of.

I will continue to be on the implementation team, and I can bring your issues 
along and keep you up to date as well.  At some point, it may be appropriate 
to bring in TW or ETS folks, as the action items move forward.  Tom 
Rutherford is another resource that Tim used and that we can consider as 
things develop.  Let me know if you need anything, have any thoughts or want 
to discuss.  I am mindful of the marketing affiliate rules and I don't want 
to get in trouble with them, but I am an employee of Enron Corp. so I do feel 
that so far we are in the clear.

You're right that AA insisted on the reference to it being a sale from 
storage. Remember we are explaining a variance in NET revenues, not GROSS 
revenues. An ordinary sale wouldn't generate enough NET revenue to cause a 
variance that needs to be explained.

wanted to mention the source of the sold gas, but if I'm wrong, lets make the 
reference less specific.  Thanks. DF

I'm OK with the language, but I want to make sure everyone is OK on the 
concept.  When we left this (unless there have been subsequent conversations 
with ECS that I wasn't a part of) we rejected Courtney's proposal to reduce 
our up front payment by $500,000.  He was to come back and propose a monthly 
quantity of gas to be paid over the term of the contract that would equate to 
the $500,000, but I don't recall that we agreed to it.  Did we intend to 
leave the issue open for more horsetrading on the amount of a haircut ECS 
should take or were we content to cover ECS at 100 cents on the dollar?  I am 
advised that the Btu number in the letter would allow ECS to get the full 
$500,000 of up front value.  

Rod and Steve--this one is up to you and I think its totally a question of 
whether we want to argue for some more $$ because I can't think of any other 
open issue with ECS on this or any other deals that we might be able to 
trade.    DF

Subject: Enron Tag Line Change

Dear Enron Employees:

 With the addition of communications to our core businesses, it is 
appropriate for us to modify our existing tag line to simply "Endless 
possibilities."  This change is effective immediately and replaces our 
current tag line of "Natural gas. Electricity. Endless possibilities."

 To achieve our goal of a unified Enron brand, each employee has the 
responsibility to make the Enron image a consistent and strong identity.  
This is partially accomplished through correct application of the logo and 
tag line.  A revised Corporate Identity Guidelines Book has been developed to 
assist you in following the correct standards.  You may obain a copy of this 
new book by completing a Forms Request and ordering Item #42629.    These 
guidelines will also be made available electronically on the Brand Site at 
home.enron.com.

 We'd like to take this opportunity to remind all of you about the importance 
of maintaining a consistent look, especially with our stationery and business 
cards.  It has come to our attention recently that some employees are having 
these items produced by outside vendors and are not following the established 
guidelines.  This must stop immediately.  Please use the internal resources 
available to you for these items.  They will ensure that all guidelines are 
followed correctly and consistently.  If you have questions on how to get 
these items or on the guidelines, you may contact Marge Nadasky in Corporate 
Identity at marge.nadasky@enron.com.

 One name, one company....one Enron.  Our recent reorganization brings us 
another step closer to realizing this goal.  Please make sure you do your 
part to protect and strengthen the Enron brand around the world.

 Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.


      Office of the Chairman

California Power Plants Get Jolt
As Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut

By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their 
limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp 
curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. 

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce 
electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns 
that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is 
putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. 

That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S. 
burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to 
shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were 
constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel 
flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than 
gas and generally has been costlier. 

In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San 
Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow 
new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies 
last summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to 
solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now, 
they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical 
problem and into a gas problem. 

One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single 
fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a 
comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas 
and electricity affect each other. "We don't just need new generating plants 
and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too," said Terry Winter, chief 
executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the 
organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies.  "You 
can't look at these things in isolation." 

The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company, 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of 
industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In 
California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas, 
and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating 
plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the 
older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But it didn't 
like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when  they 
burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power  
plants here need to operate. 

The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short 
of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including 
many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair 
after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. 

What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to 
begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and 
not big power plants. 

The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because 
gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, 
but especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last 
summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of 
gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices 
also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal 
units to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8% 
from a year ago. 

"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation," said 
John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of 
Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in the Northeast, based 
on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.  

High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In 
California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was 
$228 per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the 
price a year earlier.

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at 
downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to 
tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those 
receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines 
unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that 
make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That 
latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should 
resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell 
it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was 
that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that 
gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement 
(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the 
transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest 
upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when 
ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than 
Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where 
they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling 
that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around 
whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct 
way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt 
points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes 
line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of 
reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move 
to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage 
line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, 
and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. 
border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack 
back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are 
consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line 
pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I 
can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with 
this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK 
with you?  DF

AEP Restructures, Moves Away from Distribution Focus
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Earlier this week, AEP announced its plans to restructure into two companie=
s
to support a new focus on power generation, marketing and trading. "Our
focus for moving forward, plain and simple, will be the wholesale business=
=01*
generation
and related energy assets, wholesale marketing and trading," said Dr. Linn
Draper, AEP's CEO. Draper added that AEP has no plans to expand its utility
distribution operations in the United States and overseas.

ANALYSIS: First, let's be clear about what AEP is doing. Under the=20
restructuring,
one corporation will hold AEP's utility and non-utility subsidiaries whose
revenues are derived from competitive (unregulated) business ventures.
The second corporation will hold AEP's utility subsidiaries (primarily
T&D subsidiaries) that are subject to regulation by at least one state
regulatory commission, or foreign subsidiaries subject to rates or tariffs
regulation.

This announcement represents a 180-degree turn from what AEP has previously
espoused as its competitive strategy, both during and after the recent
completion of its merger with CSW. It's not so surprising that AEP would
want to focus on generating, marketing and trading, or separate its high-ri=
sk
and low-risk operations into two companies. What's most surprising about
this restructuring is AEP's move away from the T&D side of its business,
since up until a few weeks ago distribution remained a key part of AEP's
core business strategy.

For instance, when the merger with CSW was completed in June, Draper said,
"AEP's post-merger strategy consists of three key elements: wholesale,
energy delivery and retail. The two that will be most important for us
initially are the wholesale and energy delivery businesses." This made
sense because, as a combined company, the new AEP owns more than 38,000
miles of transmission lines and 186,000 miles of distribution lines. As
recently as October, this remained AEP's strategy. Draper told me in an
exclusive interview, "At least for the foreseeable future, being in the
distribution business is a good idea. We're not going to make a fortune
at it [because rates are continually going to be regulated by state=20
commissions],
but AEP is going to be in the wires business." If anything, Draper question=
ed
whether or not AEP would remain in the retail business, as he was unsure
that AEP was "skilled enough" to succeed in this end of the business.

Thus, this seemingly sudden decision to put no further emphasis on expandin=
g
the T&D operation is rather surprising. We can speculate about the various
reasons why AEP would be changing its path. For starters, unquestionably
AEP's wholesale generation and trading business has grown considerably
over the last two years. According to figures released this week in AEP's
Fact Book 2000 (presented at the EEI Financial Conference earlier this
week), the company's trading volumes continue to increase (2Q 2000 reflects
103.7 million/MWh, compared to 78.5 million/MWh in 2Q 1999). (Third-quarter
figures were not yet available). Regarding gross profits, for the first
six months of 2000, trading contributed $112 million, while wholesale=20
marketing
contributed $138 million. On the other hand, the regulated T&D business
currently is characterized by both slow growth and a low rate of return.
Thus, it would make little sense for AEP to continue to expand this part
of its business, as further expansion would bring little value to its=20
shareholders.


This theory may be supported by the fact that Draper clearly stated the
restructuring is "focused on obtaining higher profit margins in the=20
unregulated
wholesale energy markets." I confirmed this with a quick call to AEP yester=
day
afternoon. I was told by my contact there that from this point "any=20
discretionary
cash is going into the wholesale side." By splitting the company's operatio=
ns
in two, undivided attention can now be placed on growing the unregulated
side of the business, where AEP's sees the most growth for its operation.

For the most part, separating its business into two companies=01*essentiall=
y
one regulated and other unregulated=01*appears to be a smart move for AEP
as the two business offer strikingly different risk portfolios. The=20
restructuring
is part of a growing trend among companies that have scale on both the
generation and T&D sides, and realize these two very different operations
attract a different kind of investor. Just recently, Reliant Energy announc=
ed
that it is initiating a similar restructuring, separating into two publicly
traded companies (one regulated and one unregulated). Reliant's decision
was motivated in part because of Texas' mandate that utilities in the state
must construct firewalls between their operating companies. In other words,
Texas utilities must have separate companies=01*with separate financial rec=
ords=01*
for
energy services, distribution, generation, etc. Yet, beyond the mandate,
it is a smart move for Reliant because it can now attract two different
sets of investors=01*one attracted to high-risk ventures and the other aver=
se
to them. In addition, high-risk ventures such as power generation, marketin=
g
and trading, telecom, etc., will not have a negative impact on the unregula=
ted
company's stock value. The same logic applies to the restructuring that
AEP has announced. Other companies that recently have spun off high-risk
subsidiaries into separate companies are Southern Company (Southern Energy)
and Xcel Energy (NRG Energy, Inc).

One difference between these examples and AEP is that AEP has not confirmed
that its two companies will become two stand-alone, publicly traded compani=
es.
Draper has said that the company is reserving that decision until the end
of next year, the time at which he believes the restructuring will have
received all the necessary regulatory approvals (considering how long the
AEP/CSW merger took to complete, the restructuring could take longer than
a year). Draper did allude to the fact that AEP has "a number of options
to consider." This statement may or may not support speculation that the
company is planning an imminent acquisition, one that might dramatically
expand its generation portfolio and further support its trading and wholesa=
le
marketing efforts. In addition, I think it's valid to speculate that AEP
might eventually divest itself of the T&D business altogether. Certainly,
the restructuring does not place this end of the company's business very
high on the totem pole, as it was only a few months ago.

Another question that probably cannot be answered at this point is whether
or not AEP, as a holding company, will remain under regulation from the
Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). After the restructuri=
ng
has been completed, AEP will have several options. It could operate as
it is now, that is with a holding company structure under which the two
stand-alone corporations would be held. Or it could issue two IPOs for
the two companies. Assuming that after the restructuring has been completed
AEP decides to issue IPOs for both its unregulated and regulated companies,
thereby eliminating a holding company entity, it is questionable whether
or not AEP would still be bound by PUHCA restrictions. This could be an
important part of AEP's strategy regarding the restructuring. As AEP contin=
ues
to compete in deregulated markets, it faces an array of restrictions under
PUHCA that, for example, Enron does not face as it is not a registered
holding company. Disengaging itself from PUHCA restrictions (assuming that
PUHCA has not been repealed by that point) would certainly offer AEP a
new level of competitive agility. However, perhaps most interesting of
all will be what AEP decides to do with its T&D business, which represents
approximately 5 million customers that are connected to AEP's transmission
system. Certainly, once this regulated business is fully separated from
the deregulated businesses, AEP will be able to do a more accurate=20
cost/benefit
analysis and determine if it wants to remain in the T&D business at all.

If FERC is going to tell us the accounting or specifically approve our 
proposed accounting then I have no issues.     I do not want to have a tariff 
change with our interpretation of accounting requirements for it, without 
that specific approval.   So I guess we need to specifically ask for approval 
of the accounting.

Some simple questions?





As I indicated this morning, it's not that I "want" to classify these credits 
as revenues in order to achieve any commercial, regulatory, overhead 
allocation or tax objectives, but if all other factors are considered equal 
believe that revenue treatment is the most appropriate decision from  both 
GAAP and FERC USofA standpoints.  

FERC USofA

In the "Shipper Supplied Gas" section of Order 581 the Commission concluded 
that "it is not appropriate to mandate revenue recognition for gas provided 
by shippers for compressor fuel and other pipeline system use and used to 
provide transportation services.  Instead, each pipeline will have the 
discretion to determine whether it will recognize revenue for these 
transactions in its accounting records...Pipelines electing to recognize 
shipper provided gas as revenue must also recognize an equal amount of 
purchased gas expense.  Pipelines would credit the appropriate transportation 
revenue account (Accounts 489.1 through 489.4) and record an equal amount in 
Account 805, Other Gas Purchases."    We have chosen not to recognize 
revenue, but we do want to track our transactions, so we debit and credit 
different subaccounts of acct 805.  The over-retained volumes on TW are 
debited to acct 805 and credited to acct 495 Other Revenues (also in 
accordance with Order 581. However, for internal reporting we map the 495 
credit to cost of transport (expense).    Sounds reasonable to me.    Will 
you be able to continue that in SAP? Yes.  We'll be using statistical orders 
in lieu of subaccounts.
While the Commission agreed that pipelines would not be required to recognize 
shipper provided gas on its books, it did require those who chose to do so to 
record it as transportation revenue, not as a credit to fuel or gas purchase 
expense.

GAAP

Revenues.  Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6 defines revenues 
as inflows or other enhancements of assets of an entity or settlements of its 
liabilities (or a combination of both) from delivering or purchasing goods, 
rendering services, or other activities that constitute the entity's ongoing 
major or central operations.

In the TW proposal the cash inflows are the result of a fuel charge factor in 
the transportation tariff.  TW's ongoing major or central operation is the 
rendering of natural gas transportation services to shippers pursuant to its 
tariff.  Therefore  the credits resulting from the assessment of the fuel 
charge constitute transportation revenues.    I don't think there is a 
limitation with respect to cash received in lieu of gas.  When gas is 
retained we can debit and credit 805 and it's a wash.  When we receive cash 
we have to charge a balance sheet account (Cash) and credit an income 
statement account.  We can't opt out of recording an earnings creating 
transaction.   What is the argument that this cash does not just take the 
place of Gas you would have received and should track the normal accounting 
for gas?  The cash alone cannot take the place of a retained volume; the cash 
together with a gas purchase is the volumetric equivalent of a volume 
retained.   Under this proposal we would charge gas purchase expense when the 
cash is used to buy gas that would replace the volumes not retained in 
kind.   I am concerned that what you are proposing may not work as well after 
the next rate case (since I don't believe it likely we will be allowed to 
continue to collect the windfall) and we may be setting ourselves up for 
restatements.    But I guess it really won't matter, because whatever we do 
FERC will have specifically ordered us to account for it that way, isn't that 
right?  There is nothing about our current or proposed accounting that would 
have to be changed as the result of a future rate case that changes the 
volumetric retention factors.  However, if a tracker is imposed, then we 
would have additional entries to make, similar to those we now make on NNG.  
In any event, the  imbalance cashout  approach described below  would result 
in the recording of fuel retention entries  (debit and credit account 805)  
exactly the same as we now record for volumes  retained.  It would merely 
result in the additional entry to resolve the imbalance by debiting cash and 
crediting the imbalance receivable from the shipper.  

Expenses.  Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5 speaks to the 
recognition of expenses and losses:  "Further guidance for recognition of 
expenses and losses is intended to recognize consumption (using up) of 
economic benefits...during a period.  Expenses...are generally recognized 
when an entity's economic benefits are used up in delivering or producing 
goods, rendering service, or other activities that constitute its ongoing 
major or central operations..."

In the TW proposal natural gas volumes are consumed in the operation of 
compressor engines to render natural gas transportation service to 
shippers...the ongoing major or central operation of the company.  Receiving 
cash from shippers in accordance with the Tariff's fuel charge does not 
reduce the consumption of natural gas volumes in rendering transportation 
service, Instead it provides economic assets (cash) to the company to pay for 
the gas volumes that have to be acquired to run the compressors.  Therefore 
the proceeds from the fuel charge represent transportation revenues for the 
company, not a fuel or gas purchase expense reduction.     I recently 
received a memo from Susan Scott (Legal) indicating that in approving tariff 
changes to allow shippers to pay cash for fuel use rather than to provide 
in-kind volumes, FERC looks at the situation as being analogous to cashing 
out an imbalance, where the imbalance was created by the shipper not 
delivering the fuel retention volumes.  If we followed FERC's lead here we 
would record the fuel retention entries with a debit and credit to Account 
805, then credit the cash receipt from the shipper as a reduction of its 
imbalance.  Any gain or loss on the cash-out would be credited to Acct 495 
(gain) or charged to Acct 813 (loss), just like any other gain or loss on 
resolution of an imbalance.  

I think the cashout approach will probably meet the objective of not bloating 
reported margins...at least if the tariff language is consistent with this 
concept.  If you prefer this cashout approach to my original proposal to 
record fee revenue, then I will go ahead and re-draft the accounting memo 
along those lines.  Any final determination of the appropriate accounting, 
though, would have to be made after the language in the tariff revision is 
finalized. However, if the cashout approach is your preference, then I expect 
that we could work with Rates to make sure that the tariff language doesn't 
conflict with the cashout approach.

Shall I re-draft and recirculate the memo using the cashout approach?

Accounting Memo  

I don't disagree that there are frequently numerous ways to account for 
things--and some ways are better than others for tax, regulatory, financing 
and other purposes.  From an historical perspective before Order 636 we 
didn't seem to have any difficulty recording the proceeds from the PGA 
tracker portion of the tariff as transportation revenue.  Under the proposed 
circumstances, we are charging a fee based on average fuel retention 
percentages that are set somewhat higher than actual consumption and there is 
no requirement for a true-up.  In this circumstance, even though we may call 
it a fuel reimbursement factor, it seems to be more characteristic of revenue 
than expense credit.  

That having been said, if it's deemed to be advantageous to the company to 
account for these cash proceeds as an expense credit, I could support 
crediting the proceeds to a/c 805 similar to our accounting for volumetric 
fuel retention.  If that's the path you'd like us to follow, I'll amend the 
draft memo accordingly.  Please confirm.

My first blush problems are 2.     1) This is really reimbursement for an 
item that is designated an expense - compressor fuel and so I don't know why 
you want to show it as revenue.     2)   Having a stat order will not help 
the income statement presentation of revenues, a lower percentage of costs 
being recovered from demand charges, a major factor if we decide to make TW 
really stand on its own.

What is the reason for wanting to bloat the revenue in the income 
statement?     Explain the logic for showing a revenue item for the contra of 
an item that has been determined to be an expense.

If we go with the transport revenue approach, we would for sure set up a 
separate SAP statistical order to accumulate the fuel reimbursement fee 
separately from the other revenue components.  If you think this approach is 
distortive from a reporting trend perspective, we could classify these 
revenues as "other gas revenues" on our GAAP statements--similar to the way 
we've classified excess fuel retention revenue in TW's 1999 GAAP statements.

I would think at a minimum we would like to have some kind of a tracking 
account (nojn-FERC)  for accounting purposes to be able to tell the earnigs 
impact of the transactions.      I have a problem with recording the revenue 
in a plain transportation revenue account since it will skew the percentage 
of transport revenues collected from demand charges  which is an important 
piece for the financial world.   Ultimately I guess FERC will tell us how to 
account for it.

The Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system is now open through Friday,=
=20
Nov. 17, for all employees to solicit and provide performance feedback.  Th=
is=20
process is powerful . . . if we provide meaningful feedback.

Management, when determining performance ratings, participating in PRC=20
meetings, and providing feedback to employees, depends on the comments=20
received via PEP.  For the users of PEP information to fully understand the=
=20
employee=01,s performance and the ratings identified, specific comments are=
=20
needed to explain each rating, including the overall rating.  It's most=20
beneficial to describe specifically what the employee did and why their=20
action was productive or why it needs improvement.

Comments on areas of strength as well as suggesting areas needing improveme=
nt=20
are both important.  Just as each of us needs feedback and coaching to=20
improve our skills in sports or other pursuits, we also need to know what a=
nd=20
how we can improve our work skills and behaviors.  We all benefit from=20
constructive feedback.

Please actively participate in the year-end PEP process and make your input=
=20
meaningful.

PEP Feedback Tips:
? Provide feedback when requested.
? Rate only those skills and behaviors you have observed this year.
? Provide specific comments with specific examples.
? Indicate performance needs improvement when appropriate.


Some Feedback Examples:


Skill/Behavior=09Ineffective

=09=09Feedback
Communication=09"Jack communicates well."=09"Jack was called on to provide =

that was easy to read, timely and suited for his audience.  The Accounting =

Teamwork=09"Sue=01,s a poor team player."=09"When we got to =01+crunch=01, =

=20
else.  We missed the shipping deadline and our reports were received a day=
=20

=20
goal."
Innovation=09"Jennifer comes up with great new ideas."=09"From reading an a=
rticle on data=20
transmitting devices, Jennifer identified a tool she thought could be=20
utilized in our remote gas measurement applications.  Now implemented, the=

Leadership=09"Tom often displays inappropriate leadership skills."=09"Altho=
ugh Tom closes=20
big deals and contributes significantly to the success of ETS, he lacks the=
=20
ability to gain the support and commitment of others when dealing with=20
support groups across departmental lines.  For greater success, he should=

Technical=09"Bill=01,s technical skills are weak."=09"On three occasions, B=

For additional information or assistance on providing performance feedback,=
=20
please contact your HR Rep or Roger Sumlin at 713-345-7967.

Thanks, in advance, for your participation in this very important feedback=
=20
process.

Subject: So Cal Edison Claims Withholding of Pipeline Capacity

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

"[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants," Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of "certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity." It notes the complaint 
"conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998." 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. "No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time."

Enron Gov't Affairs provided this report on the Energy and Natural Resources 
hearing on Natural Gas markets held this morning.  Please note the suggestion 
that we provide a list of any specific items that we would like to see added 
to energy policy legislation:

Witnesses from the Energy Information Administration, American Gas 
Association, Natural Gas Supply Association and National Association of State 
Energy Officials (NASEO) each testified that gas prices are high because 
demand is greater than supply.
Basically, the hearing provided an opportunity for Western State Senators to 
complain about policies that restrict E&P activity - especially on federal 
lands.  Sen. Murkowski will probably introduce a supply oriented bill in the 
next Congress.
The bottom line is that a number of Senators are deploring the lack of a 
National Energy Policy and seem intent on doing something to rectify such 
omission.  
One specific area of interest of Senator Bingaman seemed to be the need to 
create incentives to encourage pipleine investment.  He seemed especially 
interested in the need for long term contracts to back development
Given that there may be interest to pass Energy Policy legislation, it may be 
worthwhile to put together a wish list of items that affect our bottom line, 
such as accelerated depreciation provisions, tax credits, etc.

CRITICISM
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) concession that the

"flawed" resulted in a 77-page proposal early in November to repair the
situation. The reaction from California's three investor-owned utilities
(IOUs) was immediate and overwhelmingly critical.

LADWP Continues to Shine Despite California's Dark Period
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California=20
Independent
System Operator (Cal-ISO) on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency
for the second consecutive day. The Cal-ISO is calling on all California
electricity customers to increase their energy-conservation efforts, and
urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after 8 p.m. Responsib=
le
for the reliability of California's electricity grid, the Cal-ISO declares
a Stage One emergency when the state's power reserves drop to 7 percent.
In contrast, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the
municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area,
announced that its more than 3.7 million businesses and residences are
enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into
the holiday season.

ANALYSIS: What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman, LADWP's genera=
l
manager. Just two years ago the municipal utility=01*the largest city-owned
utility in the United States=01*was ridden with massive debts and faced an
uncertain future. Now, LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success
story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another.


Let's take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself
from the California crisis. Back in 1997, Freeman was brought on board
at LADWP (from the Cal-ISO, no less) to essentially save what was thought
to be a sinking ship. Straddled with $7.9 billion in debt, the need to
cut about 1,500 jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident=
ial
and industrial customers, Freeman's decision to take on the role of managin=
g
LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task. Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP
with an aggressive reorganization in mind, including the primary goal of
lowering rates and becoming debt-free by 2003.

Early on, Freeman made a critical decision=01*one that in hindsight appears
to be flawless=01*for LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the state's th=
ree
IOUs (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) continued down the treacherous path of=20
restructuring.
While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means
of averting market power issues (due to agreements established with the
CPUC) LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State=
s
electing to keep the integrated utility model. In addition, Freeman blocked
ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWP's trading
unit, and thus maintained control over the muni's generation assets.

Enter the summer of California's discontent. With demand on an unexpected
increase and supplies in questionable availability, LADWP found itself
having the upper hand. The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl=
y
has favored generators, and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies
that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand. Critics accuse=
d
LADWP of "profiteering," but Freeman contended that the utility was just
taking advantage of California's flawed market. The truth is that LADWP
was in the right place at the right time, and maximized its ability to
generate cash via power trading, which it used to drive down its debt.
A shrewd move by any estimation.

The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season, illustrated
by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards. Some report=
s
indicate that LADWP earned about $45 million just from surplus power over
the course of the summer. These profits only added to what LADWP had made
in the previous year. Fiscal year 1999 wholesale energy marketing and=20
transmission
services generated $98 million, which, along with other sources of wholesal=
e
revenue, marked a growth of 118-percent over 1998.

The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped
with the onset of cooler temperatures. Ongoing structural problems within
the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and
warnings of sudden increases in prices. As noted, the state continues to
face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has
been forced off, including a substantial amount from plants that had expire=
d
air emissions credits. A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwest=01*a=
nother
carry over problem from the summer=01*also has complicated the situation in
California.

And, while the state IOUs evaluate long-terms contracts with energy provide=
rs
(based on today's high prices), LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv=
e
generation plan. Among its objectives are to add 2,900 MW of power generati=
on
within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin. The end result of
this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant
supply available at times of peak demand. Also high on the list of Freeman'=
s
priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative
energy sources. Already demonstrating a good record for green power, LADWP
wants to cut its NOx  emissions at its in-basin plants by 65 percent by
2010. Toward that end, just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte=
d
for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los
Angeles area. The first 250 kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver=
ed
in the fourth quarter of 2001, and the second in the first quarter of 2002.
A previously ordered 250 kW fuel cell power plant, announced last year,
is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of 2001.


Along with having no worries about supply, LADWP customers also can look
forward to a 5-percent rate reduction that should take effect by 2002,
followed by a 10-percent rate reduction that has been proposed for 2003.
As criticism continues to mount against California's competitive wholesale
market, it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting
out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago.

Attached is the latest version of the Segmentation Brief.  You should note 
that it contains three new sections-III A (drafted by Mark Cook) and III C & 
D (drafted by Ken Driver).  I received some comments on the prior versions of 
these new sections, but did not incorporate them.  If your comments/concerns 
are not addressed in the new sections, let me know.

We hope to circulate tomorrow the title page and signature block.  The next 
version of the brief which will be circulated on Friday, March 30th, will 
contain table of contents, table of authorities and will be completely cite 
checked.  In the meantime, you will notice that there are several incomplete 
cites or record references.  We could use help completing these, if you have 
the information.

WAY TO GO DREW!!!

It's really refreshing to see someone who works hard (and works smart) get 
recognized.  Well done...
Congratulations,

Craig Buehler


Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

Subject: RC Reports - Salary Allocations to Work Orders

To: Distribution
From: Eric Benson

In doing some research for Dorothy regarding salaries charged to work orders, 
I was advised by Judy Lin and James Weitekamp with accounting, that we need 
to provide Judy Lin with a payroll fixed percentage distribution by 
employee.  For example:

RC - 0237 Eric Benson .10 Navajo Work Order (work order number)
    .90 salary charged to RC

The report to Judy should be for each employee within your respective RC's.  
I have the allocation or percentages for Lou's RC but do not have the 
percentages for Drew and Dorothy.  If you like, please provide this 
information to me and I will be happy to send the request on to Judy Lin in 
accounting who will make all necessary corrections for January and February 
payroll.

Subject: Electric Developments  

I consulted with Kevin before I took the oars in trying to answer your 
question, as well as the questions raised in Drew's e-mail.  Here's what we 
found out...

Steve's question:

What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New 
Mexico (maybe 3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us 
expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California?

What you're really asking here is "What are the comparative economics of 
energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline?"  In this 
analysis, there are a few considerations -- (1) original capital cost to 
construct facilities, (2) the operating cost of the facilities, including 
energy loss, and (3) environmental and other permitting considerations. 

 Engineers tell us that, as a rule of thumb, high voltage transmission lines 
and tower facilities cost approximately $800,000 to $1MM/mile to construct 
turnkey.  This figure is comparable to the $1MM/mile "rule of thumb" we use 
for turnkey construction of mainline diameter (30-36") high-pressure steel 
pipeline.  

In terms of operating costs, for anything over 100 miles in length, there are 
three (3) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission: (1) 
transformation loss, (2) radiation loss (EFM) and (3) heat loss across the 
conductors.  A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3%.  This 
number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on 
Transwestern's pipeline.   

The most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission 
lines is in the area of permitting.  There just aren't many new transmission 
lines being approved.  It was suggested by more than one source that an 
electric transmission project on the order posited in your example, could 
take anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization.  The issues of 
electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation around high voltage power lines, along 
with other wildlife endangerment concerns, are significant obstacles in 
securing permits for right-of-way.

In short, the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be 
comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and 
electric transmission lines, the protracted permitting process for electric 
transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate 
returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure.


Drew's questions:

1. What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts 
his plant?

For purposes of this exercise, I'm assuming we're talking gas-fired 
generation.  Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding 
where to site a new electric power plant:
 1. Market area demand (distributive) and/or Transmission access to market
 2. Water rights for turbine cooling
 3. Ease of permitting (environmental, encroachment, fed/state/local 
regulations, affected agencies/jurisdiction)
 4. Proximity to natural gas pipeline/supply infrastructure  


2. Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over?

FERC Order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of 
conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and 
between other utilities and/or power pools in the various operating regions.  
FERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission 
access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate 
their transmission/reliability functions from their wholesale merchant 
functions. The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under 
FERC Order 436/500/636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines.  It's 
pretty obvious from the California example this past summer, that with 
respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual 
states, particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of 
Independent System Operators (ISO's), there is substantial room for 
improvement (and possible further FERC involvement).
 
"In the open access final rule (Order No. 888), the Commission issues a 
single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of 
service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission 
service.  All public utilities that own, control, or operate interstate 
transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro 
forma tariff.  They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own 
wholesale energy sales and purchases.  Order No. 888 also provides for the 
full recovery of stranded costs--that is, costs that were prudently incurred 
to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use 
open access to move to another supplier."  


3.  How do IPP's decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc. 
separately)?

In my experience, there is no "one size fits all" formula or strategy.  For 
example, in the past we've seen Calpine take a very hands-on approach to 
supplying its IPP projects.  In the mid to late '80's, during the build out 
of several QF's (cogens), Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground 
and dedicated them to the project.  In today's market, Calpine has scavenged 
the gas and basis traders from Statoil and set-up a natural gas desk for the 
purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western 
U.S. power projects.  In other projects, developer/owners and their lenders 
are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply/transportation 
to the project.  In short, projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply/ 
transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics 
and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFP's for gas 
supply/transportation, or whether to take a more hands-on approach ala 
Calpine.


4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care?

Last December, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, a final rule on Regional 
Transmission Organizations (RTO's).  Order 2000 builds on the foundation of 
Orders 888 and 889 (issued in 1996).  According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker, 
Order 2000 makes "a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations 
from the influence of electricity market participants."  Therefore, Order 
2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the 
functional unbundling adopted in Orders 888 and 889, continuing balkanization 
of the electric transmission grid based on corporate, not state or regional 
boundaries, as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of 
privately-owned transmission companies.  

FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation.  The order 
initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation.  The 
Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned "public 
utilities" that are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and requires these private 
utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate 
the needs of transmission owning state/municipal, cooperative and federally 
owned systems.  FERC believes that, regardless of format, RTO's will offer 
the following benefits: (1) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused 
by structural changes in the industry, (2) improve efficiencies in 
transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion 
management, (3) improve grid reliability, (4) remove remaining opportunities 
for discriminatory practices, (5) improve market performance, (6) increase 
coordination among state regulatory agencies, (7) cut transaction costs, (8) 
facilitate the success of state retail access programs, and (9) facilitate 
lighter-handed regulation. 

Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility, voluntary RTO 
formation and transmission rate reforms (i.e., incentives), Order 2000 defers 
for case-specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved 
in order to create an operational RTO.   Moreover, Order 2000 does not compel 
any transmission owner to join an RTO, but provides only regulatory guidance 
and incentives for willing participants, as well as a veiled threat of 
further consequences for the hold-outs. 

As to the final part of the question ("why should we care?"), presumably, the 
development of a fully-functioning RTO network will promote both the 
efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders.  As 
FERC reads it, the future of gas-fired generation for both merchant and 
utility systems, depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission 
system.  Therefore, the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and 
the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure.  Unfortunately, 
sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately 
cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals.  


5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?

Natural gas prices of $5/MMBtu can only "kill" gas-fired power plants in 
those instances where (1) there are more economical alternatives to natural 
gas fuel, (2) demand for electric power is offset through demand side 
management or (3) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly 
prohibited from use as a power plant fuel.  In the Western U.S. marketplace, 
particularly in California, I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel 
for electric power generation.  Renewable resources currently meet less than 
5% of the total electric resource requirements.  $32/barrel oil prices give 
fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas (even at a $5/MMBtu 
price).  Moreover, California environmental and permitting regulations make 
the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than 
natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible.   While demand 
side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting 
resource needs, historically, they have served only a minor role in 
offsetting the growth in electric power.  As to the final point, I'm unable 
to comment on the risk of future legal/regulatory restrictions governing the 
use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel.

When we originally decided to use my staff meetings for "graduate education" 
one of the hot topics was the electric industry.  We all had a first lesson 
on this topic in Shelley's electricity seminar last summer.  Now, John and 
Kevin have graciously agreed to join us Tuesday at 1:30 to discuss recent 
developments in electric markets and NN's and TW's efforts to attract power 
generation load to the system.  Specific topics I hope to cover include the 
following:
1.  What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer 
puts his plant?  
2.  Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over? 
3.  How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.  
separately)?
4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care? 
5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?
 Depending on how deeply we get into these topics, we may need to schedule a 
follow-up session at a later date.  I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.

Again, we may want to take advantage of the recent bump in gas prices due to 
the cold snap, to minimize our fixed gas payment and heat rate with ECS.  At 
the very least someone should have the mandate to keep their eye on prices 
and determine when to lock-in.  

Take a look at the attached presentation.  Effect of changing gas prices on 
Gallup is demonstrated on the first page lower left table.  Give me a call if 
you have any questions.

Jan and  Linda, the issue is how does anyone know for last years base gas 
deal if it has "gone physical" (if Sempra nominates the SF agreement for 
delivery).  My answer subject to your verification is that the POI that they 
have to nominate to is flagged as not available, so when they nominate Market 
Services is aware of it and is to call Kent/Sue/Morgan.  Could you fill in 
any missing details.  Thanks, Dari

They nominate the SF to market services also, in addition to any transport 
they have?  Dari, please follow up on this with market services and verify 
what the procedures are and let us all know.    Again, this may relate to a 
counterproposal we make to TCEM if they barf on the corporate guarantee 
issue, so time is of the essence.  Thanks.  DF

addition to my first reply:

Also, Sempra does not nominate to Kent/Sue/Morgan.  They nominate to Market 
Services.  Sempra's scheduler would not even think to call any one of us.  We 
would only hope their deal maker, David Otte, would be in the loop on their 
side and notify one of us if they ever decided to go physical.

Subject: FERC Asks INGAA Members to Brief Staff on Any Critical Winter 
Operations


FERC contacted INGAA to ask that pipelines call Dan Larcamp in the event that 
they experience any curtailments, supply shortages or other critical 
operations situations this winter.  FERC wants to hear from the pipelines and 
have some time to react before they are asked to respond in a public forum 
(particularly Congress).

As I understand the situation, Plains and Tri-State have indicated their 
intent to close the merger.  Tim's best intelligence is that a June 1 closing 
date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later.  Also,  
until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come 
undone.  If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust 
between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in.  
Has Courtney got this covered?  I suspect he's been thrashing around so much 
on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen.  

I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a 
favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and 
the merger closing.  (the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was 
about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$)  Also, we 
ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for 
us if the merger goes south for some reason.  I drafted a letter  awhile back 
that could be updated for this purpose.  Susan, assuming Steve and company 
agree, could you follow up on this (I'm having Martha email it to you).  The 
contract requires us to notify ECS by March 1.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: RE: ETS Approval Authorization Policy

I think one area that needs to be clarified is that many nonVPs believe that 
if they have the expenditure authority they can sign contracts in connection 
with the expenditure they are approving even in the absence of a power of 
attorney. I think we need the policy to clarify the difference between 
expenditure authority and execution authority. Our various company bylaws 
state that only VPs and above have authority to sign contracts and bind the 
company unless the President of the company delegates execution authority. 
Therefore we either need POAs or delegations of authority for execution 
authority below VP. This policy needs to clarify this point. I have sent this 
to Drew and we will work up some new additional language.

Judy Weakly and I delivered 89 stuffed Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes to 
the Omaha distribution point yesterday .  It was quite a sight to see 
thousands of gaily wrapped shoeboxes against the back wall.   Northern Border 
paid the shipping costs - thank you Northern Border!   From here the boxes 
will go to Minneapolis, and from Minneapolis they will be shipped around the 
world.  Volunteers, like you and me, will place them in the hands of precious 
children in pretty tragic circumstances, giving them a bright spot they will 
probably never forget .

Thank you so much, everyone, for your selflessness.  You just HAVE to be the 
greatest!!  J

Thanks Vig--this is very helpful as I've gotten a bit out of the loop over 
the last several weeks.   I don't know exactly what the reason was for 
striking this from our agenda for tomorrow, but it might be for the better 
since we can now schedule a prefiling devoted exclusively to this filing.  
Lets talk next wk on where we stand with Hanover and where FERC's general 
policy on outsourcing is going.  That KN Wattenberg order is excellent for us 
on the jurisdictional issue, so maybe the longer we wait the better the law 
will get for us.  DF

Yup, went over to the dark side.  On the power plant, I've got a couple of 
guys you need to talk to.  Steve Harris is VP of marketing at TW, and Kevin 
Hyatt is his right hand guy.  Steve is at 713-853-1796 and I'm not sure what 
Hyatt's # is.  Give me a call and I'll tell you what I can about what we're 
doing to help site power plants.  When did you go out-house?  I don't think 
I've run into you since you were running around with Shoneman.  Adios, DF.

Speak of the devil.  Tino called, all full of optimism and questions.  They 
have pitched the DOE a deal in which Dennis builds three 50 Mw turbines on 
the Isleta, and a 7 mile power line to DOE's distribution lines.  The project 
will apparently be 100%debt financed, with DOE agreeing to pay a firm demand 
charge rate of between 8 and 9 cents/kwh.  That rate is supposedly high 
enough to service the debt on a 10 year amort. basis (remember, DOE can only 
sign 10 year contracts).  DOE is interested, says Tino, because of the 
redundant, dedicated facilities and enhanced reliability, and because Dennis 
and Tino pitched DOE on all the $$$$ DOE will make from the surplus power 
sales.  Dennis apparently pitched them a "share the upside" deal under which 
DOE keeps most of the revenue from surplus sales.  Tino showed DOE the July 
spot prices at 4 Corners, which Tino said included many days over $200/Mwh 
and they got all excited.  DOE has done a similar share the upside deal at 
one of its facilities in Calif. Tino says and they have occasionally come out 
net positive on elec. costs in some months so they like the approach.  Tino 
had two questions:
1.  Does TW have 30-40,000/d of permian capacity available starting sometime 
in 2001 or 2002?  (I realize we have probably answered this question about 5 
times, but lets do it again for him). 
2.  Is there someone at ENA Tino can talk to about a getting a quote for long 
term and/or short term power purchase prices for Four Corners delivery?   If 
he can get something the DOE thinks is a good price, they m ay just sell all 
the surplus power forward.  If not, they'll just hang on to it and sell it 
into the cash market in monthly and daily deals.  

Thanks.  DF

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

     Most people are surprised when we tell them, for instance, that 
California state case law back to 1934 is available online for free - 
including the official West citation and pagination. If this is news to you, 
what else should you know about online legal research? The world isn't 
changing, it has changed. What about you?

     Today, as our clients in some of this nation's leading firms and Fortune 
500 companies already know, TheLaw.net Pro Custom Web Browser provides 
unlimited access to our proprietary, searchable database of more than 4 
million cases that includes:

--Nearly 200 Federal and state appellate jurisdictions (listed in detail 
below with date of origin)
--There are no passwords, meters, slices, printing, downloading, viewing or 
transaction hassles to contend with
--Many jurisdictions are back-filed to the early 20th century, all are 
updated daily
--The official citations are included shortly after they become available
--Search syntax options include natural language, Boolean, truncation and 
nesting
--You can easily research the history of a cite or simply pop-up a case if 
you know: party, counsel, court, date, docket number, citation, panel or 
author
--$995 buys five individual unlimited access via our Workgroup Edition
--Individual subscriptions are just $345 for our Convenience Edition and the 
software resides on your PC at work, home and on the road (See below for more 
information regarding applicable November discounts, volume licensing and 
special incentives for AALL and ACCA Members)


ASK YOURSELF THIS:
     If the present and future of case law, statutes, rules, forms, 
administrative codes, executive agency databases, legislation trackers, law 
reviews and corporate and personal profile information is free, what 
processes and standards do you have in place for quickly accessing and 
leveraging these resources on behalf of your practice? In the absence of any 
best practices how can you ever expect to meaningfully shorten the checklist 
of enhanced, premium-wine products you may still need from the big two 
compusearchers?


REAL LEGAL RESEARCH FROM WORK, HOME OR THE ROAD
     TheLaw.net's foolproof custom browser is a plug and play software 
solution that facilitates real legal research for all attorneys, paralegals 
and librarians. Besides case law, our slick software includes a built-in, 
deep-linked, point and click menu driven system for quickly popping-up any of 
the 50,000 best, most frequently sought after web based documents and

With the realignment of ETS, we want to remind you of the procedures for 
booking company aircraft service.  As you probably know, one Enron plane has 
been designated for use by ETS for travel between Houston and Omaha and for 
other trips as approved by the vice presidents or us.  Of course, a key 
consideration for approval is the number of passengers, which generally is a 
minimum of 4 - 6, and/or the difficulty of reaching the destination(s) by 
commercial airlines.  The plane is booked on a first come, first served 
basis.  To encourage maximum utilization of the plane, a weekly schedule is 
published and distributed to ETS support team members each week.

Virginia O'Neill coordinates the plane schedule and will continue to do so 
for all trips originating from Omaha.  In addition, we have begun utilizing 
charter aircraft service for trips originating from Omaha within a mileage 
range of 700 - 800 miles.  The utilization of charters for these trips will 
reduce travel costs by eliminating deadhead costs.  Virginia will continue to 
coordinate charter trips from Omaha also.  Beginning today, Julie Armstrong 
will coordinate trips originating from Houston.  Julie and Virginia will work 
together to continue publishing the weekly plane schedule so that travelers 
can utilize the plane when available.   Please remember that company plane 
usage requires the approval of your vice president.  If employees are 
reserving individual available seats on a scheduled flight, vice presidential 
approval isn't required.

If space is available, personal travel for employees and their immediate 
families is permitted.  Imputed income for the cost of the flight will be 
included in the employee's W-2 form at the end of the year.  Please remember 
that personal travelers are always subject to being bumped up to departure 
time by business travelers and that the schedule is subject to frequent 
change.

Please have the following information available when contacting Julie or 
Virginia to book a flight:

 Date of travel & destination  
Lead passenger's name
Other passenger's names (generally need 4 - 6 passengers)
Departure & return times
Ground transportation requirements (if rental cars are required, 
please have the individual's American Express number or Emerald Isle number 
available).
 Purpose of the trip
 Coding if the trip is being charged to a work order

We will continue to monitor usage of the company plane to maximize its usage 
and provide needed private aircraft service for ETS.  In addition, we expect 
that, except for NBPL, the actual aircraft usage cost will be billed directly 
to the user's cost center in year 2001.  However, the billing details are 
still being worked out and will be communicated when finalized.  If you have 
questions or comments, you may contact either of us or Julie or Virginia.

EHS Corporate has asked we verify this inventory of services/products  from 
all of the various companies that fit under the very broadest form of the ETS 
umbrella.  I offer the following thoughts:  I don't believe EOTT has any 
relationship with the Mt. Belvieu storage operations; I don't know if we 
purchase natural gas except for fuel purposes; do we currently have any gas 
gathering facilities?? or just transmission??; EOTT Fleet Vehicles could be 
better defined; Risk Management services??

Feedback would be extremely helpful before the 17th

Lou,

This is a follow-up to a meeting we had about 2 months ago on Life Cycle 
Impact Assessments.  The 1st phase of the assessment involves completing an 
inventory of Enron's products\services and volumes.  I am currently 
requesting each business unit to verify the products and services we have 
identified and make any modifications to the list.  I am enlisting your 
assistance to do this for ETS, including EOTT.  I need to have the 
verification completed by 11/17. Please advise if you have any questions.



Thanks,

The server that runs the process to backup NNGOMAHA will be unavailable from 
7:00 pm to9:00 pm,  Monday, November 6, 2000 for an emergency scheduled 
maintenance window.   During this maintenance window we will be recycling the 
server to correct an error.  The only impact is you will be unable to print 
during this  2 hour window.  

If for any reason this maintenance window is longer than the estimated 2 
hours we will update the Help Desk voicemail (x7454) with the new estimated 
time of availability.

If you have any questions, issues or concerns with this scheduled outage 
please contact the Help Desk at x7454.

I don't have a problem supporting the concept generally.  Since they took the 
trouble to ask for our help, its probably the right thing to do politically 
and relationship-wise.  On the substance, I doubt this will do them or us 
much good in the long run as FERC will just ignore us all if pipelines start 
acting as cheerleaders for each others' proposals.  Will they ghost write it 
or do you need someone to draft it up?  DF

Subject: Support for Tennessee's Hourly Firm Service


Margarite Wong-Chapman, general counsel of Tennessee Gas Pipeline (and Peggy 
Heeg, general counsel of El Paso corp) called me to see if the Enron Pipeline 
would be willing to file in support of their hourly firm filing.  She called 
because she said that our pipelines are on record as saying that pipelines 
need flexibility to serve electric generators.  Protests are coming from the 
Dynegy/Indicate Shipper crowd that claim that pipeline can provide hourly 
flexibility within current FT.   A technical conference is set for next 
Tues.  & either Nancy or Jan will cover.

I told Margarite that I would see whether I could drum up any support for an 
ETS intervention and comments in support.  I told her that any ETS comments 
would at most be brief and state general support for the notion that pipeline 
need flexibility to serve electric generators.  I also told her that I 
doubted that we could file by next Tues.  

Let me know what you think.  Personally I see some value from cooperating 
with El Paso on this issue.

FYI - I will separately fax you a copy of the proposal to be discussed at the 
next INGAA/Generator roundtable meeting next Tues. here in Houston.  For the 
most part, the proposal is more of the same tone -- we should be able to 
serve generators under existing services.

Subject: TW Gallup - Gas Conversion Pricing



Now given the close of business today and the concern regarding price movement
since Monday I have requested new pricing information again.  The appearance 
is
that the numbers have moved.  I suspect that we have missed the upward price 
movement
associated with the "Winter of 2000" the last few days.  

I hope we can get a defined process to capture a short term price movement or 
we may 
be faced with gas prices between March and April (which is the in-service 
targeted) that 
we don't even want to mention.  

Let me know.

Subject: Re: ECS and the $500k reduction  

We did not document the up front payments, because of Regulatory concerns.  
FERC requested copies of the contracts that defined the payment for 
electricity.  The $500k was negotiated in a meeting with George Fastuca and 
Mark Courtney, where Mark agreed to share his profit.  We had worked very 
closely with them to assure the officer group, how this project compared to 
doing it with out ESC.  They never advised Dave Foti or myself of this 
change.  The calculations for the up front payment was provided by them and 
clearly reflects the revenue sharing agreed to by Mark.

Did we have a contract that was written and spelled out?    If not, (pretty 
sloppy business practice), then we are just going to have to tell Bill Cordes 
that we didn't have a deal, and someone is going to have to suck it in to 
make up the $500K.    If we did, what does the deal say?

Subject: ECS and the $500k reduction

Rod, Steve, & James:

In rough terms, this is what I understand ECS' logic to be -

The $3.35 per KW for transmission demand charge was assumed not to be 
avoidable and have a 5000 KW minimum when ET&S and ECS agreed on the $2.8MM 
one time payment.
ECS says that they have negotiated to make the transmission demand charge 
avoidable with no minimum.
$3.35 * 10,000HP / 1.341 = $25k
$25k discounted 10 years = $1.9MM
25% of 1.9MM = approx. $500k
Original one time payment = $2.8MM less $0.5MM = $2.3MM (the new payment ECS 
wants to give ET&S)

ECS contends that Fastuca agreed to a 25% sharing of benefits received from 
the avoidable demand.  My recollection is that the 25% was used as a 
benchmark to estimate ECS' fee but was never established as a firm rule.

ECS is supposed to provide us with their own written explanation for the 
$500k reduction.  They are also supposed to send us the "re-negotiated" rate 
schedule 21 that shows the transmission demand charge becoming avoidable.

In any event, whether it is reasonable or not that ECS is due the $500k, it 
is reasonable to expect that ET&S would have been notified of this change in 
a more timely manner.

The FERC has issued an Order Accepting the Letter Agreement between Viking 
and ANR to settle the issue of OFO status at the Marshfield interconnect 
between the two pipes.

The following is a quick synopsis:

Settlement  is effective through March 31, 2001 only.

The following steps will be undertaken in the event ANR is experiencing 
flowing volumes at Marshfield less than 200 Mdth/d and, in ANR's good faith 
reasonable judgment, such shortfall will threaten the operational integrity 
of its pipe in Western Wisconsin.  Also, ANR first has to maximize flowing 
volumes of 86 Mdth/d at NNG-Janesville and 735 Mdth/d at Great Lakes -Crystal 
Falls.

ANR will issue an OFO to the ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt 
capacity at Viking-Marshfield directing their shippers to schedule their gas 
on ANR at Marshfield.
If any shipper does not comply with the OFO, ANR will notify Viking of the 
shipper, default volume, and upstream Viking shipper holding primary delivery 
pt capacity at Marshfield on Viking who is supposed to be supplying the gas.
Viking will then notify the defaulting shipper on their system that they will 
only accept firm primary delivery pt nominations at Marshfield for the volume 
designated by ANR until ANR notifies Viking that the OFO condition has ended.
If the Viking shipper does not comply by taking their gas to Marshfield as 
requested by Viking, Viking will permit ANR to act as shipper's agent and 
nominate for them.

It was noted that ANR will not be a shipper on Viking or hold title to gas 
transported on Viking.

This letter agreement resolves temporarily ANR's request for 33 Mdth/d of 
capacity on Viking they filed on June 19, 2000 in Docket CP00-391-000.

Additional Notes:

The ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt capacity at Marshfield are:  
Mich Con, UtiliCorp, Wisonsin Electric, Wisconsin Fuel & Light, and Wisconsin 
Public Service.  

The Viking shippers with firm primary delivery pt capacity at Marshfield 
are:  The same shippers as above as well as Engage Energy.

Subject: RE: ETS Approval Authorization Policy

I think one area that needs to be clarified is that many nonVPs believe that 
if they have the expenditure authority they can sign contracts in connection 
with the expenditure they are approving even in the absence of a power of 
attorney. I think we need the policy to clarify the difference between 
expenditure authority and execution authority. Our various company bylaws 
state that only VPs and above have authority to sign contracts and bind the 
company unless the President of the company delegates execution authority. 
Therefore we either need POAs or delegations of authority for execution 
authority below VP. This policy needs to clarify this point. I have sent this 
to Drew and we will work up some new additional language.

I recently provided each of you with a copy of the 2000 Goals and Objectives 
for GPG. At a meeting yesterday Stan asked that we keep these somewhat 
confidential because of the inclusion of the Clean Fuels objective.

I thought I'd get the ball rolling and try to get this small group together 
next week to begin discussing the idea Drew had about selling the fuel on the 
San Juan Lateral to "free up" space which we could sell.  Is everyone 
available Thursday 12/28 at 10 am?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: RE: TW


 I haven't done additional research, but off the top of my head here's what I 
think.

1.  Open season giving all parties an equal shot to capacity is better than 
selective marketing.  However, once capacity is posted, a shipper is free to 
inquire about it and we should be free to solicit interest by picking up the 
phone.  I can research whether any pipeline got its hand slapped for 
selective marketing.

2.  I thought we had agreed that we need a separate provision that governs 
the allocation of capacity on TW's system apart from ROFR.  In the rewrite, 
we should add language that allows us to use any non-discriminatory 
allocation methodology as long as we give shippers advance notice by posting 
the methodology on our website.  Until then, Section 13 of the FTS-1 Rate 
Schedule is the only guidance we have.  "All available capacity shall be 
allocated under these procedures..."  The lottery only comes into play if 
there are two bids of equal value.  I think we could use pro-rata as an 
allocation methodology if we notified all parties on the website ahead of 
time.  

3.  I agree with you on the approval process for negotiated rates and no or 
limited approval for standard language max-rate deals.  Maria.

Subject: TW

In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial 
team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas 
under the tariff ought to be interpreted.  Here is my list.  Please add items 
if I've missed any.

1.  When can TW "selectively market" available capacity?   I.e., if capacity 
is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits 
on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal?  I 
think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to 
talk to one customer is always "selective" since there's only one guy on the 
phone, not all our customers.  Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off 
the list of "the usual suspects" we call to pitch a special deal like an 
index to index deal or a discount?  I've asked Lee to pull together a quick 
analysis of this issue.  

2.  If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open 
season context, how do we allocate it?  This is the situation we got into a 
couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space.  Are we always required to use 
a lottery?  Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use 
pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance?

3.  What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate 
contracts?  The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW 
discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore).  I think all neg. rate 
deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max 
rate strd language deals.    
4.  ???  I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.  

Thanks for your input on this.  DF

Subject: OCS Final Rule, Order 639


Regulations Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Governing the 
Movement of Natural Gas on Facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf, RM99-5 

The final rule is attached - 84 pages      



Executive Summary
The Final Rule was issued April 10, 2000 and becomes effective 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register.

The purpose of the final rule is to establish a data base as a foundation for 
identifying discrimination with OCS gas service providers.  The reporting 
will include affiliations and conditions of service.  This is a procedural 
rule - reporting only.  The rule only applies to gas pipelines - FERC found 
transportation for oil pipelines to be just and reasonable.  The Commission 
is acting in part as a response to the ruling in Sea Robin in which the court 
directed FERC to reconsider the manner in which it applied its primary 
function test to Sea Robin's predominantly offshore system.  

NOPR was issued on June 30, 1999.  The Commission believes that the new OCSLA 
reporting requirements mirror certain existing NGA reporting requirements.  
Salient points of the final rule are:

Exemptions
Service providers that confine their operations to moving their own gas or 
that of a single shipper are exempt from reporting; add new section 
330.0(a)(1) and (2)   Note:  reporting exemption turns on identity of service 
provider and its shippers - not type of service provided.
Gas service providers that are regulated by FERC under NGA are exempt from 
OCSLA reporting; add new section (330.3(a)(4)
Exempts lines that feed into a facility where gas is first collected, 
separated, dehydrated or processed from OCSLA reporting requirements; add new 
section 330.3(a)(3).

Reporting Requirements
If an NGA-regulated company's system includes OCS facilities that are not 
subject to NGA (gathering/production lines), the company must submit an OCSLA 
report covering its non-NGA facilities
Reclassified facilities will no longer be subject to NGA reporting 
requirements but will be subject to OCSLA requirements. (Shippers  no longer 
have protection against the exercise of market power afforded by the NGA). 
Service provider must list all of its affiliates defined as engaged in the 
exploration, development, production, processing, transportation, marketing, 
consumption or sale of gas need be identified in the report; new section 
330.2(a)(6)
Reporting Updates restricted to four times per year.  
Reports will be based on conditions on the first day of the first full 
calendar quarter that begins after the effective date of this rule; reports 
due on the first business day after the close of the quarter.  Providers will 
have more than one full quarter in which to prepare their initial OSCLA report
Providers will be required to submit a description of their operations as 
they stand on the first day of each calendar quarter, e.g. describing the 
provider's status on one particular day; report due on first business day of 
the subsequent quarter (e.g. filing due April 1 will describe operations as 
they stood on January 1).  If the operations are identical on the first and 
last days of any given quarter, provider need not submit an update the 
following quarter
Not necessary to file contracts but must provide table of shippers and 
services; new section 330.2(b)
Retaining requirement for alternative reporting for OCS companies who do not 
provide service under formal contracts, must provide information sufficient 
to derive rates charged and conditions applicable for service between two 
points; new section 330.2(b)(9)
OCSLA Reporting Form available via Internet  http://www.ferc.fed.us or the 
public reference room
Providers new to provisions have 90 days to prepare and submit OCSLA report 
(NOPR had stipulated 60 days).

Late Wednesday, FERC issued a notice of staff conference discussing issues 
pertinent to Order No. 637.  This is the second of three public conferences 
to be held on January 31 at 1:00 p.m. to be held at FERC's offices. Panel 
Participants will be debating issues concerning the market consequences of 
transactions between pipelines and affiliates.  Since parties will not be 
making an oral presentation, it is requested that written comments be 
submitted to FERC by January 5, 2001 to 1) provide input on how to structure 
the discussion; 2) identify issues and examples to foster a meaningful 
dialog; and 3) suggest questions the staff moderator may wish to pose to the 
panel.  Attached is the Notice.

Jim--lets talk for a few minutes on Mon.  I need a list of next years big 
dollar cases for Lou on Monday.  I've got a back of the envelope list I want 
to confirm with you.  DF

Subject: Conoco

Jim is sending Caren Sweetland the Middle Concho contract files that he has 
reviewed for privilege, good stuff, bad stuff.  Steve Gilbert has my Imperial 
plant analysis and the gpk's behind the plant at his desk for his review on 
Monday.  I have sent copies of the Rocker B-s contracts to Britt Davis for 
his review.  My analysis of this plant is almost finished.  If anything comes 
up regarding settlement, please leave me a voicemail!

Drew, if you still want to go to Houston next week  (Thursday or Friday [the 
20th/ 21st] should be ok with me), please leave me a voicemail with 
information about when we would be leaving so I can get prepared when we 
return from Minnesota.

I didn't get a chance to think much about your budget question.  The only 
matters we had exceeding $20,000 this year that I coded were Conoco, Oelwein, 
miscellaneous Minnesota operations matters, and Guardian pipeline matters.  I 
only coded one invoice regarding Kimball from Jim McCartney so I assume Britt 
Davis is coding and paying the other ones.  I don't know about Dresser Rand 
or Coyonosa - haven't seen any invoices on Coyonosa yet and Dresser Rand is 
on hold.  Jim, did I miss anything?

I heard a great report the other day from David Hill that you guys made it 
through the Oriskany without any interesting pyrotechnics!  What a 
disappointment that must have been for Karol Lynn and CNG!  Sounds like a 
pretty boring operation up there, otherwise I might be tempted to drop by and 
see the show.  Also heard that the knuckleheads from Bath got thrown out of 
court on their antitrust suit.  Shit, all you needed to do all along was get 
rid of me and things started falling into place!!!

Best wishes for continued success--and Siguaw, stay the hell out of trouble!

Try to attend both meetings....you'll be glad you did!  These meetings will 
be conducted by Captain Herb Evers of the Bellevue Police Department.  Herb 
has a B.A. in Criminal Justice and is a graduate of the F.B.I. National 
Academy.  Are you ready for "SURVIVAL KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WORKPLACE?"  Think 
about it.  Do you know what to do if confronted by an armed assailant?  Do 
you know when most residential burglaries occur?  In a study of 22,000 woman, 
who were victims of an attack, what was it that 2 out of 3 did that allowed 
them to escape?  Where on the human body are the most vulnerable areas of 
pain and compliance?  

These and other highly important life saving factors will be covered in the 
safety meetings.  You will be participating in HANDS ON learning.........how 
to escape from an attack, how to safely leave a room without being 
assaulted.  THIS IS NOT A MARTIAL ARTS CLASS!    The instructions are very 
simple and you will learn easy-to-remember tactics which will be provided to 
KEEP YOU SAFE!

               QUARTERLY SAFETY MEETING   Room #227             2 P.M.

   
Remember to dress casually for the HANDS-ON Meeting on August 22.

P.S.  Should we tell him the "glazed donut" joke?

Here's the latest Tino-gram:
1.  Tino's environ. consultants have not discovered any stop signs.  

2.  The Isleta is interested in granting Dennis ROW/lease for the power plant 
as well as the pipeline.  The power plant could be located on Isleta land 
adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation.  Thus, the power 
plant could be connected to DOE's existing powerline infrastructure without 
ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land.  PNM would not be necessary to move 
power to DOE.  Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant 
optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power.  (maybe  this 
could be done through DOE to an interconnect with PNM on the Scandia 
reservation?)

3.  Dennis is using Jim Slattery, an ex law partner of mine in DC (and ex 
Dem. U.S. Congressman from Kansas), as his primary contact with  Bill 
Richardson at DOE.  My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship 
with Richardson, so this seems very likely to be effective.  Tino reports 
that "DOE is OK with the deal" and the next step is negotiating the power 
contract itself.  Tino said that DOE is aware that the capital for the 
project will not come from the tribe so the tribe's interest will be fairly 
thin.   It is unclear exactly how much indian ownership Dennis and Slattery 
promised DOE.

4.  Tino has run into a power plant consultant named Jack Maddox who says 
he's working on a 230MW plant to be located west of Belen.  Tino thinks he's 
working for the Laguna tribe, but wanted us to find out who is planning a big 
power plant out there.  Is this ours?  PNM's?  El Paso?  

Finally, the next key step is obviously the economics.  Based on what Tino 
told me, I'm convinced that Dennis and Tino don't have a real good sense of 
how much $$$ might be in this deal.  They are groping a bit and our initial 
analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight.  How are those 
efforts coming?  

Thanks.  DF

Subject: Additional Needles capacity

As you'll see in the Legal bullets, TW Commercial has asked me to look into 
the following issue.
As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system, 
which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from 
Needles by Dec. 2001.
TW's shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already 
calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity.  
Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their 
primary point to Needles.
The issue is this:  One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to 
sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available, and shippers are 
less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock.  Our marketers would like to 
earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers, 
rather than let existing shippers move primary points.  This will help to 
sell out the expansion space.
I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for 
expansions, to see if it gets us anywhere.  I'll let you know what I find.  
If you have comments in the meantime, please let me know.  We may need to set 
up a conference call to discuss this sometime next week.  Thanks.

FERC Audit CWIP.  The FERCERS  wil be in Omaha Monday afternoon.  Gary, Vince 
and myself have talked to the Regulatory Group about the Budget Item v. 
project issue they had and i believe we are comfortable with the issue.  We 
also briefed Keith and Ray Smith on the format and likely questions focusing 
on "controls".

Also at some future staff meeting I would like to volunteer Kim Watson and 
Martha Janousek to speak about Revenue Management and where we are in the 
process now.  Maybe i can do alittle on business mthod patents which is 
something we are starting to look at.

Subject: Multi year service contract

Per your request to ask AA where the chokepoint might be on renegotiating t=
he=20
electricity contract at Cunningham to backload the payments and expense the=
=20
payments as made; the response is attached below.

First, it was difficult to point them in exactly the right direction withou=
t=20
tipping them off as to exactly what you had in mind.

However, they thought I might be talking about the TW compressor monetizati=
on=20
project...and even though I denied it...that is what they were thinking whe=
n=20
they did the research.   To make a long story short, they indicate that=20
straight line amortization of the total contract payments is the way it=20
should be booked unless there are circumstances to the contrary that would=
=20
indicate a different allocation over time. =20

I don't believe we'll be able to get any good feedback from them on the=20
chokepoint issue.  It boils down to how blatantly you want to skew the=20
payments and whether they or FERC compliance auditors ever stumble across i=
t=20
in an audit.  If Accounting is not aware of such a contract with skewed=20
payments, then we would not be in a position to accrue expense on an=20
appropriate straight line basis over the life of the contract. =20

As to the issue of whether or not ENA should be a party to the transaction,=
 I=20
did not seek AA advice on this issue, but I do believe that use of ENA as t=
he=20
counterparty would double the chances for having the issue brought up in an=
=20
AA audit, since the issue could also surface in conjunction with AA's audit=
=20
of ENA.

The below is from AA Interpretations and Examples "Accounting for Leases,=

1-12. Facility Management Arrangements
In a typical facilities management arrangement, the vendor purchases from a=

company ("customer") its existing data processing equipment and hires all o=

some of the customer's data processing personnel. The vendor is then engage=
d=20
to provide information technology services to the customer for an extended=

period of time (typically 5 to 10 years).

Company's Obligation Under the Service Contract

=20
should be recognized for a customer's future obligation under an informatio=
n=20
technology services contract unless it becomes probable that the customer=
=20
will incur a penalty or loss from termination of the contract.

An issue arises as to whether the sale of existing data processing equipmen=
t=20
or facilities to a vendor that uses the purchased property to provide=20
information technology services to the seller is, in substance, a sale and=
=20
leaseback transaction that should be accounted for separately under SFAS No=
s.=20
13, 28 and 98. An information technology services contract typically can be=
=20
distinguished from a lease for the following reasons:

The vendor is responsible for the financing and operation of the data=20
processing equipment and facilities.
Data processing personnel are employees of the vendor.
The vendor is not required to use the equipment purchased from the customer=
=20
to provide service to that customer and may use the equipment to serve othe=
r=20
customers.
The vendor provides guarantees regarding performance and retains risks=20
related to the operating costs.
The vendor is not entitled to payment unless the required services are=20
provided to the customer in accordance with specified standards.

As a result, generally we believe the sale of data processing equipment or=
=20
facilities pursuant to a facilities management arrangement should not be=20
unbundled and accounted for separately as a sale and leaseback transaction.=
=20
However, because of the customer's continuing involvement with the equipmen=
t=20
of facilities sold, we believe any gain or loss on the sale should be=20
recognized in a manner consistent with the guidance prescribed in paragraph=

33  of SFAS No. 13 for sale-leaseback transactions.

Some outsourcing arrangements may involve dedicated equipment (so called,=

"exclusive use equipment") that is physically located on the company's=20

Some of you may have seen the article in the WSJ already, but for those of us 
in Omaha (who don't typically get the Texas Edition) it was news to us.  Not 
only is the article relevant because it apparently caused the stock to dip by 
$10, but the article elaborates on concerns that apply to a form of 
accounting that some of our commercial people would like to have apply to our 
business.  I'm not sure the accounting rules would permit mark to market 
treatment for transport or storage contracts, but it may be appropriate for 
financial or commodity deals.  DF

Energy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is Missing
By Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage 
earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But 
investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. 

Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest 
players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy 
Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now 
trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will 
be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the 
largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled 
this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s 
stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.


Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price 
swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some 
regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, 
while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for 
electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection 
through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for 
traders. 

But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' 
recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these 
profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the 
details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove 
wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, 
it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too 
aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and 
force earnings revisions. 

"There could be a quality-of-earnings issue," says Tom Linsmeier, an 
associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who 
co-authored the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on 
market-risk disclosures for financial instruments. "There certainly might be 
great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in 
gain to not arise sometime in the future." 

The companies reject any suggestion that there may be quality problems with 
their earnings. 

But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows 
companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize 
from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future 
periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years. 

So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers 
when companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at 
the end of a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural 
gas over a period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies 
estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets 
each quarter as assets or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract 
from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net 
earnings. 

If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price 
specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will 
record an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as 
an asset on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the 
contract is revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is 
increased, and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional 
income. Conversely, if the market value for gas falls, and the value of the 
contract has declined, any change in the contract's value is recorded on the 
company's balance sheet, and a loss is recorded on its income statement. e 

Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the 
methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. 
Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming 
readily available for several years into the future. However, with some 
long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future 
market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those 
contracts. And in those cases, companies are allowed to base valuations on 
their own undisclosed estimates, assumptions and pricing models. 

"Ultimately they're telling you what they think the answer is, but they're 
not telling you how they got to that answer," says Stephen Campbell, an 
analyst at Business Valuation Services in Dallas. "That is essentially saying 
`trust me.'" 

Accounting-rule makers at the Financial Accounting Standards Board have 
debated the subject of how to value energy-related contracts extensively in 
recent months. "Two companies in similar circumstances might apply different 
methods to estimate the fair value of their energy-related contracts and may 
arrive at widely different values," an FASB task force studying the issue 
wrote in a June report. "Those differences lead to the question of whether 
some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not 
representative of fair value." 

Despite this concern, FASB isn't inclined to offer any explicit guidance for 
how such contracts should be valued. "There are just too many models and too 
many different types of instruments for us to have a one-size-fits-all type 
of model," explains Timothy Lucas, FASB's director of research in Norwalk, 
Conn. 

One way to determine the size of a company's unrealized gains is to compare 
the change in the values of net assets from risk-management activities from 
quarter to quarter. Some companies also disclose how much they're adjusting 
their cash-flow statements to reflect unrealized gains that have been booked 
as earnings. That's how one can determine the size of the unrealized gains at 
Dynegy and Enron, for example, the two companies confirm. 

A reporter's examination of Dynegy's financial filings shows the company's 
earnings are highly dependent on unrealized gains from risk-management 
activities. For its most recent quarter, ended June 30, Dynegy reported 
earnings of 38 cents a diluted share -- 71% of which came from unrealized 
gains, the company confirms. (The company's per-share earnings would have 
been 20 cents higher if not for a one-time stock dividend.) For all of 1999, 
Dynegy recorded $115 million in unrealized gains, accounting for 51% of its 
earnings. 

Enron confirms it booked $747 million in unrealized gains from 
risk-management activities during the second quarter, more than the company's 
total $609 million in earnings before interest and taxes. Absent unrealized 
gains, the company would have reported a quarterly loss. For the quarter, the 
company reported earnings of 34 cents a diluted share, up 26% from a year 
earlier. 

But not all companies disclose enough information for investors to calculate 
how large their unrealized gains are. El Paso says that's the case with its 
own quarterly reports, which disclose short-term assets and liabilities from 
risk-management activities -- but not long-term risk-management assets and 
liabilities. 

For the second quarter, El Paso reported that its energy marketing and 
trading unit earned $152 million before interest and taxes, 24 times what it 
earned a year earlier. In an interview, El Paso's chief financial officer, 
Brent Austin, says unrealized gains represented about a third of that total. 
He says most of the cash from those gains will materialize within a year. 

In its financial reports, Dynegy highlights the uncertainties with some 
contract valuations. It explains that with some long-term contracts for which 
market-price quotes aren't available, "the lack of long-term pricing 
liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments 
. . . [using] historical market data to forecast future elongated pricing 
curves." Dynegy cautions that actual cash returns may "vary, either 
positively or negatively, from the results estimated." 

But like Enron, El Paso and others, Dynegy provides scant details about its 
mathematical models -- such as the assumptions they use for market volatility 
and long-term price forecasts for natural gas and electricity. Nor is the 
company required to disclose more. 

"The disclosure mentions risks," says John Cassidy, an analyst who tracks 
Dynegy for Moody's Investors Service in New York. "But I don't know that the 
disclosure offers enough detail for you to be able to quantify how much risk 
there is." 

El Paso's filings warn that "because the valuation of these financial 
instruments can involve estimates, changes in the assumptions underlying 
these estimates can occur, changing our valuation and potentially resulting 
in financial losses." Enron cautions that the values it assigns to various 
transactions are based on "management's best estimate." 

The companies are required to disclose what they think their maximum 
potential single-day risk-management losses might be, figures that also are 
based on various undisclosed market assumptions. But energy traders cite 
competitive reasons for not disclosing more. 

"You don't necessarily want to tip off everyone to what you're doing," says 
John Harrison, chief financial officer for El Paso's merchant-energy unit. 

Echoing remarks by executives at other energy traders, Enron's executive vice 
president and chief accounting officer, Richard Causey, says Enron runs a 
relatively balanced portfolio and that the estimates factored into his 
company's valuations are conservative. In large part, he says, those 
estimates are based on quoted market prices where available. Where they're 
not available, Mr. Causey says Enron bases its estimates in part on long-term 
pricing trends, as well as the company's own trading experience, which dates 
to 1990. 

Further, Mr. Causey says, Enron's unrealized gains don't depend heavily on 
gains from long-term contracts that extend beyond the periods for which 
market quotes are available, reducing the potential for significant earnings 
revisions. The average length of Enron's risk-management contracts is just 
two years, he says. To be sure, though, some of Enron's electricity contracts 
extend for 25 years. 

"We're getting the cash in quicker than you might think," Mr. Causey says. 
"They don't stay unrealized very long." 

El Paso says its contracts have an average life of six years, with some 
running as long as 20 years. Dynegy says the longest risk-management 
contracts for which it uses mark-to-market accounting are 10 years, though it 
doesn't disclose an average length. Dynegy's chief financial officer, Robert 
Doty, says 96% of the company's gas contracts close out by 2002, while 75% of 
its power contracts expire by 2003. "The cash will come in," he says. 

As for why the company doesn't disclose the extent of any bias, bullish or 
bearish, it has in the market, Dynegy executives say that information, like 
the estimates behind its mathematical models, is proprietary. Such 
disclosures may be outdated anyway by the time they could be included in 
public financial filings, says Michael Mott, a Dynegy vice president. Mr. 
Mott further explains that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now 
if it wanted to. But "we don't see that would be in the best interests of 
shareholders," Mr. Mott says, because the company figures it can earn more 
later by leaving much of its gains unrealized for now. 

Mr. Linsmeier of Michigan State compares the current situation for energy 
traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile 
and residential lenders during the late 1990s, though he emphasizes it's too 
far early to tell whether the consequences will be similar. Using so-called 
gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders 
booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to 
wait for them to be paid off, as banks typically do. 

But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans 
earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins. Compounding matters, 
the market for mortgage-backed securities dried up in the wake of financial 
chaos in Russia and other foreign markets, leaving lenders to bear the higher 
risks of many new loans. 

Many investors complained they were blindsided, in part because these lenders 
generally hadn't disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other 
variables. After the crash, subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the 
key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios. 

At New York University, accounting professor Baruch Lev says investors would 
be better served if energy traders' financial filings explained the effects 
of hypothetical commodity-price movements on the values of their 
risk-management assets, and disclosed the basic assumptions about future 
commodity-price movements ingrained in their mathematical models. Says Mr. 
Lev, "I would like to see much more disclosure, particularly given that this 
is now becoming a significant component of their earnings."

Good point, but I'm comfortable we're covered because our bidders were all 
bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.  They are deemed to be on 
notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they 
wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and 
alternates, they could have done so.  None of them did, and most importantly, 
the winning bidders did not.  Our letter agreement simply memorializes that 
we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or 
alternates.  I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get 
it nailed down?  DF

I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in 
the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that 
the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed 
to.   My concern with adding the language below is,  could it be argued that 
not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since we just 
stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different 
rate??

Subject: Notes from Meeting on OCSLA Reporting

Michele Winckowski, Keith Petersen, James Harvey & I met last week to discuss 
compliance with Order 639, the new OCS reporting requirements.  NNG has 5 
NGA-exempt facilities that are subject to the new reporting rules and will 
therefore be subject to Section 330.2.  While these facilities are NGA-exempt 
gathering, they continue to be included in NNG's transmission rates for rate 
purposes and remain eligible points for TI agreements and alternate firm.  
While these points are currently listed as available points and on the 
all-points exhibits of TI agreements, these points are not currently being 
used.  Michele and Keith have voiced concerns about having to perform 
separate OCS reports for these facilities.

Section 330.2(a) requires a report that includes maps and a list of 
affiliates.   Section 330.2(b) requires a description of transactions - 
contract number, receipt/delivery point, rates etc.  

We discussed two possible compliance strategies.  First, NNG could seek a 
waiver, asking that since the facilities remain in transmission rates and 
valid points on jurisdictional contracts, NNG asks that it be allowed to 
include these points in its NGA reports.   Alternatively, NNG could file the 
maps and list of affiliates, but with regard to transactions, simply file a 
statement that these points, while listed as valid on all TI and FT 
agreements have not been used in some time.  

I have read and re-read Order 639 to understand the date an initial report 
would be due.   The rule sets out some of the most confusing effective date 
language that I have ever read. Generally, reports are due on the 1st of each 
quarter regarding the status of transactions on the first day of the previous 
quarter.  On Page 47, the Commission purports to give more time for the 
initial submissions.  Initial reports will be "based on conditions on the 
first day of the full calendar quarter that begins after the effective date 
of thise rule, with initial reports due on the first business day after close 
of the quarter."  What I make of this is that NNG's first report would be due 
October 1, 2000 (based on the quarter commencing July 1).

We may want to considering seeking a waiver on or before July 1 (i.e. before 
the reporting period commences).

Thank you for your note.  I saw an email in Danny's box yesterday from you 
with the same return mail, host unknown...

Do you have Danny listed in personal address book?   We experienced some past 
issues with his email address but, resolved it with new email address, 
dmccarty@enron.com
Are you selecting from the address books or typing in his name.  Please 
advise and I will look into the issue.
I will leave Danny a voice mail message and have forwarded your message to 
him.  It is currently in his email box.

Absolutely.  I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil
and his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking
etc.  We'll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary
on that project.  On the quick 10 million/day that we've been working on,
there's a potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may
get us the 10 million much quicker and at a lower cost.  Steve Harris and I
talked about it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or
two.  We will be ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup
if the alternative doesn't pan out.  We'll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d
project with the Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes.  DF

we will probably want to include in the same certificate application.

Subject: Commission Adopts New Rules for OCS Pipelines


At the meeting this morning, the Commission issued new regulations under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for Pipelines on the Outer Continental 
Shelf (RM99-5). 

In a nutshell, the rules add new reporting requirements for offshore pipes  
in order to level the playing field with offshore pipelines that are 
regulated under the Natural Gas Act.  

In an important change from the NOPR, the rule exempts from these new 
requirements offshore pipelines that are already regulated under NGA (i.e. 
there will not be dual reporting requirements).

Commissioner Breathitt explained that while this is a modest step and doesn't 
address all OCS issues, she feels like this  provides a light-handed 
regulatory alternative for regulating offshore pipes.

Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying 
SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that 
TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to 
disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at 
the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we 
always do).  

If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. 
Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of 
an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

This will follow up on my conversation with you in the elevator a few days 
ago about the above-referenced matter.  Given Eric's departure, I mentioned 
to you  the Unit wanted to be able to help out with the usual December 
outside counsel estimated bills if you needed us.  The lesson that I have 
learned in the past is that the sooner we let outside counsel know how much 
of December's actual time you want reflected (if any) versus how much 
estimated time you want reflected, the easier it is for the law firms to get 
that done.

We're standing by to help.

Subject: Tennessee Hourly Firm Service conference

Tennessee Tech. Conference on Order 637 including Hourly Firm Service
January 24, 2000


Though the conference was billed as a combo of Order 637 and Hourly Firm=20
Service (FT-H rate schedule), Order 637 issues were not discussed.  Tenness=
ee=20
did a recap of where they are in that proceeding and explained how proposed=
=20
changes to daily balancing impact FT-H. =20

Basic Description of FT-H

? The target audience of the FT-H is combined cycle base load generation, n=
ot=20
necessarily peaker plants, though the service is available to all shippers.=
 =20
? FT-H will be generally available capacity subject to an NPV open season. =
=20
Contractual rights assigned to FT-H are firm daily quantities that can be=
=20
nominated hourly as 1/18 to 1/4 of the daily quantity. =20
? FT-H shippers must specify a 12-hour daily service period for MHQ=20
eligibility (i.e., 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and daily receipt quantities hav=
e=20
e to match delivery quantities on a contract basis (not necessarily on a fl=
ow=20
basis). =20
? Nominations have a one hour start-up and shut-down time. =20
? Balancing is the same as regular firm with no hourly balancing charges
? Rates are analogous to storage charges, with three components:=20
deliverability rate (hourly, 70%), capacity rate (daily, 30%), commodity=20
charge (based on flow).

Summary

With only lukewarm support of the proposal at the conference, Tennessee wil=
l=20
gather and send some clarifying material out to parties, but will also thin=
k=20
about pulling the service at this time.  If they do continue with the FT-H=
=20
proposal, the pipeline will file a modified proposal in two weeks with=20
comments due in mid-March.  There may be a follow up conference to be=20
scheduled at a later date.  A FERC order on the filing must be issued by=20
mid-May.

FERC Staff stated that they prefer to keep Tennessee=01,s order 637 proceed=
ing=20
(RP00-477) separate from FT-H (RP01-81).  Tennessee met with customers on 6=
37=20
issues the following day (Jan. 24th) and will file a letter on their proces=
s=20
going forward in RP00-477 by January 31st.

Discussion

After Tennessee=01,s explanation of the FT-H service, Staff asked questions=
=20
about the impact of hourly service on other services, and began by asking i=
f=20
Tennessee could make public any modeling or service studies done to determi=
ne=20
the impact of FT-H on other points (Staff noted that this analysis or=20
transparent modeling should be filed for transparency).  This opened the=20
debate about =01&historical operation,=018 which is the focal point of exis=
ting=20
shipper concern.  Shippers define historical operation as that they=01,ve=
=20
received over time; Tennessee maintains that current tariff entitlements as=
=20
contracted define current service, excluding enhanced services that may hav=
e=20
been offered when available.

LDCs are concerned with losing these =01&enhanced=018 historical services a=
nd argue=20
that their contracts were signed so long ago that many of the services they=
=20
use now were not available or defined then, and some, such as pressure,=20
wouldn=01,t be acceptable today as written in their contracts.  At the hear=
t of=20
the matter, LDCs have become accustomed to access to more than 1/24 of thei=
r=20
MDQ in an hour and do not want their capacity to be defined as such.  Also,=
=20
there is concern over nomination priority using NPV to compete with FT-H. =
=20

Other LDC concerns: =20
? Preferences to secondary rights to FT-H over FT-A,
? Ability of FT-A to get MDQ on peak,
? NPV will bias against FT-A (Tennessee explained that a max rate FT-A=20
shipper wins over FT-H because of total hourly capacity).

Generators, the alleged primary customer for this service, were lukewarm in=
=20
their responses.  Calpine and Dynegy said that they=01,d likely stick to FT=
-A=20
for their plants.  Though they encouraged FERC to accept the service, they=
=20
were not convincing that they=01,d sign up for it today. =20

Dynegy detailed a list of concerns and issues with the service:
? Dynegy=01,s not interested in the 12-hour designated block of time, they =
need=20
more flexibility,
? Ramp up time isn=01,t adequate,
? Rates are too heavily weighted toward demand side,
? Service needs to be somehow standardized for capacity release and=20
e-commerce,
? Penalty rates should not be based on power prices,=20
? Third parties should be able to offer this in competition with Tennessee
? Offer FT-H as a seasonal service.

I'm good with it, but have one question.  In par. 2, does the reference to 
Sec. 13 of the tariff incorporate the lottery method?  I think that's what we 
are getting at with that reference and I'm ok with it, but I just wanted to 
confirm that's what we meant.  Thanks. df

Get a dog???  My view on that is why bother getting a dog when you can have 
just as much fun letting the wife and kids treat you like one?  Congrats on 
the hush hush thing--that's great and well deserved!!  Keep watching your 
back--you just became a bigger target!!  DF

See the attached.  Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add 
Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend TW do 
the same.  I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote 
that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other 
parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution 
because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on 
comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the 
parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I 
would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along 
the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting 
the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think.

With the completion of the Enron SAP implementation known as "Apollo & 
Beyond" in August 2000, a new organization, the Integrated Solutions Center 
(ISC), was formed. The ISC is a support organization for Enron-wide back 
office information systems which, of course, includes SAP users and the SAP 
system.

The web is an integral form of support for our customers and as you may know, 
the ISC recently launched a new website in order to better serve its 
customers and to reflect the widening scope of services the ISC has to 
offer.  

>From Friday 1st December 2000 sap.enron.com will route to isc.enron.com in 
preparation for the final closure of the "old" website on Tuesday 5th 
December 2000.  

All due diligence was taken when verifying and validating documents that were 
migrated from the old to the new site.  In order to assist you in navigating 
around isc.enron.com, please note the following navigation tips:

- Online forms reside at isc.enron.com > Online Forms

- Non-online forms (formerly at sap.enron.com > Quick Ref Tools) reside in 
the Document Library at  isc.enron.com > Online Forms > Other forms

- Documentation (ie User Procedures, quick ref cards, step-by-steps) reside 
in the Document Library at isc.enron.com under Get Help > Document Library

Please take a moment today to visit http://isc.enron.com and familiarize 
yourself with the new site if you haven't already been able to do so.

Questions & Comments

I recall that we set up a warning flag approach with market services last 
year to make sure that Sempra never "goes physical" without us manning the 
battle stations and deciding what to do.  Do you guys know who the noms would 
come in to in Market Services if Sempra ever decided to try to take their gas 
out of Cunningham and move it off system?  Care to venture a guess as to what 
that person would do if a 100,000 nom by Sempra into an IT contract for a 
haul from the Cunningham storage point to Demarc hit their desk?  Sempra 
couldn't nom the gas into a transport contract without first giving 
Kent/Sue/Morgan a physical delivery nom under the SF agreement, correct?  At 
which point we would immediately nom the SBA, correct?  

These issues may be important to our closing this year's deal if TCEM can't 
come up with the corp. guarantee.  I.e., if we can retain absolute control of 
the noms, do we really have any "go physical" risk???  We need to think this 
through.  DF

of vittles and libations.  2.  Good idea.  Tryiing to launch an effort like

#1 - Is there anything we can bring Saturday night?

#2 - Regarding the "record retention" problem, I was thinking that when this 
Conoco case is over, that might be a good time to go through all of the boxes 
we have pulled (probably close to 150) and weed out all of the stuff we don't 
need anymore  - which in the case of many of the boxes, may be the entire 
contents - instead of sending them all back to storage.  Maybe we could 
distribute copies of each department's record retention policy, figure out a 
way for the "owner" of the boxes' contents to come into the box room, review 
them and make a decision at that time.

Great.  I've put in a couple of minor changes--pls crank out a clean (non 
redlined) copy and email it back to me.  For now, lets take out the sentence 
indicating Sempra's agreement.  Also, delete the privilege header.  I want 
Georgetta to have a clean copy she can circulate internally in her shop.  In 
my cover email to her I'll suggest the sentence I'd like to be able to 
include.  MKM and others--please let me know if I'm good to go on sending 
this to Georgetta.  Thanks.  df

I am advised that some of you have not exhibited the requisite amount of 
"pep."  For lawyers and paralegals, you need to pick your reviewers online if 
you haven't already done so.  5 or 6 would be sufficient althought the 
computer lets you pick up to 10.  For those of you who picked more than 5 or 
6 I have reduced that number, based on my thoughts about which of your chosen 
reviewers have had the most direct contact with you and are most likely to 
give a thorough review.  Let me know if you think I really blew it.  For 
secretaries, the online stuff is optional.  If you don't use it, I will 
solicit input from the people you work with like I have in the past and 
consolidate it with my own comments on one form.   Thanks.  DF

Thanks Susan--I agree with your analysis of the tying issue.  It ain't tying 
if we aren't restricting access to the service--we are just offering 
selective discounts.  Christine--I'm OK with it.  Thanks. DF

Subject: Re: Transwestern IOS Approval Request  

Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what 
we have posted before.

One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., 
shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 
or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to 
North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space 
it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying 
to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and 
available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now 
if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the 
Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop 
shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This 
is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with 
the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable 
Topock space is part of that package.  

Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call.

I didn't know you guys were both in the Moscow office now!  That's a pretty 
soviet system your network narcs have rigged up.  We ought to get a copy of 
it--it would keep Enerson and I from wasting 20 hours a week dealing with 
amusing videos.  Anyway, the vid you have been denied access to is not as 
interesting as you probably hoped--its the cartoon game of the guys sitting 
around at a meeting at which you can make them do things by clicking on 
icons--like click the cell phone and one guy calls the other one and yells 
"Whaaaassssupppp!"  Its actually pretty amusing, unless you work at a third 
reich law firm (actually some guy at some other third reich law firm sent it 
to me, come to think of it!  I'll stick to emails with a "business purpose" 
so that I don't inadvertently interfere with "firm related business" (like 
name changes, etc.).  AMFDJF

Subject: Estimates for potential new IPP Loads

Marketing needs an "order of magnitude" estimate for two IPP projects that 
are being developed-  one is NW Arizona, the other off the Panhandle 
lateral.  These estimates are for purposes of preliminary scoping of the 
project(s).  The Caithness Sandy Project is a little farther along in the 
development process. 

I know we've considered the Wikiup location before as being a possible "first 
drop-off" point for the Panda lateral, but for purposes of this analysis, 
let's look at the Caithness (Wikiup) as a stand alone project.  

With respect to the Panhandle lateral project, do we even have enough flowing 
gas supply to handle this load consistently?  Can we meet the pressure 
requirement?

Since we're probably looking at Timberline-type estimates I'm assuming this 
isn't too long a putt for you guys.  Can you give me a time frame to get back 
to me with something, first on Caithness, then on Panhandle?  Thanks.

George, sorry I disappeared for a few days.  I'm back at the ranch now and 
eager to talk--please give me a call at 402-398-7449 at your convenience.  
I'm in and available after 3:30 today and basically all day tomorrow.  After 
that, Monday and Tuesday are relatively infested with meetings and I head out 
on a short vacation on Wed.  I look forward to talking to you.  DF

Yup, went over to the dark side.  On the power plant, I've got a couple of
guys you need to talk to.  Steve Harris is VP of marketing at TW, and Kevin
Hyatt is his right hand guy.  Steve is at 713-853-1796 and I'm not sure
what Hyatt's # is.  Give me a call and I'll tell you what I can about what
we're doing to help site power plants.  When did you go out-house?  I don't
think I've run into you since you were running around with Shoneman.
Adios, DF.

A team of folks including Dari, Glen Hass, Don Vignaroli, etc have beaten 
these issues to death--we have a very detailed set of materials summarizing 
the findings of the group.  Bob Burleson should know that, as I think he was 
at the meeting when we went over this stuff.  Viggy, did we get the info from 
our briefing on the matrix to the no-shows like Steve Harris and John 
Dushinske (and Bob if he was a no show?)  If not, we ought to send it to them 
and ask them to call for follow up.  DF

Who in certificates has looked at the issues of using our compreesor turbines 
to generate electricity??
Also has anyone in Legal done any research on PUHCA issues.
I was just speaking with Bob Burleson and Rod Hayslett about these issues.  
Rod said that Danny is very interested and is considering power generation on 
the Florida system.  Do you know who from legal is on that team?
i assume there may be marketing affiliate isues also ??

At this mornings staff meeting, Stan asked about the status of TW options 
filing,  Shelley indicated that she felt it would be on the Nov 21 st 
agenda.  The 30 days to act is up on Nov. 16th, if the FERC hasn't done 
anything aren't the tariff sheets approved as filed?? If that answer is yes,  
isn't an order after that date required to meet the SS 5 requirements??   
Just thinking about the timing-  MK

So Haskell is trying to play good guy with us on Kansas Ad Valorem while he's 
trashing us at FEEBLE.  ENA is not one of the "largest single shippers" on 
Northern, at least in the market area.  They did that big negotiated rate 
deal with us, however for 300,000Dth, so I expect that is what Haskell is 
talking about.  They may in fact be the single biggest firm customer among 
the producer/marketer segment.  MKM and I ought to whup up on him down in KC 
next week on this issue.

Subject: Mark Haskell presentation at FEBA

I did not attend today's FEBA conference, but Sarah Novosell brought to my 
attention a presentation by Mark Haskell, where he complains about marketing 
affiliate abuse in the gas industry.  He specifically references ENA as "one 
of the largest single shippers on its affiliate Northern Natural Gas 
Company".  I thought that was not so.  I am faxing you the presentation.

Please take a look at Vig's effort to detect price arbitrage behavior on TW 
using the same method that Steve Kirk used on Northern.  You'll recall that 
Steve's chart on Northern showed an very close correlation between the 
calculated arb opportunity and the direction and size of the aggregate 
customer imbalances, by month.  Proving once again that TW is just a little 
different, that method shows no correlation at all on TW.  I agree with Vig's 
conclusion that we should not use this data in the 637 filing.  

I tried one alternative reading of the data to see if I could find a 
correlation.  Steve's method evenly weights the value of arb opportunities 
that occur early and late in a month.  Please tell me if you agree, marketing 
folks, but I think a more logical approach would risk-weight the apparent arb 
opportunites.  In other words, an apparent opportunity to short TW and sell 
the gas for a $.25/mmbtu profit on the 5th of a month is unlikely to generate 
arb behavior because a trader has no idea on the 5th what the cash out index 
will be at the end of the month.  In contrast, an opportunity to make $.25 on 
the 25th of a month, when a trader can calculate pretty closely what the 
monthly index will be, is basically free money.  Using that logic, I ignored 
any apparent arb opportunites in the first half of the month.   I eyeballed 
the timing and size of the arb opportunites (i.e., there's a $.70-.90 arb 
opportunity to short TW from the 23d to the end of May, 2000) rather than 
using Steve's mathematical approach.   I still didn't see the kind of 
correlation I'd expect.  The correlation is directionally positive in only 4 
out of 12 months, and the size of the imbalances doesn't even make sense in 
the months that correlate on direction.  I give up, and am removing the arb 
argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft.  I'll route that 
separately.  

Thanks to Vig, Susan, Lorraine and Richard for hustling on this analysis.  
"Its better to try [to find a correlation] and fail than never to try at all.

I'll follow up with mike and shelly on the person we were thiniking of

make sense to do something more permanent but we will need to look at

i could probably use some part time help with Bret Reich exiled to Phase IV

Subject: Emma Caplan

At the suggestion of Robert Jones (you remember him--one of the growing 
legion of ex-GPG HR representatives), I interviewed a lady named Emma Caplan 
yesterday.  She is the wife of a guy that Enron Networks brought over to 
Houston from London.  She is a "Solicitor" in the English legal system, and 
got her law degree at the University of Wales.  She has not taken an American 
bar exam but may be able to take DC or New York.  For some reason related to 
practice of foreign lawyers in TX, she can't take the TX bar until she has 
gotten a US law degree.  This person is very bright, personable, and 
enthusiastic.  She is extremely interested in working for Enron, either as a 
lawyer once she gets her license squared away, or in a paralegal or analyst 
position until then. I left a copy of her resume with Emily, and I'd ask that 
she please forward it to each of you.  If any of you have need for such an 
individual or have ideas she should pursue within Enron (or outside Enron), 
please call Robert or myself.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

I got a call from Tino earlier today (right after our meeting on Pueblo) but 
could only talk to him for a few minutes before I had to jump off.  I did let 
him know that Kevin or Lorraine would be calling to talk about info that we 
need to complete our analysis of the economics.  He also let me know that 
they are looking at another power plant project in the SW Power Pool and want 
to discuss with us.  Thanks.

Drew, David's printer croaked and I guess they don't have any spare ones 
sitting around so if we want him to have one, we have to order and pay for 
it.  He does quite a bit of printing and it ties up Ann's machine if he uses 
hers.  Is it ok to order him a printer?

Subject: Update: posting of available capacity on TW

In representing to participants at the TW Options technical conference that 
shipper call options will not be sold on capacity that is subject to a ROFR, 
our underlying assumption (I believe) was that capacity subject to a ROFR 
isn't posted as generally available either.  Jeff, Lorraine and I just 
learned that this is not the case.  Our "generally available" posting system 
does not distinguish between capacity rolling off of a contract and capacity 
that is subject to a ROFR; all it recognizes is the expiration of the initial 
contract term.  Therefore, we have capacity posted on our website that is 
subject to the current shipper's ROFR and that is therefore not really 
available.  We found this out when a shipper called asking about some posted 
space.  Jeff's initial reaction was "no, that space isn't available."  But 
when we checked the posting, there it was.  The commercial people instantly 
recognized it as space currently subject to a contract that contains a ROFR.  

My recommendation is that we modify the posting procedure to NOT post 
capacity until we know that capacity is unsubscribed after we jump thru all 
the ROFR hoops.  The premature posting of that capacity is, at best, 
confusing to our customers who might count on getting the space by bidding 
maximum rate.  I realize that modifying our system might involve additional 
time and cost, but I think it's misleading to leave it as is.  Please let me 
know whether you concur.

You apparently didn't get this because my computer refuses to recognize your 
correct address.  Maybe this will work--I figured you'd want an opportunity 
to rebut.  Frank responded (through Deb Cappielo--he didn't have the guts to 
call himself) that he actually held the Gen. Couns. and Marketing VP jobs 
simultaneously for 3 months so I'm still way short of matching his record.DF

In case you haven't already marked your calendars, tomorrow will be my two 
year anniversary with the company.   The good Lord willing (and with Stan's 
and Mike's continued acquiescence) I may even surpass the tenure of my two 
most recent and very illustrious predecessors.  Given your meteoric career 
tracks, however, I'm not sure you guys would view that as a huge 
accomplishment.  Hope all goes well with you both.  Adios from the big O.

Drew, regarding your discount/capacity release comment, we will continue to 
have that language in the "Other" section of the TFX agreement on the 
website.  The TFX agreement is found by clicking on the GTC icon at the end 
of the product long description.  Also, we agree that our current practice 
will be to post only deals of less than one year.

Subject: Re: EOL Routing/Approval - Urgent  

I am OK on selling these packages on EOL.  This approval is based on my 
understanding that all of this capacity is currently posted, or, if not 
currently posted, will be posted for the appropriate amount of time prior to 
sale.  Additionally, this approval is contingent on use of the webtext we 
have been using for other EOL deals (I feel the need to say the obvious 
because I don't believe Law will see anything on these packages again).  I 
also assume that these will be short term deals--i.e., less than one year.  
Any long term discounted deals raise concerns that our "standard discount 
language" is designed to address, such as what is the effect of a new rate 
design or reduction in the max rate on the discounted deal.  I think we can 
live without that language in short term deals for now, but we need to 
revisit this issue and come up with a solution before we sell any long term 
deals on EOL.  ONe last thing, it is marketing's decision whether to include 
in the webtext the provision that says Northern gets the $$ if the shipper 
releases the capacity at a rate higher than the discounted rate.  I think our 
approach in negotiated deals has been to get that agreement if we could (a 
basis run up could make it a very valuable right).  If you have any 
questions, call me.  DF

***  EOL ROUTING ***

Please send your approval by return email, to Craig Buehler, for the EOL 
packages listed on
the attached spreadsheet.  Each of the packages (22 in total) shows the path, 
sustainable capacity
and proposed rate for each product.  The rates are estimated to provide a 
measure for the dollar
amount of the discount (per our current discount policy).  These 22 products 
are the initial deals
being offered; subsequent packages will be routed as they are developed.  
Please call Craig, at
713-853-6964, if you have questions.  After approval by Legal, Reg Affairs 
and Marketing, the
approvals and/or comments will be forwarded to Danny McCarty for review.

Thanks,

Craig

Subject: TW Options

Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant 
changes include:

- added definition of Counterparty
- added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect 
compliance with 154.202
- included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated 
rate
- added an example of how options will work

I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option 
fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the 
fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the 
Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate 
because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be 
nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from 
the market.  

Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will 
have Janet call to determine your availability.

Tony, I need your review and approval asap for the attached E.Dubuque 
delivery products that are "daily" in nature (one is for receipt at Ventura 
and the other is for receipt at Demarc).  The rate aspect is the same 
language as the one-part rates we have already used (designated as "R+C).  
This "Dly" designation means that the term is one day which will be rolled 
over day-to-day unless either party cancels the rollover.  The term language 
shown here is the same as the "daily" language we have been using.  Call me 
with your questions. Thanks. x7067.

I don't know what she is even talking about.  Why does MKM have someone 
"coordinating" the migration to Windows 2000?  Doesn't the IT dept. do that, 
or has MKM taken over the IT dept?  What "issues" could we possibly have????  
Even if we had issues (which I most certainly do not, in spite of what 
everyone says) how could we possibly get the IT juggernaut to pay attention?  
We are all helpless to stop it in spite of our puny efforts to "coordinate" 
or "raise issues".    DF

Are you coordinating for legal on migrating to Windows 2000?  Mary Kay asked 
me (at her staff meeting) who was in charge for legal and I had no idea what 
she was even talking about.  Do you know anything about this?   If so, can 
you pls. coordinate with Naomi regarding possible issues that she has already 
identified.  Thanks, Maria

There is a discussion of HHI's in a FTC guideline called the 1992 Horizontal

Lets defer to MKM's group on whether to seek a waiver on this.  I don't see 
any real value to us of solving Mewbourne's problems for them.  DF

Subject: TW/Mewbourne

Earlier this afternoon, Mike Sheppard, the attorney for Mewbourne, called 
requesting that we file for a waiver for Mewbourne's two projects.  He passed 
on how he had talked with FERC, Lee Huber and Shelley Corman about the new 
Landowner notification for both projects.  He now realizes that TW is 
required to do Landowner notification, but has the ability to file for a 
"Waiver" from FERC.  He wants TW to file for the Waiver to reduce the number 
of days before Mewbourne can flow gas.  It is my understanding that the OGC 
was open to granting a waiver expediently in the event there is no ground 
disturbance.

Mewbourne - Two Projects:

Hemphill Co. Interconnect - 
Mike S. asked why we couldn't move ahead on filing for the Waiver for the 
Hemphill project.  I told him that before we could move ahead we will need 
additional information.  First, we would need the legal description of the 
location, line number of the line the interconnect was to be connected to and 
who is the landowner(s)  that would be impacted.  He said that he would 
forward the landowner's name to me.  The one question that I did not have an 
answer for are environmental clearances required?  Because we are to have the 
environmental approved dates prior to work commencing (required for Blanket 
projects).  Another question Mike S. was not aware of; "to activate the valve 
does TW need to cross other private properties reach the site?"
Information needed for the waiver:

 Location of Work (Legal Description)?
 Landowner's Name and Address (per the latest Tax Role)?
 Environmental Clearances - Are they required?
 

SE New Mexico - 
 On this project Mike S. was not aware that TW had to excavate to make the 
connection to Mewbourne.  In this project, TW must inspect the valve and 
operator (tie-in point) for damage.  Environmental must review to see if 
clearances are required for the required digging.  Because there is ground 
disturbance, the landowner(s) will need to sign a waiver for the 30 day 
notice.  This waiver by the landowner would be filed with FERC.  Another 
question that Mike was unable to answer "is this project on Tribal lands?"  
Another question Mike S. was not aware of; "to excavate the valve does TW 
need to cross other private properties reach the site?"  

 Location of Work (Legal Description)?
 Landowner's Name and Address (per the latest Tax Role)?
 Environmental Clearances - Are they required?
 Landowner "Waiver Consent"


Michele, earlier had a conversation with Shelley on how filing for waiver may 
help the overall outcome of Landowner Notification ruling.  By showing FERC 
how the rule is affecting not only the pipeline, but how it affects producers 
and landowners may help in changing the rules.

Please review and give me you input.  If we are to file for a Waiver, 
Certificates will all of the above information.  Mike Sheppard is a 
persistent person and wants to flow gas as many of you already know.

Thanks

Keith

Subject: New K, Amendment- Sempra, Amendment- Calpine

Attached for your review and approval are three (3) Agreements:

1.  New contract with Sempra Energy Trading for 35,000 MMBtu/d, SJ Blanco to 
SoCal Needles, 2 years, Jan. '04 thru Dec. '05, at a Negotiate Rate of 
$0.50/MMBtu, plus applicable fuel.  Sempra replaces Dynegy who holds this 
capacity under an Index-Index deal for cal. '03.

2.  Amendment to Sempra Energy Trading, Sempra waives option to increase 
MAXDTQ under existing Gallup contract from Jan. 1, '04 thru Apr. 30, '05 
(contract termination date, no ROFR rights).

3.  Amendment to existing Calpine contract, extends term for two (2) years, 
Jan. '04 thru Dec. '05 on existing Index-Index deal for cal. '03.   Path is 
SJ Blanco to Calpine South Point del. at Cal. border. 

Agreements (nos. 1, 3) are in credit and capacity approval.

Expedited approval of the Calpine contract is requested as it is an Index - 
Index transport that will [likely] be hedged immediately upon ETS mgmnt. 
approval and Calpine execution.  Currently, spread swaps would result in 
$0.85/MMBtu gross margin for '05, and $0.77/MMBtu for '04.

Drew,

I just finished leaving you a voicemail message in response to your question 
about a contact in the state tax area.   I'm not sure the voicemail system 
saved my message, however, because it didn't respond in the same manner as 
the system here.
Just in case, I thought I would leave you this e:mail message as well.   

The person whose name I left you in the last message was Jerry Moore (713) 
853-1712.   Another person who might be helpful is Carol Brantz (713) 
853-7180.   I'm not sure which of these folks is more apppropriate for 
purposes of obtaining an answer to your question.   Good luck.

Regards,
AnnMarie

Subject: The El Paso Controversy Continues

Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of 
unsubscribed firm
     capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. 

     Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation 
capacity to the
     southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for 
the California
     Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest 
today. Between
     the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm 
capacity from the
     San Juan and Permian basins to California. 

     For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity 
represents a
     worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and 
Trade, who has
     held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. 
"At least then
     there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now 
it's Enron, the
     owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Dynegy's shoes." 

     But "what's even worse," he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that "after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Enron and
     El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the California border and the Southwest producing 
basins." 

     The two pipeline companies "that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way FERC should approve it," Morris said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity 
into California.
     This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes. 

     "At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts," Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a "closer review and analysis" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts "are not only similar" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy 
case, "but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of El Paso's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor," Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and RSP "operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity," 
Indicated Shippers told
     FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Phillips
     Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas 
Marketing. 

     FERC "should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court 
of Appeals].
     That same error should not be repeated here," the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following 
Dynegy. "When the
     Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for FERC to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Dynegy
     situation. And this is even worse." 

     In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC 
has asked that
     an "anti-hoarding condition" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Enron to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     El Paso for the capacity. "They must make a little profit," Morris 
noted. "We're confident
     Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity." 

     The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed 
fully with
     Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), 
which accused
     El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use 
SoCalGas-Topock as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Enron contracts. 

     He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific 
Gas and Electric
     (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
enable Enron
     to "just sit on the capacity," thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as "exacerbate" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now. 

     The CPUC accused El Paso of "deliberately" filing the Enron contracts at 
FERC just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline "is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized," said Morris. "They did this with the Dynegy contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect."

Rod, I have an e mail stating that TBG has found sufficient funds for the 
bridge financing associated wither E&C activities of the three compressors 
stations and that Pete Weidler has agreed to allow E&C to roll the cost of 
equipment (compression) into the EPC price. 
The compression is to be ordered by ETS on the behalf of GTB.  My question is 
which ETS company will the equipment be ordered through?  GTB has made 
reference of EAMR in the LOI signed with Solar but I question that statement.

Great--the front running ideas now are (1) an operational sale in the San 
Juan of the 20,000 we recieve there and an offsetting operational purchase 
(less basis differential) at some other location (i.e., the permian) thus 
freeing up 20,000/d of physical space on the lateral; or (2) an exchange 
agreement under which a party takes our 20,000 in the SJ and gives us back 
the same amount, less basis differential, in the permian.  The SJ 20,000 
would still physically flow down the lateral, but it would have to move under 
someone's transport agreement--in other words it wouldn't be incremental to 
our 850,000/d of firm transport obligations.  I don't know if this will work 
yet, but it was a creative idea by Keith and Donna.  I'm eager to talk to 
Steve Harris and Susan about this because it sounds similar to a scenario 
that Susan researched  a while ago and that Lindy explained to me--maybe 
there are problems or solutions yet to be considered.  DF

Subject: Gallup Expansion

Today we had meeting to discuss the filing for the 10 MMcf/d expansion.  
Donna covered her needs so that a filing draft can be sent out on 12/15/00.  
There was discussion on the possibility of having an Open Season.  Drew 
covered his thoughts of not having an Open Season and building the project At 
Risk.  Once we are ready to put the changes into service we would post the 
capacity.  At this time Donna has received all of her information is putting 
into a draft.

After our meeting this morning, we discussed the possibility of moving only 
the 850 MMcf/d on the San Juan lateral and not include the 20 MMcf/d of 
fuel.  If we are to only move the 850 MMcf/d, the changing of horsepower may 
not be needed (I have a call into Ron Matthews for the answer).  The reason 
we are asking this question is save capital dollars and speed up the in 
service date.  Planning has said that any change we make at the Gallup 
station will not work for the main expansion.  Drew and Maria are looking for 
a way to bring the fuel or a portion of the 850 MMcf/d in at another point 
(Drew to explain in more detail).  The reason we are asking these questions 
is that engineering says the project will not be ready for service until the 
third quarter of 2001.  We may miss an opportunity.

I will be in early tomorrow or you can reach me at home tonight after 9:00 PM 
(896-1025), if have any questions.

Jeff,
Is it possible for TW to get a copy of the Edison filing at the CPUC?  While 
the article [shown below] doesn't provide any details, I suspect Edison's 
complaint echoes earlier allegations against El Paso regarding their sale of 
the 1.2 Bcf/d block of capacity to their affiliate.  I don't think 
Transwestern and/or Enron affiliate marketing companies are implicated in 
this deal at all.  

Can you confirm this is an "El Paso only" problem and not something Enron is 
being drawn into?  I really appreciate your help here.

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

"[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants," Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of "certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity." It notes the complaint 
"conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998." 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. "No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time."

Given the numbers we got from Mark Baldwin, is this where we are?:
1.  The overall economics of the pipeline project have to be supported almost 
entirely by the new power plant.  At most, we could assume maybe 
5,000-10,000/day of gas load from industrials near the airport, and another 
X,000 from Kirtland's gas load.   This assumed load will ramp up over several 
years (or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are) 
and not be available immediately. 
2.  We know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for DOE.  Its 
probably $0.042/KWh, less 15-20% to make it attractive, or maybe $0.056, less 
15-20%.  Either way, a low rate.  
3.  We now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipeline--about $17 mm 
in the 16" configuration, without the Isleta lateral or the lateral over to 
the power plant.  Maybe about $20mm total?
4.  We don't have absolutely reliable info on electric transmission 
constraints from the proposed plant to Palo Verde, so I'd suggest that for 
now we just assume that we would be unconstrained on power sales at Palo 
Verde.  Are there alternative liquid markets available that might have better 
pricing?  Ercot?  Pub. Serv. Colorado?  
5.  I'm not entirely sure how you guys are looking at the overall economics, 
but to my non-business guy mind, the following scenarios (or something 
similar) stick out as the key benchmarks that will decide whether the project 
makes sense:
 A.  Worst Case:
Assume we build a 75 mw power plant (i.e., assume no extra power to sell in 
spot market) and assume we get the Kirtland gas load but no additional gas 
load from the customers Baldwin talked to .  If the rate for the gas line is 
the minimum rate that Enron could live with (based on our internal hurdle 
rates) can we hit the DOE target power price and have any $$$ left over?  I 
suspect this scenario is upside down.  Should we look at two alternative 
configurations for the power plant--combined cycle and simple cycle?
 B.  Mid Case:
Assume we size the power plant at 150mw (or some similar size based on a 
turbine configuration that makes sense) and that we sell the surplus power at 
Palo Verde prices less Albequerque-Palo Verde transmission costs.  Again, 
assume no incremental gas load except Kirtland.  If the gas pipeline rate is 
set at the minimum rate Enron can live with, does the power plant make enough 
$$$ to make the project work?
 C.  Wildly Optimistic Case:
Same as mid-case, except add Baldwin's gas load and start ramping in some 
estimated amount of additional gas load when NM gas restructuring kicks in in 
2003 (did I get the year right?).   Also, start ramping in some estimated 
amount of high priced retail power sales to back out the Palo Verde spot 
sales at whatever year NM retail electric restructuring is expected to kick 
in.  (also 2003, I think).  With optimistic assumptions like this, does it 
make sense?  

Tino suggested a meeting to talk economics in detail around the first of 
May.  Ideally, we'll have a feel for the above relationships, and the 
transmission constraint situation, by then.  Thanks.  DF

For those of you who didn't have the patience/patriotism to listen to your 
president for the whole hour and a half last night, let me share a 
highlight:  Clinton announced a new $1 billion program for economic 
development on the reservations.  Langley may be onto something.  If he/we 
can get the first deal done in New Mexico and assuming Gore wins, there may 
be opportunities to replicate the deal elsewhere.  I'm thinking of tribal 
lands in Minnesota, Wisconsin, S. Dakota, etc.  Perhaps Bill should call 
Chairman Ken and talk to him about changing sides.  Notice that I'm not 
volunteering to make that phone call. DF

Tino, attached is a spreadsheet with the info I think you need.  I got the 
publication wrong--its "Megawatt Daily" that posts daily prices.  Hope this 
is helpful.  DF 

Drew,

Attached is an excel file which contains pricing for the following delivery 
points January 1, 1999 through 
April 30, 2000:

 Four Corners
 Palo Verde
 Mead Nevada
 Southwest Power Pool

Let me know if you want any additional information.  We can get April 30, 
2000 to present information.  I just
have to call RDI--they put it out by quarter so at the end of July we will 
get the next disk.  They'll send me the
data if we need it.

Latest Tino-gram:  Apparently high power prices at 4 Corners have DOE excited 
about the project all of a sudden.  The latest configuration is in the 
300-380 mw range.  Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested 
in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are 
basically tolling agreements--ENA would pay a monthly capacity reservation 
charge per KW of capacity and then pay actual fuel and variable cost for 
power that is actually dispatched)  $7/kw if the thing is simple cycle or 
$10/kw if combined cycle.  Variable cost would be $.005/kwh and fuel is 
whatever it is--ENA's problem.   I'm trying to get ahold of Tino to confirm, 
but I think these are prices at the plant, not FOB 4 Corners.  

Please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ENA 
guys.  Thanks.  DF

Allegheny Expands Growing Generation Portfolio with Solar Energy
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Allegheny Energy Solutions, an unregulated subsidiary of Allegheny Energy,
Inc., has added Siemens Solar Industries, L.P., to its growing portfolio
of suppliers for distributed generation products. Through its new agreement
with Siemens Solar Industries, Allegheny Energy Solutions will provide
its customers with a comprehensive offering of solar electric solutions
called earthsafe =01v. The systems are suited for industrial, commercial an=
d
residential applications. The new partnership further advances Allegheny's
strategy of becoming a national energy supplier.

ANALYSIS: This partnership comes on the heels of Allegheny's recently=20
announced
agreement to purchase three gas-fired merchant plants from Enron North
America. Both deals reaffirm Allegheny's intent to expand its geographic
footprint and strengthen the scope of its unregulated generation capability=
.
In my opinion, Allegheny is one of a handful of companies that have further=
ed
very aggressive generation expansion plans this year, announcing one=20
acquisition
or development after another. The company has added seven new offices in
the northeastern United States over the last year, and has disclosed that
it will open new offices in the Southeast in 2001 to begin preparing for
the albeit slow move to competition in that region.

The partnership with Siemens is particularly interesting as it indicates
that Allegheny believes solar power will become a significant part of its
service offerings. Siemens Solar is one competitive business in Siemens'
portfolio of companies, specializing in high and medium voltage, protection
and substation control systems, power and distribution transformers, system
planning, and decentralized energy supply systems.  Siemens Solar claims
to be the number one provider of solar-power solutions in the world, having
shipped solar cells and modules with a cumulative peak power of 200 MW.
The company has been in business for about 20 years, and reached a mileston=
e
of 100 MW in 1996. Thus, the company has doubled its production output
in just four years.

Siemens Solar offers an array of solar-related products. As noted, Alleghen=
y
Energy Solutions will be adopting Siemen's earthsafe platform which, accord=
ing
to information on Siemen's Website, is offered in four models ranging in
DC power from 300 watts to 1,200 watts. The earthsafe system consists of
solar modules, universal roof mounting kits, DC/AC inverters, and interconn=
ect
hardware. The intent is that businesses and residences would install the
earthsafe system to supply a portion of their energy needs (the remainder
supplied by more traditional means) and contribute to the efforts of reduci=
ng
emissions from fossil fuel plants. Allegheny Energy Solutions claims that
the addition of the Siemens' product to its service offerings positions
it as one of the only suppliers of distributed generation products to offer
a complete on-site power solution.

I think that this is a smart move for Allegheny to take as it certainly
diversifies the company's service offerings. Although the jury is still
out regarding the profitability of solar power, along with other forms
of distributed and renewable energy sources, for Allegheny the move makes
sense as it attempts to offer on a national scale a full package of energy
solutions. Allegheny Energy Supply, where most of the generation expansion
efforts of its parent are focused, develops competitive generation solution=
s
(e.g., cogeneration, green power, etc.) for a variety of end users. Within
the last year, Allegheny Energy Solutions has made great strides in moving
from a regional player into a national energy supplier, resulting primarily
from its success in the strong Northeast market.

This venture into solar continues a decided focus on distributed generation
on the part of the unregulated company. Earlier this year, Allegheny Energy
Solutions formed a partnership with Capstone Turbine Corporation under
which the Capstone MicroTurbine was installed at Allegheny Energy's Mitchel=
l
Power Station in New Eagle, Pa. Allegheny Energy Solutions is providing
technical and economic analysis of the unit for the customers of its parent
company. This was a very strategic partnership for Allegheny as it makes
the company one of the few system integrators of the Capstone MicroTurbine
in the Northeast.

The diversification of Allegheny's generation arsenal is also important
because it gives the company a possible edge over direct competitors.=20
Allegheny
must surely know that companies like Dominion, Reliant and AES=01*just to
name a few=01*are also aggressively stacking up generation assets in key ar=
eas
across the country. Thus, by adding diverse power options to its service
offerings, Allegheny conceivably will have more to offer customers in its
energy supply packages. I observed several months ago that Allegheny was
probably in search of a unique niche to set itself apart from other compani=
es
that are strong in generation. This partnership with Siemens seems to indic=
ate
that distributed generation, including solar power, could become that niche=
.

As a sidenote, Allegheny Energy was just added to Standard & Poor's 500
Index earlier this week. So, the announcement that the company is diversify=
ing
into solar power comes at a time when, as CEO Alan Noia puts it, "our stron=
g
growth strategy and resulting solid financial performance" have received
recognition. The S&P 500 Index is widely regarded as the standard for=20
measuring
large-capitalization U.S. stock market performance. As of yesterday (Dec.
7), Allegheny Energy's stock (NYSE: AYE) was priced at $42 5/16.

The only red flag that I can determine for this deal relates to Siemens,
not Allegheny Energy Solutions. Competition among companies that develop
products related to solar power has become pretty fierce as of late, and
there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the profitability
of this market. One direct competitor to Siemens that I've tracked recently
is Evergreen Solar, a company whose String Ribbon technology reportedly
cuts in half the required use of silicon, which is needed for most solar-po=
wer
technologies. Evergreen Solar, which recently became a publicly traded
company, has acknowledged that its own market prospects are uncertain and
that it may never become a profitable company.

The same market conditions apply to Siemens Solar Industries, so the compan=
y
may have a difficult time in finding wide application for its solar power
units. This is, of course, an issue for Siemens, and not Allegheny, to
address. Under its partnership with Siemens, Allegheny attains all the
value of solar power technologies and little of the risks. Thus, this appea=
rs
to be a smart venture for Allegheny and one that should strongly benefit
its power supply opportunities.

Subject: Price Gouging

Drew, I will try to summarize the research I did today on the referenced 
subject.  The bottom line is that I did not find any California statutes that 
appeare to be applicable to what we're doing.  I looked at California's 
General Business Regulations, Unfair Trade Practices statute, the Public 
Utilities Code, an ALR annotation that discussed cases in which courts have 
reviewed acts or practices prohibited by state deceptive trade practice and 
consumer protection statutes, and I searched case law and statutes using 
terms such as gouging, unconscionable, pricing practices, etc.  The 
California Unfair Practices Act is "... not a price-fixing statute, but seeks 
to regulate conduct of those engaged in business in order to eliminate such 
unfair practices as price discrimination indulged in for purpose of injuring 
competitors or destroying competition.  It does not make every difference in 
price unlawful, but only those differences that cannot be justified after 
proper allowance has been made for differences in grade, quality, quantity or 
cost of transportation."   It appears that the statutes and cases that are 
anywhere close to what we're looking for deal with protection of the ultimate 
consumer and not sophisticated energy companies.  

I did find a price gouging statute in New York that states that its purpose 
is to prohibit conduct that could occur during periods of abnormal disruption 
of the market caused by strikes, power failures, severe shortages or other 
extraordinary adverse circumstances when parties have taken unfair advangage 
of consumers by charging grossly excessive prices for essential goods and 
services.  I reviewed two cases, People v. Two Wheel Corp. and State of New 
York v. Strong Oil Company, that deal with a company that sold portable 
electric generators at unconscionably excessive prices during a power failure 
caused by a hurricane and a company that sold home heating fuel at an 
unconscionably excessive price during a period of abnormal disruption of the 
market, respectively.  (The Strong Oil case discussed Federal pre-emption of 
state law due to the Federal Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act.)  I will put 
copies of these cases as well as some of the other documents mentioned above 
in your in-box in case you want to review them.  

I looked briefly at Texas law but didn't see anything.  I obviously didn't 
get every state covered.  If you want me to look further, please let me 
know.

In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial 
team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas 
under the tariff ought to be interpreted.  Here is my list.  Please add items 
if I've missed any.

1.  When can TW "selectively market" available capacity?   I.e., if capacity 
is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits 
on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal?  I 
think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to 
talk to one customer is always "selective" since there's only one guy on the 
phone, not all our customers.  Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off 
the list of "the usual suspects" we call to pitch a special deal like an 
index to index deal or a discount?  I've asked Lee to pull together a quick 
analysis of this issue.  

2.  If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open 
season context, how do we allocate it?  This is the situation we got into a 
couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space.  Are we always required to use 
a lottery?  Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use 
pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance?

3.  What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate 
contracts?  The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW 
discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore).  I think all neg. rate 
deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max 
rate strd language deals.    
4.  ???  I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.  

Thanks for your input on this.  DF

On Friday, November 3,  at 4:30, we will be migrating the ETS QuickPlace 
server.   The maintenance is expected to last approximately 30 minutes

What does this mean to you?

Users who access the IdeaBank or any QuickPlace discussion sites, i.e.  ETS 
Infrastructure, Program Office, ETS Standards will not be able to access them 
until the server has been brought back up.

The IdeaBank will automatically be rerouted to the new server.  However, any 
references to GTHOU-WW01P/QuickPlace  will need to be changed to 
NAHOU-LNWW01/QuickPlace.
 
If you have any concerns about this maintenance, please contact the Customer 
Assistance Center at 713-345-4745

Per our discussion, I've modified the letter to remove reference to the 
monthly pack agreement and made a couple of other minor changes.  I wasn't 
able to get ahold of Bill on Friday afternoon to discuss who will sign, so 
for now I've left it with signature blocks for Bill and Rod only.  I hope we

Electronic Filings/Demo of FERC home page and search functions might be a 
good topic for one of our staff meetings.  Nancy Bagot could present in 
person or via Video Conference.   Also, I gathered the Koch and Dominion 
materials regarding standards of conduct in electric proceedings.   I'd be 
happy to present but I also thought Tony would be a good choice as it would 
help him get up to speed on the Marketing Affiliate Rule.  Let's discuss.

Subject: IT news from FERC

On Friday I attended an industry luncheon with Fernanda Young, FERC's Chief 
Information Officer.  She discussed some of the electronic filing and 
research changes coming to FERC.  The crux of the discussion is that within a 
few years (by 2003), FERC's internet website will include a searchable 
database that functions very much like Lexus/Nexus (except for the exorbitant 
fees).

For electronic filing, the first step begins tomorrow with comments (without 
service lists) being filed electronically.  Filers do not have to duplicate 
with a paper copy.  All filings, which can be received by FERC in almost any 
format, will be converted to Adobe Acrobat (.pdf files) by FERC for viewing 
online and available within minutes of being received.   The electronic PDF 
version will be the official copy for pagination citations.  The next round 
of filings to be accepted electronically will include interventions and 
protests.  Coming on line further down the road are documents with extensive 
service lists, as Fernanda is intent on cleaning up those lists of duplicate 
or "stale" names, companies and parties before going forward with electronic 
service of parties.  That process could be very involved, since each party 
will have to be contacted with a chance to respond before being removed or 
changed from a service list.

Another sticking point with major filings is the issue of electronic 
signatures, which is a security issue rather than a legal issue.  Electronic 
signatures demand the highest level of security and will be very costly to 
implement.  Fernanda believes that encryption offers sufficient security and 
she will urge the Commission to make an initial recommendation that does not 
include electronic filing.  This will be discussed with industry through a 
series of informal outreach sessions over the next few months; Fernanda 
expects some pushback on electronic signatures from some industry members, 
especially attorneys and law firms.

As for internet access and research capabilities, the FERC homepage will be 
revamped to include better design and more accessible information for 
non-FERC watchers (ie, the general public).  RIMS and CIPS will eventually be 
combined into one database that will be searchable (by words contained in a 
document's Abstract) and easy to use for researching and printing documents.  
All documents will be in PDF format.  The timeline for these changes is 
relatively short, with the full transition of the database and electronic 
filing requirements completed by 2003.

Good thinking and good hustle on your part Craig, as usual.  Do we know what 
the system problems were and if they were on their end or ours?  I agree that 
timetable issues in general and the approval process for Demarc deals, in 
particular, need to be reviewed when we get together on contract process 
issues.

Subject: Re: Routing request on EOL deal


This is a long story...

Oneok requested a deal for Feb. 3-28, 10,000/d from MidCon Pool to Demarc @ 
$.03/d Demand + Min. Commodity (Standard Language terms plus all Field Area 
points available as alternates at the discounted rate).  Originally, this 
deal was going to be entered into via EOL.  I input the deal's terms into CMS 
(contract system) under this assumption.  Oneok was a first-time EOL 
participant and they had system problems when attempting to accept the EOL 
posting.  With the "on-time" nom deadline fast approaching, I decided to 
switch the deal over to a standard TFX agreement.  Since EOL deals are 
"pre-approved,"  the deal had already been  manually routed (at my request) 
so it could be activated per our standard EOL process.  This deal was 
required to route due to the Demarc DP (all other terms were standard and 
within the Marketer's approval level).  At the point I decided to switch the 
deal over to a TFX deal from an EOL deal, it was impossible to re-route for 
approval .  I advised Danny and Drew of the change and they signed off on the 
CAF form.  I then called Ranelle and advised her of the switch from EOL to 
TFX but she was not given time to review the agreement.  The deal was then 
faxed to the Shipper, signed, returned, activated and nominated prior to 
11:30am.  The deal got done but not within our standard procedures.   The 
window between a deal being struck and on time noms (a factor in the deal's 
value) is constantly shrinking, leaving no room for error.   Hopefully the 
Contract Process meeting scheduled for next week will address some of these 
issues.  If anyone has additional questions, I'll try and answer them.

There was an EOL deal this morning for Oneok Field Services, req 39940, for 
10,000; Midcontinent Pool to Demarc that because of demarc, requires 
approvals through President level.

Due to the nature of the EOL deals, I routed the request then approved on 
your behalf immediately thereafter.

Please disregard your email notice to approve request 39940.  Should you have 
further questions, please advise.

I don't think having an intrastate in the ETS family would be a problem.  We 
could even run it with a merchant business if we firewalled the merchant 
entity off from the ETS pipelines.  Keep me in the loop and get MKM's group 
in at the appropriate time (far enough in advance of us submitting a bid that 
they can opine on the valuation).  Thanks. df

Here is a transmittal from Conoco on the PowerTex deal.  They suggest we 
schedule our data room visit for Friday Jan 26.  Please let me know if THIS 
DATE WORKS FOR YOU?  Seems like one day in the data room should be sufficient 
given that our interest is limited to only the PowerTex system. 

Before going to the data room, there are several issues we ought to think 
through.  Here are some of them, ... you can probably add others.

Assuming we leave it standalone, PowerTex would be the only intrastate 
pipeline in the ETS family ... is that a problem? 
ETS can not buy/sell gas, so can the PowerTex business be structured as 
transport only (or do we need to bring in a marketer or other player?)
What are the growth opportunities (access to new customers, inexpensive 
increases in capacity, etc.)
What are major risks going forward (losing customers to competition, contract 
expiration, reduced contractual transport rates, etc.)
Any environmental/litigation exposure
Structure of transaction (taxes, liabilities, indemnifications, etc.)   
Others?

Steve is now in Omaha, but when he returns let's get together as a group.

I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
Policy. 

Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.

Hey I'm watching your fair city on the tube--I suppose you are at the NCAA 
final.  I'm stuck down here in Houston again--been down here at least 3 days 
every week for a month.  Sandra digs it--at least I'm out of her face.  She 
was down here last week with me for 3 days looking at schools and houses with 
the 3 girls.  That car was full of bitching, whining and crying.  And the 
kids got a little cranky too.  Gonna come and visit us???  We'll probably 
move in August--bring your dad's pickup and you can help!  What a great time 
to move when its 200 degrees and the fire ants and poisonous lizards are in 
full frenzy.  Ugh.  We've gotta hook up with you guys before then.  We're out 
for Easter week, but we'll need a quick road trip eventually.  It would also 
be cool if you guys want to come down--Omaha would seem like Cancun after the 
winter you've had!  Take care dude. DF

Subject: Draft GPG Presentation for Sept. 19 Conference


Attached is a draft set of slides and notes for Dave Neubauer's remarks at 
the Sept. 19 FERC Technical conference.  The presentation is built around 
Dave's outline of the six elements of making pipeline capacity "tradeable" 
that he described at the last regulatory roundtable. {Look at powerpoint 
presentation in notes view to see the text}

As you'll see, we are not  advocating for specific regulatory changes in the 
presentation.   Our message is that the Commission does not need to force 
segmentation and one-size-fits-all policies to make capacity trading a 
reality.   Rather,  some minor adjustments, together with growing industry 
acceptance of capacity trading are all that is necessary to make it happen.




Dave's Other Panelists:
Altra will also be on Dave' panel and will talk about trading (most likely 
why their exchange model is superior to EOL). 
Jeff Holligan of Amoco will likely speak about the need for forced pipeline 
capacity auctions as a means to eliminate marketing affiliate concerns and 
the need for standardization to promote liquidity.  
Diane McViker of Salt River Project will talk about why pipelines should be 
willing to keep supplier records for shippers as part of the recent GISB 
cross-contract ranking 
Robert Levin of NY Mercantile Exchange will talk about factors that improve 
liquidity and whether gas markets are liquid today.
Jon Wilems of the Wisc. Distributor group will also speak about greater 
commodization of capacity to develop trading of capacity.

Senate Calls for Hearing into High Gas Prices

There appears to be one issue that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill 
can agree on --- gas prices are too high. Chairman Frank H. Murkowski (R-AK) 
of the Senate Energy Committee and Ranking Minority Member Jeff Bingaman 
(D-NM) have called for an oversight hearing to look into rising natural gas 
prices. 

The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 12 in Senate Dirksen 366. 
Appearing before the committee will be representatives of the gas industry 
and the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. 

"Spot prices for natural gas on Dec. 6 hit $9.54/MMBtu. That compares to a 
price a year ago of about $2.16/Btu," said Murkowski. "We are concerned about 
both price and availability of supply as we move into the winter months."

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

John, great to hear that you are still doing the Lord's work on this case!  
Sounds like you have things well in hand and that the appeal argument went 
well.  Good luck on this one and please let me know how it turns out--in 
fact, please send me a copy of the appellate decision when issued at this 
email address or by mail at 1111 S. 103d St. Omaha Nebraska, 68124.  Thanks.

Subject: MHP-Bath 2d Cir Argument


We argued the Bath appeal in the Second Circuit last Friday.  Bath's
counsel went first for 10 minutes; I was second for 8 minutes; Alan Knauf
was next for CREST for 2 minutes; David Connors took 2 minutes for TPC; and
Bath's counsel took the final 2 minutes for rebuttal.  The panel took the
matter under advisement when the argument was finished.

The panel was Judge Jacobs (who was on the recent Primetime 24 Joint
Venture case dealing with the "access barring" sham exception to Noerr-
Pennington), Judge Straub and Judge Sacks.  All three are from private
practice with large firms.

The argument went reasonably well, although the panel played it pretty
close to the vest.  Bath's counsel was not brilliant and received a lot of
hard questions from the bench.  The panel seemed to have no trouble with
the fact that the District Court reviewed the administrative record in
addition to the allegations in Bath's complaint.  They got close to getting
a concession from Bath's counsel that the complaint alleges damages from
long delays in the administrative process, which necessarily puts at issue
the overall course of the agency proceedings and requires the judge to
review the record.

The panel also seemed uninterested in Bath's argument that Noerr-Pennington
immunity only applies to antitrust cases.  The panel recognized that the
First Amendment protections must apply to all types of causes of action.

The biggest issue for the panel appeared to be the "fraud" sham exception
to Noerr-Pennington.  During argument, Bath's counsel suggested that, if
only he had discovery, he would be able to prove that MHP's experts had
"doctored" the geological data as part of submitting their fraudulent
affidavits.  I countered that this was the first we had ever heard of such
allegations, that they were never part of Bath's complaint, and that the
only allegation was that the expert's "opinions" were wrong and without
basis.

The court came back to the question of what to do if a party claims that
there has been clear fraud committed during the agency proceeding.  I
argued, and Judge Straub agreed, that such fraud is only relevant under the
case law if it goes to the very core of the proceeding and deprives it of
its legitimacy.  The district court's opinion establishes that noting like
that occurred here.

Finally, both I and David Connors argued that the lower court's alternative
proximate cause ruling was independently fatal to Bath's complaint, in that
the alleged "fraud", even if it had occurred, did not cause any of Bath's
alleged damages.

Please call me (202-719-7038) if you would like further details regarding
the argument.  Otherwise, we will just have to wait for the decision.

This weekend on Tony Dean's Outdoors (the guy from Pierre) they featured a 
farm near Kennebec.? It is just South of where we were last year.? They 
appear a bit more organized with dogs and real guides.? I thought you might 
like their site.? I would guess that they are way more expensive than our 
guy, reinforcing our sense that we got a good deal.

I agree with your concern but I've gotten comfortable that the pleading does 
a good job of finessing the issue.  Technically, you are right and PNM's 
service is neither "firm" or "interruptible."  It is my understanding that 
PNM  assigns priority based on a number of factors including whether the 
customer is a core customer or not, et cet.  I think that PNM is capable of 
determining on a contract by contract basis whether the capacity will be 
firm, even though the rate schedule may not say "firm."   Explaining all that 
complexity would make it unlikely that FERC would approve the rehearing.  
Nevertheless, I believe its accurate to say that we will only repackage as 
firm service the capacity that we buy from PNM and that they tell us is 
"firm."  I think the draft does that, without going throught the unhelpful 
detail on how PNM handles its own priority system.  If I misunderstand the 
facts or if anyone disagrees with this approach, lets talk about it.  DF

Subject: Re: RP00-249 Rehearing Request  

I have a concern with this overall argument about firm and interrupitble as 
we stated we would only buy firm service from PNM, but moreso, when we looked 
at the detail of the PNM service when preparing for the technical conference, 
it is only best efforts-  does this argument fit?  and can we really buy firm 
service from them??  MK

I agree with Danny's email that the key timetable issue for the incremental 
10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the 
15,000hp motor.  It was my understanding that the long lead time items were 
going to be ordered shortly (if they haven't been already) and that we'd take 
the financial risk.  If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals won't 
be the critical path item they usually are.  I've reviewed the FERC 
application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a request 
for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would expedite 
things.  Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would allow us to 
avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San Juan lateral.  
If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan, the additional 
horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional flexibility or additional 
capacity.   I'll talk to Steve today to make sure we are doing everything 
possible to expedite these efforts.  DF

I believe that Phil Lowry is looking at ways to get some additional capacity 
out of the system as well.  We want to expedite these efforts too..  I would 
like to see an application filed filed by January 31st to get 30 to 50 
MMCF/D. 

Steve Harris and Phil Lowry should have the lead to get this done.  I am 
willing to construct at risk but want to see the financials as well.

I have been having trouble with my email, but it's back on line.? Have  you 
gotten my phone messages regarding the meeting with Murray Fogler?? It  went 
well, and he has?agreed that if we can't find an easy solution to the  
issues, he will support me in court on the motion to transfer the case to  
Houston.? At my suggestion, he will also ask Duke about the possibility  
of?their participation in a quick mediation or binding arbitration, and  will 
make contact (he says he has had none up to now) with counsel for Chisos to  
take their temperature on these and all other issues.
?
In the meantime, he will (at his own prompting) consider the last paragraph  
of my original letter as our settlement offer and come back with an 
"official"  response.? I will let you know as soon as?I hear something.

N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin

Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to 
Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 
325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the 
rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold 
between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. 

The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the 
industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate 
plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's 
project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin 
for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 
2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. 

Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston 
Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. 

The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with 
direct access to several local distribution companies, including 
Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, 
People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, 
NGPL, Northern and Vector. 

The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year 
demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering 
"mileage-sensitive rates," which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor 
supply access and optimize transportation value. 

Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14. 
For more information, contact project director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at 
(402) 398-7758 or James Hoff in Denver at (303) 575-6475, or see the 
pipeline's Web site at www.northernborderpartners.com.

Three to-dos on our Mavrix meeting:
1.  Follow up and make sure the officers get set up correctly.
2.  Talk to Perry Frazier in planning--he is keeping copies of the actual EBB 
postings showing that we have had the Ignacio-Thoreau piece of capacity 
posted (the 33,000/d).  I'd like you to keep copies of those postings in your 
file until Mavrix actually buys that capacity.  If we end up in a fight at 
some time, we'll be able to prove the postings were out there, because the 
actual postings are not electronically archived, I am told.
3. All Mavrix deals will need initials from legal--probably you, Susan.  For 
now, please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes.  For 
Enron pipes, of course, contract approval will be via our ordinary procedures 
and MKM's group and I should be advised as a matter of course.  

Thanks.  DF

If we need to cashout for operational reasons then $500,993.10 is a fair 
price.

If we need the gas then they should pay the value of the gas which is 
estimated at $728,274.40.

So the answer is 
If we want the cashout get at least $500,993.
If they want the cashout and we need gas get $728,274.

Subject: PROS piece in Gas Daily


PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Lee:

Since we spoke last night I have talked to Ted.  We all come out the same
way, I think, that this episode is probably best left alone.

First, unless Kim has information to the contrary, I think we would have a
hard time establishing that the only way the alleged "failed" Enron system
became known to PROS was via the PROS/ET&S relationship.  If it could have
become known independently via a source not protected by a nondisclosure
agreement, then we have no real complaint.

Second, if the statement in the Gas Daily is actually true, then we have no
axe to grind about defamation or related issues.

It is unfortunate that a casual reader might think that the statement
actually refers to a failure in the PROS/ET&S RM work rather than to a
failure in the prior Enron capacity management project.  Perhaps we are more
sensitive than most, however, knowing what we know.  I would guess that
there are probably a lot of readers out there who are unaware of the ET&S RM
project and thus would not know to mistakenly attribute the statement to the
ET&S RM project.

Further, the mistake that a casual reader might make might also be
attributable to sloppy journalism as much to what McCracken at PROS may have
actually said.

Finally, the longer we do not hear from PROS, the more their "case" weakens
in the future complaining about the genealogy of our RM product.

In summary, probably best left alone.  But I do recommend that we continue
to monitor for this stuff.  It appears the PROS RM products are now
available and we can only guess what Enron information is inside them to
make them work, or was used to sell them or make them work.

What would we have to do to get rid of the Demarc deal approval requirement 
(requiring President level approval for all Demarc delivery deals)? Can Danny 
revoke the policy, just like Bill created it?  DF

As long as Dave and/or you are signing off on the EOL packages, I don't have 
any problem with this.  As to non-EOL deals, we may also want to eliminate 
the requirement that all Demarc deals need such a high approval level.  I 
don't think there is anything uniquely risky about Demarc as long as we have 
our capacity posting squared away.  DF

Tenaska Marketing Ventures accepted a package on EOL yesterday that delivers 
to demarc.  Although EOL deals are pre-approved the CMS system is coded to 
route demarc deals to the president level.  In order to expedite the 
activation of this request and since it was a pre-approved EOL deal, I 
approved the route for each of you in CMS per a request from marketing.  

Please let me know if this process will not be agreeable on future EOL deals 
that include demarc.

Thanks

Linda

Subject: Capacity Options on TW

Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the 
comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our 
discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and 
the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will 
probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in 
the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The 
letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to 
the agreement.

I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is 
important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well 
as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to 
coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date.

Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change 
based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the 
loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in 
order to get the information you need.

Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached 
before next Wednesday if possible.  

Thank you.

As we're beginning to see the second wave of Order 637 proceeding technical 
conferences being scheduled, here is a brief update on the proposed 
timetables for the first few dockets.  As December kicks off, we are in a 
settlement mode in all the cases, with most pipelines in informal discussions 
with customers/parties to work towards consensus settlements that can be 
filed with the Commission.  

** Note that Koch, adamant that segmentation is not operationally feasible on 
its system, has circulated a settlement proposal on segmentation.  See below.


ANR, RP00-332: 

 After three technical conferences at FERC, ANR is committed to developing a 
total consensus document.  ANR is circulating their latest revisions to 
customers by December 7th, and customers are meeting without the Commission 
or the pipeline to discuss ANR's proposal on December 15th.  A follow-up 
technical conference at FERC is scheduled for January 11, 2001.


Dominion, RP00-344:

Dominion has held at least five meetings with customers to work out a 
settlement in this case.  A technical conference, originally scheduled for 
late October, has been rescheduled with FERC Staff for December 14th.  This 
should be a meeting on a settlement proposal.


Koch, RP00-340:

Koch has circulated revisions to its Order 637 filing, including a settlement 
proposal for segmentation.  There will be a conference call among Koch and 
its customers on December 5th to get comments on the tariff revisions as 
discussed at the October 25th technical conference and the new segmentation 
proposal.  After that call, a follow-up technical conference at FERC should 
be scheduled for sometime in January.

[The segmentation proposal would allow customers broader supplemental rights 
in the zones in which their primary receipt and primary delivery points are 
located.  When points are located in different zones, the customer would be 
entitled to utilize its full MDQ in each zone (in essence doubling their 
MDQ).   It's critical to Koch's offer that all segmented transactions will be 
scheduled on a supplemental basis, as this is the only protection for the 
operational integrity of its system and primary firm services of other 
customers.  The right to segmentation can be waived by customers and it will 
be available on a prospective basis only for new or renegotiated contracts.  
Koch is also proposing a "segmentation fee" to be assessed either to those 
customers utilizing segmentation or by all Koch customers (undecided in the 
proposal).  This fee will be used to recover all costs associated with 
developing the segmentation program and necessary computer system.]


Colorado Interstate, RP00-325:

CIG will circulate revisions by December 1st to its compliance filing as 
discussed at the pipeline's second technical conference on October 26th.  
Parties will send comments to CIG by December 10th.  The schedule, from that 
point, will go into January.  CIG may follow Dominion's lead and schedule 
settlement meetings with parties before meeting with Staff again.


Tennessee, RP00-477:

Tennessee is circulating revisions based on discussions at the November 14th 
technical conference by December 8th.  Parties will meet within two weeks of 
that date to discuss the revisions (either separately or at a FERC technical 
conference).


Kinder Morgan, RP00-343:

Kinder Morgan plans to circulate a revised 637 package by December 15th, with 
a conference call scheduled for January 4th to get feedback from customers on 
the revisions.  The pipeline believes there may not be a need for a second 
technical conference and hopes to file a settlement and implementation plan 
by the end of January.

I'm ok with the change.  Just curious, but Courtney doesn't get any  time 
value of money recognition on his prepayment?  Also, the prepayment gives us 
a cash, but not earnings, benefit, right?  Thanks.  DF

An overview of NERC's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009
      ,Copyright 2000 EEI. All rights reserved.

EEI's State Restructuring Service is proud to present an Internet E-Forum 
providing an overview of the North American Electric Reliability Council's 
(NERC) recently released Reliability Assessment 2000-2009, the reliability of 
bulk electric systems in North America.

The reliability of the electric generation and transmission systems serving 
North America has come under increased federal government, state regulator, 
and customer scrutiny. Generation capacity margins have decreased and the 
bulk electric systems are subjected to flows in magnitudes and directions not 
contemplated when they were designed or for which there is minimal operating 
experience.

Each year, the Reliability Assessment Subcommittee (RAS) of the North 
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reviews the overall reliability 
of existing and planned electric generation and transmission systems in North 
America. This year's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009 report presents:

*An assessment of electric generation and transmission reliability through 
2009

*An assessment of the generation resource adequacy of each Interconnection in 
North America

*A discussion of key issues affecting reliability of future electric supply

*Regional assessments of electric supply reliability, including issues of 
specific Regional concern

Presenting an overview of this year's Reliability Assessment is Frank J. 
Koza, Jr., Chairman, Reliability Assessment Subcommittee, and General 
Manager, Ventures, PECO Energy Company.

Our guest moderator is Tim Gallagher, Mgr Technical Services, NERC

To provide questions and commentary we have Jolly Hayden, Vice President of 
Transmission, Dynegy

A copy of the Reliability Assessment 2000-2009 is available from the NERC web 
site at http://www.nerc.com/~pc/syscond.html.

November 21, 2000 1 p.m. ET
Note: Please block a 2-hour time slot for the E-Forum. We expect the program 
to take about one hour. Q&A at the conclusion of the E-Forum could take up to 
an additional hour.

The Supreme Court has ruled that there cannot be a nativity scene in
Washington, D.C. this Christmas.

This isn't for any religious reason.  They simply have not been able to
find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol.

There was no problem however finding enough asses to fill the stable.




Happy Holidays,

Subject: Proposal to Caithness Big Sandy

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Hey, great talking to you.  I appreciate your willingness to talk to David 
about the DOE situation.  He's a great guy and one of the best substantive 
lawyers I've met.  Short bio--U. of Missouri undergrad, Northwestern law 
school.  He was a staffer after law school on the House or Senate Ag 
committee--I can't remember which.  Big time federalist society member and 
knows all those ultra-right winger types.  He was my partner at Wiley Rein 
and Fielding and was the right hand man of Dick Wiley and Fred Fielding among 
the younger partners--kind of an enforcer, future executive committee type 
(he kept me from getting fired a couple of times--I'm sure he regrets that 
now).  Dave wasn't an energy lawyer originally, but did a lot of work on my 
client stuff and took over my natural gas clients after I left Wiley.  He 
also did a lot of electric restructuring stuff (he was one of the lead 
lawyers for Penn. Power and Light and United Illuminating on the Order 888 
compliance filings and Nepool and PJM Power Pool open access 
restructurings).   He's a Missouri native and got tired of the DC law firm 
rat race and moved to KC.  Currently a partner at Blackwell Sanders Peper 
Martin--does a lot of Utilicorp/Aquila stuff as you'd expect.  Dave's direct 
dial at work is 816-983-8385 and his home number is 816-407-9026.  

Mark--anything you can do to give this guy a sense of what life is like at 
DOE would be great.  I'm not sure how seriously Dave is being considered for 
the DOE Dep. GC spot, but I know that Fred Fielding and Dick Wiley have done 
some pushing on his behalf.  It may be that a call from you to someone out 
there might put him over the hump.  I'll leave that for you and he to 
discuss.  Thanks and good luck with your various adventures!  df

I also checked with my buddy about why the value of Pale Verde value tails 
off in the out years.   He says it is because a large part of there power 
supply is generated by hydro plants and part of the spike this year was 
created by the lack of moisture this past winter.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT, JOINT DEFENSE PRIVILEGE

Dear Larry and Merlin,

 This will confirm our various telephone conversations about the 
above-referenced case.  Again, it is my understanding that we have all agreed 
(me on behalf of Northern/Transwestern, Larry on behalf of Duke, and Merlin 
on behalf of CMS Energy/Panhandle Eastern) to jointly retain Jim Peters to 
represent our respective interests in responding to the defendants' subpoenas 
and recently-filed motion to compel, which I have been advised is set for 
telephonic hearing on Monday, August 14, at 8:00 a.m.  Per this agreement, we 
will share Jim's fees and expenses on a 1/3 Northern/Transwestern, 1/3 Duke, 
1/3 CMS Energy/Panhandle Eastern basis.  As part of this agreement, each of 
us agrees to handle substantially all of his respective client's actual 
document production in-house, in order to hold Jim's fees and expenses down.

 In the very unlikely event that Jim encounters an unanticipated conflict 
between the positions of our respective clients, you additionally agree that 
Jim may withdraw from the representation of your clients in this matter, but 
may continue to represent Northern and Transwestern in this matter.

 Jim is currently working on a draft response to defendants' motion to compel 
for Northern/Transwestern.  By copy of this, I am asking Jim to send each of 
you drafts at the same time that he sends a draft by me.

 I look forward to working with you both.

     Regards,

     Britt Davis

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

If that's all we need commercially, I'm fine with it.  I'd be more 
enthusiastic if we thought that their removal of the protest would clear up 
all FERC's issues and result in cancellation of the tech. conf. and prompt 
approval of the filing, but I suspect that is too much to ask for.  DF

Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably 
(i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would 
amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can 
acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from 
becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never 
been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether 
this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same 
concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our 
proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.

Subject: iBuyit Program

To All -

Just a follow-up message to each of you about the iBuyit program.  

I am still in need of a designated volunteer from each of your groups to act 
as a Change Agent for this program.  Since it is a Corp. initiative and will 
be implemented over time, I need to make sure all areas of the Legal Dept. 
are on board.  

Please provide me with the name of at least one person within your group who 
fits the Change Agent bill.  For those that have forgotten, the Change Agent 
is defined as follows:

"individuals who are highly respected within their area and known as the 'GO 
TO' people among their peers."

Their responsibilities are:

- to disseminate communications regarding the project
- to develop awareness and ownership of the product among their department
- to encourage use of the product
- identify those who will need training
- encourage peer training attendance 
- engage in rumor control (basically relay the facts of the program and not 
the myths (e.g., the product will replace jobs))

Information needs to be distributed to these individuals as soon as possible 
so that they can be prepared for demonstrations of the iBuyit product next 
week.

Thanks for your assistance.

If any of you have any questions, please let me know.

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering, but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF

Subject: Re: gouging  

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

Subject: Draft May 9 Project Why Presentation

FYI.  Attached is a copy of the Project Why status presentation that will be 
made next week at Stan's May 9 staff meeting.  The purpose of the 
presentation was to present a list of brainstorming ideas from an Apr. 16 
offsite session to GPG management & get some preliminary feedback on the 
kinds of ideas they would like to see proceed.  It was never meant to be a 
definitive plan for implementing those ideas.  I always envisioned the 
individual commercial groups picking up on which ideas they liked and wanted 
to implement & developing their own detailed plans for implementing.

Subject: Proposal to Caithness Big Sandy

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

I'm on a conf. call with Minnegasco from 8-10 Friday.  Please go forward 
without me and I'll circle back in later.  My view is that we need to look 
hard at a second expansion project, maybe jointly with Questar or someone 
else (Mojave?) that goes all the way to the market.  We may be semi-serious 
about the within-Cal. portion of the project, but it would be great potential 
leverage against the utilities and CPUC.  df

I'm OK with 8 o'clock, but the gang may have to put up with cell phone static 
and the occassional peeps out of my kids in the back seat (I'm off tomorrow 
and will be packing the kids up to head out about 7:45 a.m.).

Julie,
We had a great idea (but poor execution) to get together with Danny this 
morning.  Even though I'm going to be out on Friday, if Danny is available, 
could you block off about 30 minutes in the a.m. for Drew, Susan, Jeff 
Dasovich and myself to run an idea past him?  If Danny asks, let him know 
we're trying to weigh the merits of filing to build an expansion into the 
state of California.  Whether we ultimately build it or not isn't the issue 
as much as whether the threat of another pipeline could motivate the 
utilities and the CPUC to build additonal take-away capacity for TW 
shippers.  I think Steve Harris is out of town for the rest of the week.  If 
not, we'll certainly want to plug him in also.  Will you let me know in the 
a.m.?  Thanks.

I think we need to follow closely the Koch settlement conference concerning 
segmentation as it relates to their zones and their "segmentation fee". I 
have not been following this proceeding at all but feel we should watch 
closely.

Subject: Re: TW Capacity Options  

As I have mentioned already a couple of times, the Commercial Group feels it 
is important to have something to present to customers.  My concern is that 
if we just tell them about it over lunch or over the phone, something is 
going to be ignored or lost in the translation, and then we'll have a dozen 
protests to contend with.  Surely we've presented new services to customers 
before in advance of filing...if so, how did we go about it?

Also, are you OK with filing July 31, or just as soon as we can get a 
prefiling conference with FERC?

Subject: Re: TW Capacity Options  

I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even 
though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by 
not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many 
checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might 
be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are 
planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure 
everything is addressed before filing.

Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The 
marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review 
beginning TODAY.

Subject: Re: TW Capacity Options  

Susan, 

 In reviewing the proposed filing I had some questions.  On page 2 in the 
discussion of ensuring sufficient capacity we offer to establish position 
guidelines, do we need to outline these and either include them as an exhibit 
or have them ready for reply to either protesters or a staff data request?  
Secondly, if we regard this as a new service does our filing comply with all 
aspects of 154.202 (a) (ii), (iii), (iv) (A) & (B), (v), (vi), (viii) and 
(ix)?  In recent filings the staff has challenged our filings in terms of 
addressing each of these requirements.  I believe many our covered but 
thought you might like to double check for compliance.  What about a revenue 
estimate? Seems like we need one, even if its still very speculative.

Glen

Subject: USGT East - East Capacity deal  

Except for a small amount of capacity we're managing on a short-term basis 
[owing to the Topock lateral problem with PG&E], our West flow capacity is 
sold-out.  Therefore, there is really no means to compare the USGT alt. flow 
rights with an opportunity cost for unsubscribed firm capacity.  Moreover, 
the receipt points under the USGT deal are not on the San Juan Lateral, so 
any alt. West flow transportation will be marked against a Permian - Cal. 
Border price spread.  However, your instincts are probably correct regarding 
the practical use of the capacity -- if there is a market shift resulting is 
a significant widening of the East - West spread, then we'd likely see FTS-1 
shippers with primary rights more fully utilizing their firm capacity, 
thereby frustrating any USGT attempt to access Cal. Border capacity.

 Steve, Kevin, and Jeff: If what I heard this morning is correct and the San

Cal Border capacity with primary point rights at rates significantly higher 
than the $.04 available to USGT/Aquila under this deal.  In other words, it 
is very unlikely that USGT will be able to move significant volumes to 
California under the $.04 part of this deal, right?  With that understanding, 
I'm OK on the deal.  Thanks. DF

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the attached non-standard discount letter for USGT.  
Transwestern and USGT have agreed to enter into a contract for 400,000 Dth/d 
of primary EOT-EOT capacity for the term April 1, 2000 through October 31, 
2001.   The primary EOT-EOT path will be a 2-part rate structure:  $.0075 
reservation and $.0093 commodity rate. USGT will also have the ability to 
flow to California on an alternate basis at a $.04 total rate.    

Transwestern and USGT have agreed to enter into a Revenue Sharing Mechanism 
whereby after USGT recovers their contract demand charges plus an additional 
$2.5 Million in Commodity Sales Margin revenue,  then TW and USGT will share 
50%/50% in any additional Commodity Sales Margin revenue which USGT may 
receive.

USGT will not retain their ROFR rights for their contract.

(Please note that references to "Appendix A"  in the discount letter refer to 
the FTS-1 Appendix A primary receipt and delivery point allocation of the 
400,000 Dth/d primary capacity.)

Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
Approval.

There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the 
close of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial 
thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  

Q 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?  

A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were 
certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction 
is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an 
alternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements 
for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are 
executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it 
will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert. 
app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given 
the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to 
sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the 
capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a 
combination of both.  

Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options 
(to steal Jeff's term), like the following:
 1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or 
whatever number we decide on)
 2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges
 3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah
 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly 
this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and 
fuel retainage percentages)

A.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for 
1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve 
Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated 
rate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach 
could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking 
our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a 
7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would be 
a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can tell a 
customer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for 
the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options 
of our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this is 
sticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure.  

Q.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility do 
we have in structuring the options?  

A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose 
to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want to 
be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at 
$.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have 
discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we 
can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better 
deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we 
deliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by 
offering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and 
$.35 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to 
obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.            

Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???

A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it 
the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, 
Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d 
of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 
mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want 
option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That 
really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand 
first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else?  
Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be 
deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone may 
be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the 
recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the 
neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective 
nondiscriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh. 

Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answered 
already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are 
easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your 
convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get out 
and sell this stuff.  DF

Please Note:

We have changed the correlation of the Transwestern's hedges to the same 
index(El Paso Permian) that the derivatives were transacted.  We feel it is 
appropriate to make this correlation change due to management's anticipation 
to make the 2001 sales at an El Paso Permian index.  Due to this change TW 
has a perfect correlation, therefore the associated Value at Risk  will be 
zero.

Subject: New Matter/KN Transcolorado, Inc. v. Questar Corporation, et 
al/Third-party subpoenas

Mike and Andy,

Andy, I tried to send this message to Richard as well, but the computer 
directory is fouled up and won't let me do it.  I hope sending it to you is 
sufficient, but if not, let me know.

I received a call from Mike Noone of Mike Beatty & Associates about the 
above-referenced lawsuit, which is filed in state court in Garfield County, 
Colorado.  For Andy's reference, Beatty & Associates is representing the 
Enron entities and a number of other defendants in the Grynberg MDL case.  
This case is not a gas measurement case, which is the gist of the Grynberg 
action.

Noone's firm represents the plaintiff; I did not ask who represents the 
defendants, all of whom are Questar entities.  The lawsuit arises out of a 
partnerhip agreement to build the Transcolorado Pipeline.  The Transcolorado 
Pipeline takes gas from Colorado producers at its northern end to an 
interconnect (or interconnects) at its southern end to either El Paso or TW, 
who deliver the gas to California markets.  After it was built, Questar 
allegedly began building a competing pipeline, called the Main Line 104 
Project (the designation used in the FERC filings), which will connect 
Questar's gathering system at the northern end of the pipeline to the Kern 
River Pipeline.  Kern River will apparently ultimately deliver the gas to 
California markets.  KN contends that the Main Line 104 Project will take gas 
from exactly the same basins as the Transcolorado Pipeline (the Picence and 
Ulenta Basins, if I have that spelled correctly) and is in direct 
competition.  I did not ask Mike what relief KN is requesting.

KN is interested in documentation from TW and ENA that discusses what their 
competitive options are in getting gas from the area served by the 
Transcolorado Pipeline to California markets.  It appears that KN is hoping 
to see some discussion of the Main Line 104 Project as an alternative to the 
Transcolorado Pipeline.  It strikes me that such information may be highly 
sensitive.

I asked Mike why he thought ENA would have any such information, and Mike 
said that he thought ENA might own or have an interest in some producing 
properties in the relevant area.  I told Mike that that would be a surprise 
to me, and that EOG, which is the Enron entity that typically owns such 
interests, was spun off last year.  Mike said he would take another look to 
see why they thought ENA would have such information.

The trial date is one year out, and this is apparently the first round of 
discovery.  Mike would not be surprised if we got a call from Questar's 
attorneys, requesting the same information.

Noone faxed to me the proposed subpoenas, with the understanding that I was 
not authorized to accept service for them.  I will send copies to each of 
you.  Let me know if you would like the Unit to handle or assist in the 
handling of this.

Britt

For your information.  The outcome was great for TW because the Cal. PUC 
adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated 
restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.  The outcome is not 
so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement.  
The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of 
the competing settlements.  
I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have 
questions.

Subject: Bad Proposed Decision

Well, this shows the direction in which the "new" Commission is heading.  The 
very good news, though, is that  TW's proposal was included in both 
settlements (now that's hedging!).  Thus,  the benefits to TW were preserved 
under both proposals.  Congratulations.  That's fantastic--hard work that 
paid off.

We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point 
out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, 
when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.  

We should discuss.  Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it 
will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.

Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.   But we have a knack of 
making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here, 
whatever turns up at the end.

Best,
Jeff

The PD in the Gas Restructuring is out.   I have yet to read the whole
thing, but the title "Approval With Modifications Of The Interim
Settlement..." does not bode well.  According to Steve Watson (and I only
have Steve's statement second hand), the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market.

Just summarize the proposal again (briefly) and indicate the changes we 
agreed to make based on the technical conference and how we believe the 
initial filing, as modified to resolve the reasonable concerns raised by 
parties, ought to be approved.  I'd also add a short recount on the conoco 
and I. Shippers issues and indicate that vague, industry wide market 
affiliate issues are not appropriate in this docket and that the fact that 
some (not even all) producers have paranoid competitive concerns should not 
preclude shippers who would really benefit form these products from gaining 
access to them (i.e, summarize CalPine's very helpful comments).  df

Last saturday at Genie's service in Concordia, KS, I talked with Dave and, 
since he planned to spend most of this week in KC,  agreed to meet in KC for 
talk and lunch.  (He's in KC to support daughter Angie and to be there on 
friday when she goes in for an ultrasound.  Keep your fingers crossed - she 
prefers a girl.)
I went down yesterday morning and returned in the afternoon.  Really a swell, 
if not at times tough, day.  We met and chatted for about 2 hours at his 
hotel before going to pick up Angie for a 1 - 1 1/2 hour lunch - nice little 
Italian place, Cafe Italia  :)  :)
Obviously, the day was a roller coaster ride of emotions.  However, they both 
are doing well - Dave perhaps better than Angie - but both are fine.  At 
times, Dave was his usual "irreverent" self and we enjoyed many chuckles - 
love to listen to the guy go off.  At other times - perhaps we reminesced too 
deeply.
Dave's latest plans are to return to Houston on Saturday.  He mentioned to 
Angie at lunch that Dana and Robert have requested that he stay with them for 
awhile and he will do so.  Angie will follow Dave shortly to help him with 
matters in Houston.  I don't know when she will travel to Houston.
He also brought up the subject of a memorial service in Omaha.  He was 
struggling with his emotions - not wanting to hurt any feelings in Omaha but 
also wanting to get on with the healing process.  He (Angie agreed)  finally 
decided to forego a service in Omaha - relieved I'm sure.

There are also pressure obligations - a minimum delivery pressure of 600 psig 
and a maximum of 700 psig.   

otherwise, there are no volume restrictions...

Mike,

At your request I reviewed the June 27, 1995 Operating Agreement between PG&E 
and TW looking for any volume commitments and found only the following 
reference:

? 2.3  TW shall own, operate and maintain facilities. "...capable of 
delivering no less than 200,000 MMBtu of gas per day..." and PG&E facilities 
"...capable of receiving no less than 200,000 MMBtu per day...".

The Operating Agreement references an Interconnect Agreement between TW and 
PG&E dated 3/16/92.  It does not appear that the Operating Agreement canceled 
or superseded the Interconnect Agreement.  I am trying to find a copy of that 
Interconnect Agreement to see if any quantity language is in it.

Vig, do we have a certificate limit regarding the quantity we can deliver to 
PG&E at Topock?

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will

Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time 
(400-500 MMBtu/d 
hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to 
commission the
Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through.  
Some predictors 
are saying the delay may get longer.

Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November

Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will 
have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, 
because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the 
enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile 
project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. 

"Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has 
been removed from the line," says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. "However, periodic 
reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the 
required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux 
Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago." A spokesman said the 
debris included "bits of foam" that came off equipment used to extract 
moisture following hydrostatic testing. 

The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some 
observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline 
has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is 
designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of 
natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of 
pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline 
also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow 
the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control 
room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a 
physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the 
operation together around the clock 365 days a year. "It's a tremendously 
complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
all have to work together." 

Regardless of the delay, however, Alliance already is flowing a large amount 
of gas into the Chicago market. "At this point in our commissioning 
activities, the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50% of capacity. We 
expect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firm 
delivery capacity of 37.5 million cubic meters (1.325 Bcf) per day prior to 
the end of November."

Late yesterday, Steve Kean assembled a meeting of staff from across business 
units to discuss the legal and regulatory implications of current events in 
California.   Here are the notes I captured from the meeting.

Background:
The hard cap is still in place in Calif. electric market at this time 
(although the FERC has proposed moving to a soft cap under which prices above 
the cap would be allowed if cost justified).  As of yesterday, electricity is 
still flowing out of the state.   The governor has asked people to cut back 
on their electric usage, including Christmas lights.  With rolling brown-outs 
a possibility, there is a belief that people will go ahead an sell power at 
high prices above the hard cap, counting on the soft cap (i.e. regulators 
wanting generator to keep running at high-prices if that is what it takes to 
keep going).  But, this causes an interesting dilemma under which generators 
which have $5-6 gas are better off selling their gas, as only generators that 
can show a $27 gas price would be able to charge market electric rates.  
Parties with $5-6 gas are better off reselling the gas for another use.
Delivered gas at Cal. border is $26-27 ($33.75 today) for the remainder of 
the month, $19 for Jan. base load and $8 summer deliveries.
It was reported that SoCal gas has been buying $24 gas to fill up storage 
this week to get ready for cold weather/increased loads next week.  This 
doesn't completely track with ETS understanding that SoCal was withdrawing 
gas from storage this week.

Issue:
ENA is  worried about two things:
Whether it is prudent to sell generation at high prices counting on the 
ability under the soft cap to demonstrate that costs exceed $150/MW.
Whether gas will be curtailed & if so what are ENA's obligations

EES is likewise concerned about curtailments to its customers (utilities have 
been curtailing, but not yet down to the core level).    If EES is curtailed 
by the utility, they don't have an obligation to the industrial to keep 
serving them.   But if the utility is operating under the diversion section 
of its tariff to meet core customers needs, the utility can require that the 
marketer keep their gas on or pay a penalty.  ENA is EES' supplier.  If EES 
load is cut, ENA might face the choice of keeping the gas on and being paid a 
diversion payment or paying a penalty under the utility tariff.

Action Steps:
Steve formed a task force to study how curtailment/diversion/force majeure 
risks play out at each chain across the gas and electric grid in California.  
Once completed, he wants to undertake this analysis for the east coast, 
Alberta, TX and Florida regions.
Develop a PR campaign.  Steve's preference would be to get out early with a 
message about what is going on in the California gas market.  In essence, he 
would like to be on the offensive with a message that the problem is (1) that 
utilities are gambling with ratepayer money -- not filling storage, not 
entering fixed price deals; and (2) the electric price cap is also causing 
strange behavior in the markets.   The ENA traders do not support this 
strategy.  They prefer to lay low, arguing that the PR strategy did not work 
in the California electric market.

Wow--softball questions.  Two thoughts:  1, should we be gentler on the "lack 
of takeaway capacity" issue?  Steve would know how to play this given Socal's 
position.  2,  Did McKinsey check with Enron before taking this assignment 
from Cal?  The lack of conflict of interest rules in the consultant world 
never ceases to amaze me.  That being said, McKinsey is probably the best 
outfit we could hope for to take this investigation over for Cal.  I'd like 
to be on the call to be sure our script for FERC on the neg. rate deals 
dovetails with what we tell these guys.  Let me know when the call will be.  
We may know what the TW FERC order says before this conversation with 
McKinsey happens so lets talk again before the call.  Thanks.  df

Subject: CEC Interviews


McKinsey & Co. has been engaged by the State of California to evaluate 
conditions in the gas market to California.  A Mckinsey representative, 
together with a CEC staffer, asked to interview TW next Wednesday, Mar 28 
(time TBD).  I checked with Steve Kean & he encouraged us to proceed (albeit 
with some caution knowing California's great desire to shift blame).

McKinsey forwarded the attached list of questions.  You'll see that they are 
very general & policy oriented.  I have taken a stab at filling in proposed 
answers.

I'd be happy to field the call (together with Steve Harris if he is 
available).  Let me know if you have feedback and/or prefer to handle the 
call yourself.

$2.5MM SAP accrual which I will use to offset the increase in the Corp 
charges for this year instead of charging to the pipelines.

$5.0 -$6.0MM I hope to be able to carry over to next year.  It depends on the 
$ some costs really come in at.  We did some things in the second quarter to 
hold income back.  I can't  really reverse this year.  If our GPG target does 
go up to $401MM, I will have a $35 MM hole at my level.

I wrote off business development projects and some other things.

The inventory deal is still up in the air.  Rod will know more tomorrow.

At this point in time, even if it happens higher, we will still have a hole.

Maybe they can try the structured products???

Tracy,

Can you tell me what the ($10.2) for Enron Pipeline Company is in the 3CE 
(primarily in Q1 & Q2)?  That seems to be creating the remaining GPG hole for 
the year.

Our officers had been counting on having more reserves to carry into 2001 to 
help fill the NNG and TW gaps.  I also heard from Bob that the inventory deal 
may still be viable at a higher amount - more like $20MM.  Do you have any 
updates on that?

Thanks,  Elaine

I'm OK with trying what the commercial group wants but we'd better be aware 
of the consequences.  If we are successful, it may be a little easier to get 
Kent his authority to buy third party storage from other pipelines.  If we 
are unsuccessful, getting Kent's thing approved will get a bit harder.  I 
think the PNM proposal is pretty specific and has a nice operational basis 
that may help our chances somewhat. Also, I'm forwarding to Shelley to get a 
read on any FERC policy landmines.  Shelley, the summary of Madden's talk to 
INGAA that you circulated today quoted Madden as saying that FERC will take 
up the Texas Eastern remand soon.  Are we headed in the right direction?  
Looks to me like we may give Madden and his people an opportunity to broaden 
the current policy a bit without fundamentally changing it.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: Re: holding capacity on PNM  

Nothing in my research has indicated that a specific agreement is required in 
order to make this filing.  While it is true that one of the reasons FERC 
rejected the NNG filing in which we sought authority to hold capacity on 
unspecified pipelines was because it was too general, the Commission never 
stated that pipelines must file specific deals in order to comport with the 
Texas Eastern requirements.  I believe that the filing is specific enough to 
address the Commission's concerns because we have narrowed it down to a 
specific portion of a specific pipeline in order to help alleviate a 
constraint on TW's system. The Commission did not require us to have an 
agreement with PG&E for Market Center services, and in fact we did not have a 
deal in place when we made our filing.   While I'm sure it's true that having 
a specific deal in place would make our filing even more convincing, the 
Commercial Group would like to maximize their flexibility to acquire capacity 
on PNM instead of having to ask permission for each deal they do with PNM, 
which is why we would prefer to use the same strategy we successfully 
employed in our Market Center services filing.  

On the Hinshaw issue -- I will forward you the relevant e-mail chain from 
last week.

I didn't see you on the distribution,  please respond to Susan's question on 
timing. 
Susan,  if the capacity is 10,000, what is the rate?  Seems like we need to 
have an agreement that we have all reviewed before we file at a minimum.  do 
we have one? 
How was the Hinshaw issue resolved?

I received several comments from you, and I believe we've resolved the legal 
issue (PNM's Hinshaw status).  Any other comments? (Mary Kay, the answer to 
your question is that Lorraine has been discussing a rate with PNM, and the 
amount of capacity they have available is 10,000.)   Mary Kay and Mary, when 
do you think would be a reasonable time to expect to file this, given the 
Order 637 filings we're working on?  

I've attached my draft again in case you need it.

Thanks.

Everyday heroes are all around us at Enron, living our core values of 
Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in everything they do.  Some 
of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference 
in the workplace around them.  Either way, these special individuals deserve 
to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 Chairman's Award.

As there is more than just one employee living the values at Enron, this 
award program will honor 10 employees as members of the Chairman's 
Roundtable.  From that group, the one individual most embodying our values 
will be presented with the Chairman's Award at the Management Conference in 
San Antonio in November.

The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee-driven 
from beginning to end.  From your nominations, an international employee 
committee will select the Chairman's Roundtable and eventually, the 
Chairman's Award winner.  Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is 
extremely vital to the program's success.  If someone has made a positive 
impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and 
send it to Charla Reese by October 1, 2000.  You may click here for a 
printable form:  http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom/form3.doc

For more information on the Chairman's Award, including details on last 
year's Roundtable members and previous winners, Repit Suliyono and Bobbye 
Brown, please click here: http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom

Again, this is a very special award at Enron and we sincerely thank you for 
your participation.

serious business reasons (i.e., cost and functionality) not to use the ENA

if the right people are in Networks instead of ENA.  I'll call you tomorrow.

Subject: Risk System Alternatives Next Steps

Lee,
Just to recap the meeting with Richard Burchfield and Steve Stock, based on 
the requirements that you and Vernon have identified, we would need to use 
several of the system components including TAG, ERMS, GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, 
CREDIT, and UNIFY for settlements.  All of these applications are tightly 
integrated.  We considered moving them into the ETS environment which would 
separate the applications, but this would be a very large undertaking and 
would be a resource intensive effort.  Therefore, due to the size, complexity 
and integration of the applications, the group came to the conclusion that it 
would be more timely and cost effective from an inception as well as 
maintenance standpoint that ETS would have to share these systems with the 
marketing group, and that porting them to the ETS environment as separate 
application images would not be good from an overall migration as well as 
support standpoint.  Additionally, we considered the EnPower System which is 
also integrated into GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, CREDIT and UNIFY.  We are planning 
on a demo Friday morning, but there may be some functionality that you all 
are looking for related to gas that EnPower cannot provide at this time and 
would require some customization.  We'll know more tomorrow after the demo.

Regarding security, these applications are secured to segregate the data, but 
we need an approval from Legal that it would be ok to use shared resources 
from the IT standpoint.  This would include application developers and 
database administrators.  Additionally, we would have to go through the 
process of verifying that there would be no security leaks where it would be 
possible for a marketer to run a report on pipeline related data, etc...  If 
we can get an ok from Legal regardinig sharing of resources, then one of 
these options can be explored further, but if we cannot get approval on 
sharing of resources, it doesn't look like porting either of these 
applications into the ETS environment as standalone apps would be the most 
timely or cost effective way to go at this time.  Can you get a stand from 
Legal regarding this issue?  Thanks.

PG&E Corp. Pursues Multiple Generation Projections, Looks Outside of=20
California
for Profits
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG) announced that it will acquire a 44.4 MW wind power
generating station near Palm Springs, Calif., to supply electricity to
the Western power grid. PG&E subsidiary National Energy Group is purchasing
the plant from Seawest Wind Power Inc., a San Diego-based developer of
wind energy plants. PG&E expects the plant to enter commercial operation
in the spring of 2001.

ANALYSIS: This is just the latest in what appears to be a generation boom
for PG&E Corp. Just over the last two months, PG&E Corp. also has announced
several other generation projects, both within California and in other
strategic areas of the country. National Energy Group (NEG)=01*PG&E Corp.'s
unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast, primarily
in New England=01*is spearheading all of the new generation projects. PG&E
Corp. claims that its goal is for NEG to be in a position to contribute
30 percent of earnings for the parent company by 2002. Thus, the accelerate=
d
increase of megawatts under the NEG banner certainly is working toward
that goal.

Let's take a quick look at the other generation projects that PG&E Corp.
has announced in addition to the Palm Springs wind power facility. Just
last week, NEG announced a long-term tolling agreement with Southaven Power=
,
an affiliate of Cogentrix Energy. Under terms of the agreement, NEG's=20
subsidiary
PG&E Energy Trading gains rights to the total generation capacity produced
at an 810-MW natural-gas fueled, combined cycle located in Mississippi,
just south of the Tennessee border near Memphis. The deal is noteworthy
because it positions NEG close to the existing TVA and Entergy electric
substations that will deliver the plant's electricity into the region's
transmission grid.

This announcement followed other substantial projects in Southern Californi=
a
and Oregon. The 500-MW Otay Mesa Generating Project, located in San Diego
County, is in the final stages of plant siting. The project represents
the first new power plant built in San Diego County in almost three decades
and, of course, will become operational during a time when low supplies
in California continue to drive up prices. In Oregon, NEG has just submitte=
d
an application to build a new plant in Hermiston, Ore., adjacent to an
already-existing 474-MW plant that NEG co-owns with PacifiCorp. The propose=
d
Umatilla Generating Project will be a combined cycle combustion turbine
that will burn natural gas, with its fuel supply transported via the NEG's
Pacific Northwest natural-gas pipeline.

The growth of NEG is a real success for PG&E Corp. at a time when its=20
regulated
subsidiary is struggling. PG&E Company, the utility that provides natural
gas and electric service to approximately 12 million people in Northern
and Central California, has accumulated about $2.9 billion in debt. PG&E
Co. buys a great deal of the power it provides to customers on the wholesal=
e
market, but because of a retail rate freeze that is still in effect the
company has little control over the rates it can charge customers. Thus,
over the course of last summer, PG&E Co. was paying up to 19 cents per
kilowatt hour while it was only able to charge its customers on average
5 cents per kilowatt hour. PG&E remains embroiled in negotiations with
the CPUC over its petition to retroactively bill customers for its debt.

While the regulated PG&E Co. could find itself wallowing in the red dependi=
ng
on regulatory rulings, NEG has soared. In the 2Q of 2000, PG&E Corp. report=
ed
second quarter earnings from operations of $0.69 per share on a diluted
basis, or $253 million, which represented a 38-percent over diluted earning=
s
from operations in the same quarter in 1999. Much of this success can be
attributed to NEG, which reported 2Q earnings of $37 million, which reflect=
ed
a 233-percent profit increase from the previous year's quarter. The winning
streak continued into 3Q, in which PG&E Corp. reported diluted earnings
from operations at $0.68 per share, or $248 million, and revenues of $7.5
billion, compared with third quarter 1999 revenues of $6.2 billion. This
constituted a 22-percent increase in profit for the parent company. Again,
NEG performed very well; NEG contributions rose, with diluted earnings
from operations of $0.10 per share, or $37 million, on revenues of $5 billi=
on.


Clearly, PG&E Corp. has benefited greatly from NEG's ability, as an=20
unregulated
subsidiary, to sell power outside of the regulated California market. Thus,
it is no wonder that, although PG&E Corp. still considers California to
be an attractive market, the core driver of its strategy is NEG, which
is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated.
In addition, the plant siting process in California historically has been
quite restrictive and lengthy, which also may explain why PG&E Corp. has
chosen to focus its generation efforts primarily outside of its own state.
The siting process in California shows signs of becoming more facile. In
fact, just yesterday, the California Energy Commission adopted emergency
regulations to implement the state's new six-month power plant licensing
process. The new regulations allow for "environmentally advanced" power
plants=01*such as PG&E's wind power plant in Palm Springs=01*to be licensed=
 and
come online more quickly in California.

Currently, PG&E Corp. has ownership and arrangement interests in more than
30 plants, the bulk of which are managed by NEG. The company's generation
portfolio currently consists of 7,000 MW, and more than 10,000 MW in new
power plant development and construction is in production.  As PG&E Corp.
continues to expand its generation base, it probably realizes that current
industry intelligence indicates that a company must have at least 30,000
MW in order to be a formidable player. By comparison, a company like AEP=01=
*
clearly
one the top generation companies in the industry=01*has a worldwide generat=
ing
capacity of 38,404 MW. As NEG is PG&E's primary growth vehicle at the prese=
nt
time, I think we can expect to see additional generation projects announced
by this subsidiary.

Some questions remain. Will PG&E Corp. split its unregulated and regulated
operations into two stand-alone companies, as other utilities such as AEP
and Reliant have recently announced? I checked with my sources at PG&E
Corp., and the official company position is that there are no plans to
restructure in this way at this time. However, PG&E Corp. does acknowledge
the dilemma between asking regulators for the right to bill customers for
its regulated company's debt, while showing a 26-percent profit increase
from its unregulated business.

Also, what are the prospects for PG&E Corp.'s hydroelectric system? Accordi=
ng
to prior agreements, PG&E Corp. was supposed to sell its 3,896-MW=20
hydroelectric
system and the company in fact began to do with a bidding process in Septem=
ber
1999. However, just last August PG&E Corp. petitioned the CPUC to halt
this auction process and instead allow the hydroelectric assets to be sold
from the regulated PG&E Co. to an as-of-yet-unformed unregulated subsidiary
for $2.8 billion. PG&E Corp.'s motivation in this proposal is fairly obviou=
s;
the unregulated subsidiary could reap substantial profits from the sale
of hydropower at market prices. In addition, according to a Sept. 15 report
from Dow Jones Newswires, assuming a book value of about $700 million for
the hydroelectric system, PG&E Corp. could take the remaining $2.1 billion
to pay off the transition debts incurred by PG&E Co. The CPUC and PG&E
Corp. continue to interface regarding the value of the hydroelectric system
and whether or not PG&E Corp. should be allowed to sell the assets to an
unregulated company. While this debate rages on, NEG is free to continue
along its aggressive growth mode.

Subject: Gas Processors Report


	


I received a call from Doug Gill, a reported for the Gas Processors Report, a 
small publication that is similar to Gas Daily.
(1 800 874 2544 ext 121)

He stated he had written a report on shutting down processing plants being 
shut down, and the impact to Processors. (He is faxing me that particular 
publication)

He was interested in doing an article on the impact that gas processing 
shutdowns has had to pipeline operations.

Per Doug: 'nobody is quoted'. With all the issues we have going on, I didn't 
know if we wanted to take advantage of this opportunity or fully decline this 
opportunity.

Subject: iBuyit Payables Workflow Tool Stakeholder Kickoff Luncheon March 20

To All -

I have been asked to be the Legal Department stakeholder for the final 
development and implementation of the iBuyit program.  Basically, iBuyit is 
an intranet based procurement and payables systems being developed for 
implementation across Enron.  It is intended that this system will become the 
standard method for purchasing any number of services and for paying the 
invoices associated with these purchases.

As a stakeholder, it is my responsibility to assist with the development of 
the product and its marketing (internal to the various Enron Legal 
Departments).  In order to ensure that the development and implementation run 
as planned, the program calls for the appointment of "Change Agents," - 
defined as:

"individuals who are highly respected within their area and known as the 'GO 
TO' people among their peers."

Though I am sure this definition fits each of you to a tee within your 
respective departments, I am also well aware that schedules may prohibit you 
from being the Change Agent.  Accordingly, what I am in need of is assistance 
in designating that one person within your respective departments who can 
become the Change Agent for your group.  The responsibilities of this 
position are the following:

 - to disseminate communications regarding the project
- to develop awareness and ownership of the product among their department
- to encourage use of the product
- identify those who will need training
- encourage peer training attendance 
- engage in rumor control (basically relay the facts of the program and not 
the myths (e.g., the product will replace jobs))

In picking the appropriate candidate, I would make sure that he/she has a 
working knowledge of the procurement and payables practices of your group, 
together with knowledge of the SAP system.  Since the iBuyit system will 
interface with SAP, this latter knowledge would be very useful.

Please let me know as soon as possible who is the likely candidate from your 
group so that I can meet with them and bring them up to speed on the 
program.  For your benefit, I have attached below the general information 
that has been provided to stakeholders about  the program.

If any of you should have any questions, please call me.

Thanks.

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

Note:  This is significant for the total energy picture in Wisconsin.  While 
this plant is on ANR's system, we could see continued problems throughout the 
winter for the electric generation in Wisc.

News Releases 

Alliant Energy's WP&L Experiences Winter Power Supply "Close Call" 

MADISON- Dec. 12, 2000- Wisconsin Power and Light Co. (WP&L), Alliant 
Energy's Wisconsin utility subsidiary, experienced a power supply "close 
call" Monday evening. The company appealed to customers for voluntary 
conservation measures and exercised its interruptible customer contracts to 
maintain system reliability.

"While we have heard regular reports of this type of situation occurring over 
the past few days in California, this is the first time we have appealed to 
customers for emergency conservation measures in the winter," says Bill 
Harvey, president, Alliant Energy - WP&L. Harvey says the lack of electric 
generation supply in Wisconsin coupled with limited transmission import 
capabilities continues to put Wisconsin's power supply at risk. "There is 
very little cushion available, which makes dealing with emergencies like we 
had last night very challenging, and potentially very dangerous," says Harvey.

At approximately 7:00 p.m. last night, 300 megawatts of generation supply 
went off-line at WP&L's South Fond du Lac plant due to a fuel intake problem. 
The loss of this generation represented approximately 12.5% of WP&L's total 
Wisconsin generation capacity. High electric demand within the state and a 
constrained transmission system made obtaining replacement power virtually 
impossible. WP&L declared a system emergency, exercised its interruptible 
contracts and appealed to the public for voluntary conservation. The 
emergency status resulted in freeing up transmission capacity. WP&L was then 
able to bring on-line additional peaking capacity and obtain power from 
outside the state. Customer conservation efforts also played an important 
role in avoiding more serious power supply consequences.

"Thanks to our customers who conserved electricity last night and the hard 
work from our power supply team overnight, we are back to normal this 
morning," says Harvey. Harvey notes that winter power supply problems are 
rare, but are potentially much more serious and difficult to manage than 
summer problems. The circumstances surrounding last night's problems were 
particularly challenging. "The snow storm caused many businesses to shut down 
early, so we knew there was not going to be a great deal of power to be saved 
by exercising our interruptible contracts," says Harvey. "We appreciate the 
conservation efforts of our customers last night who turned off holiday 
decorative lights, delayed laundry and running their dishwasher."

WP&L and other Wisconsin utilities keep a percentage of their total 
generation, called spinning reserve, operating beyond what is required to 
meet current demand to deal with potential emergencies. With the loss of the 
300 megawatts of generation from the South Fond du Lac plant last night, 
WP&L's spinning reserves dropped below safe levels, prompting the emergency 
actions. "Issuing a public appeal and exercising our interruptible contracts, 
while unusual, was a prudent and conservative course of action given the 
weather conditions," says Harvey. The fuel intake problem at the South Fond 
du Lac plant has been resolved and WP&L's system has returned to normal 
operations today.

Over the last several days, the one transmission line connecting Wisconsin to 
power supplies in the west has been operating a maximum capacity, providing 
little or no ability to import additional power into the state. Local 
opposition to additional natural gas-fired and wind powered generation has 
delayed the construction of new in-state power sources. Harvey says the lack 
of new infrastructure results in a very troubling situation.

"The consequences of rotating blackouts in the winter are very serious, 
particularly with weather as harsh as we are currently experiencing," says 
Harvey. "Last night presented yet another clear indication of why Wisconsin 
needs to move forward, and do so quickly, to ensure the construction of 
needed additional electric infrastructure."

Dan,

I'll check with ENA again on the currency swap.  I have spoken with the a 
couple of times about these and they indicate that it is being circulated 
through Law on their side (very slow).
The Lyons base gas sale contract will be a fixed price sale contract pursuant 
to NNG's rate schedule SF (I would not consider this contract to be a 
derivative, it is a sale pursuant to an approved FERC rate schedule).  Morgan 
is working with Legal to create this contract.
I thought that the NNG/TW amendment of terms had been completed.  I'll check 
with Drew, and if they are not completed we should be able to complete these 
in a couple of days (thanks for the heads-up)
Regarding the October purchase contracts: I'll forward this to Morgan for his 
handling of that issue.
Regarding the monthly sale to Kansas Gas:  I'm not familiar with this 
agreement???

I'll be in Houston on Monday and Tuesday if you want to catch me on any of 
these issues.

Kent

Subject: Derivatives missing confirmations or contracts

Here is the current status of known derivative contracts which have 
outstanding paperwork. 

1. ENA Canadian Dollar Swap, - Kent Miller sent an e-mail to ENA he has 
received no response.
2. Oxy forward sale on Lyons base gas withdraw.  - We need a copy of this 
contract.  This contract is a derivative, we are using the 10 b. exclusion 
but we need to document that the contract qualifies for this exclusion.  
Otherwise the contract will need to be MTM.
3. NNG/TW intercompany amendment of terms for TransCanada.  

Also we need to remind everyone that gas purchases need an underlying 
contract.  AA has scheduled an audit of our gas purchases, additionally 
purchases cannot be approved without an underlying contract.

We have two purchases made for Oct. gas in which we could not locate an 
underlying contract.  
They are:
1. TransCanada
2. OGE 

Please forward all gas purchase base underlying contracts to Mark Walton.

We also are making monthly sales at Cunningham on a delivery into Kansas 
Gas.  I don't have a contract nor do we receive enough information on this 
sale to determine if the value received is correct.  Do you wish for us to be 
involved in the administration of this sale or can I leave this to Morgan.

Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance

The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American 
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western 
Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, 
PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the 
Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high 
load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge 
new rival for Western Canadian supply. 

"The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first 
of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the 
TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at 
about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly," said Klaus Exner, director 
of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. "The big picture overview that 
I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and 
California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down 
that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and 
into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
letting up." 

PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been 
running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to 
non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. "We're turning back demand 
right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora 
[Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries 
are fixed. We're delivering as much as we can deliver right now." 

TransCanada's other major export route out of the Western Canadian 
Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the 
Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. "We didn't see a 
huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. We've seen the IT volumes come 
up considerably," said Exner. "The one thing that has changed is the 
volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination 
changes and we're seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations, 
according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a 
higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price 
differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates 
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not." 

Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running 
flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial 
service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase 
flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas 
flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would 
be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. "We haven't cranked up 
the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably won't do that for a 
couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, I'm not sure 
Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific 
Northwest and California."

Mike, I hadn't seen your email when we talked today.  I'm fine with whatever 
approach you want to take with the documents.  I'll call in for the meeting 
with Stan tomorrow.  I have the phone number.  Sorry we got cut off on the 
MOPS issue today.  I'm a little communication impaired up here, but I'll call 
on Wed. or Thur. on MOPS.  in the mean time, please grab whoever you need 
from my group to get the thinking underway on the new strategy.  Thanks.  DF

These look fine to me. My sense is that Stan will go over Northern's offer in 
the initial phone call with Ted Davis; therefore it may make sense to just 
combine the two for Stan's purpose but keep the 2nd one seperate as the basis 
for a document to fax to Davis after the phone call.

Assuming we keep Arthur Anderson on board this afternoon and assuming Enron 
is still in the business of doing asset monetizations like this one (which 
better be the case since its in the TW 4th Q plan @$2.5 mm), the following 
things need to happen on roughly the following timetable:

1.  Mike talks to Hanover and we negotiate the price, specific contract 
language, etc.  (hopefully within 2-3 weeks of turning Mike loose?)

2.  Regulatory (assisted by Maria and me) flanges up the FERC abandonment 
filing and tees it up to file the minute Mike finalizes the deal with 
Hanover.  We haven't talked about this for a while, but the story we tell  
FERC has to acknowledge that the monthly O&M cost will be higher under our 
outsourcing deal than it currently is, if load factor and other operating 
assumptions remain constant.   That may be the key to our story line--we 
argue that outsourcing is necessary to creating flexibility in our cost 
structure to protect us and our ratepayors from market changes, gas flow 
changes, and capacity turnbacks.  The Compression Services Agreement, as it 
is currently drafted, has a two part demand-commodity rate.  Thus, if our 
throuput goes to pot on the segments where these outsourced compressors are, 
or if we have big capacity turnbacks, the outsource deal allows us to shed 
costs quickly.  Charlie's preliminary cost spreadsheets seem to me to support 
this strategy.  I'll talk to Maria and MKM's team about this.  Also, we need 
to be able to explain to explain that our deal is not all that new or 
radical.  It is just a tiny bit different from the many deals FERC has seen 
where compression or other services are outsourced from the get-go with new 
facilities.  For example, FERC allowed NNG to outsource compressor motor 
operation and ownership using ECS (and, by tomorrow, hopefully will allow TW 
to do the same at Gallup).  Florida has a similar deal, as well as 
intrastates like HPL.  Maria and I and MKM's folks need to turn over every 
rock to find examples of similary outsourcing that don't involve Enron.  We 
need to let FERC know that the outsourcing train has already left the station 
and we just want to jump on board.         

3.  We get the abandonment order in the 4th Q and do the deal.  (Will we have 
the chance to do some more schmoozing and lobbying of FERC folks before we 
file--i.e., at a prefiling conference???)  

See how easy these deals are when you use assumptions to eliminate the many 
problems!

Subject: Topock

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Here's an idea:  PG&E's world has changed a bit since they executed the '97 
interconnect agreement.  Back then, I think the majority of Line 300 capacity 
was held by PG&E for the benefit of the core customers.  Some of the capacity 
was held by contract transport customers, but not that much.  (maybe 
100,000-200,000 dth out of 1.14 bcf/d??)   Now, I understand that PG&E still 
retains some line 300 capacity for the core, but a lot more of it is 
allocated out to contract transport customers.  Do you guys know how much was 
in each of those buckets then and now?  My theory is as follows:

1.  As to the capacity that it retains in its own name for the benefit of its 
core customers, PG&E has absolute discretion as to how to use the capacity.  
They can nominate and schedule volumes at TW/Topock some days and nom. and 
schedule zero on others.  They can be totally arbitrary and not schedule 
anything for extended periods even though they are paying demand charges on 
TW and may incur costs on their gas purchase contracts in the San Juan or 
elsewhere (eventually this would get the CPUC's attention, I guess).  Even if 
there were no interconnect agreement or operating agreement with TW on the 
pcb issue, there is just not much we can do to control how PG&E dispatches 
gas supply.

2.  PG&E's transport contracts with third parties are a different story.  
Those parties, not PG&E,  decide how much to nom. every day.  If PG&E is 
going to refuse to schedule a valid nom. from a transport customer, PG&E has 
to declare force majeure on its system or declare a capacity 
constraint-related curtailment.  PG&E has some discretion as a prudent 
operatory of its system, but not nearly as much discretion as it does as to 
its own portfolio.  

3.  If 1 and 2 are correct, then the question arises:  Does PG&E have to 
declare force  majeure on its own system in order to shut us down at Topock?  
If the amount of capacity they have in bucket no. 1 above exceeds 300 
million/d, they may be able to shut us down and continue to honor all of 
their transport contracts.  But what if PG&E's transport customers continue 
to nominate TW/Topock even though PG&E is making alternative receipt point 
capacity available for them at El Paso Topock or somewhere else?  If TW 
stands by ready to confirm those customers' noms, then I think we can force 
PG&E to declare force majeure on its own system.  

4.  I'm not sure no. 3 above makes any difference for us.  At minimum, it 
focuses the attention on PG&E and not us.  Remember Erin Brockovich?  They 
will hate that.  I'm sure their spin doctors will point the finger at us, but 
once they declare force majeure, the PR damage is done.  Also, and more 
importantly, the standards applying to PG&E's declaration of force majeure 
are much more stringent than the standards under the operating agreement.   
We will probably have a much stronger position in litigation if the issue is 
"did PG&E have adequate basis for declaring force majeure" than if the issue 
is "did TW violate the 1 ppm standard under the operating agreement."  

Please let me know what we know about the capacity situation on Line 300 and 
give me any reactions to this idea.  Thanks. DF

The disclosure proposed for the 3rd Quarter Noteholders' report is the exact 
same wording as was used in the 2nd Qtr Noteholders' Report and is consistent 
with the language and level of detail insisted upon by AA and used in the 
1999 NNG Audited Financial Statements (Brown Cover Report).  Although AA has 
no say in what we include in the Noteholders Reports, I believe our Offering 
Circulars require that we use GAAP for interim financial reports, even though 
they are unaudited.

Thanks Jeff, ETS Operations would be glad to look at these and any other 
"potential" opportunity to operate 3rd party facilities. Don Hawkins is 
heading up the "endless possibilities" for us. I did copy him on this reply, 
Don is based in Houston. 

I 'am currently in Amarillo Texas with the SW Operation Directors and I will 
discuss this with Rich.

THANKS for the partnership.

		 Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Trends for Commodity Trading, Supply Chain Exchanges Explored at Conference

Approximately 200 industry executives were in attendance at the first day
of the Energy Exchanges Online conference, held Monday through Wednesday
of this week in Scottsdale, Ariz. The conference was presented by London-ba=
sed
EyeforEnergy. In morning keynote presentations from Mark Crosno, executive
vice president of Altra Energy Technologies, and Keith Butler, COO,=20
DukeSolutions,
issues of how deregulation and the Internet have spawned a new species=01*t=
he
e-utility=01*were discussed. A key focus of the conference was the growing
focus on online exchanges and how the entire value chain for the wholesale
energy market is being impacted by new technologies.

ANALYSIS: I attended and also spoke on a panel discussion during the first
day of this conference. What I found particularly noteworthy about the
dialogue taking place was that, despite participation from diverse sectors
of the energy industry=01*utilities, regulators, consultants, ESPs, IT=20
infrastructure
providers, and others=01*several key points were reiterated throughout the
discussion.

First, there is little doubt left that e-commerce and new technologies
are changing the entire complexion of the energy industry. Resulting from
that dynamic, energy companies presently find themselves in a transformatio=
n
related to how they will and should conduct their businesses. While new
technologies certainly offer new opportunities for companies to expand
information and services that already exist in an electronic form, question=
s
still remain about how much the market itself will bear in terms of buildin=
g
new online exchanges for e-commerce.

As noted, the conference focused on online exchanges. Within my presentatio=
n,
I discussed that essentially four different kinds of exchanges have emerged
within the last 20 months: supply chain, commodity trading, transmission,
and retail exchanges. A supply chain exchange exists primarily to line
up buyers and sellers of parts related to the energy industry, with the
end goals of lower product prices and procurement processing costs, exposur=
e
to a worldwide audience, and shorter order and fulfillment cycles. A commod=
ity
trading exchange exists for companies engaged in bulk wholesale trading
to buy and sell energy packages. A new form of exchange is emerging with
transmission exchanges. We don't know a whole lot about them yet, but a
group of utilities in the Midwest recently proposed a transmission exchange
that would "be the electronic clearinghouse of information flow around
transmission assets and the market." How a transmission exchange would
correlate with an RTO=01*which also manages transmission flow=01*is not yet=
 clear.
Finally, the retail online providers could also be considered a form of
exchange in that they are operating exclusively across the Internet.

With that established, several key issues will rise to the forefront in
2001 as many exchanges finally come online and the new business segment
enters its second year. First and foremost, establishing neutrality seems
to be the primary challenge. Questions were raised at the conference about
trading exchanges established by a proprietary participant that is involved
in every buy or sell on that particular exchange. The general consensus
among those present at the conference was that, although concerns about
neutrality have not prevented exchanges such as EnronOnline from becoming
very successful, regulatory pressure from the FTC may eventually make=20
neutrality
a requirement. In addition, when given a choice over various exchanges
on which to participate, the sense that I got from the dialogue was that
traders would arguably prefer to participate on an exchange where issues
of disclosing competitive information are not a concern.

The second trend as we move forward is liquidity. With regard to commodity
exchanges, what participants want and what makes an exchange the most=20
successful
is liquidity (meaning, essentially, the amount of transactions on the excha=
nge
and, consequently, the opportunity to access beneficial deals). A point
that I made in my presentation is that the larger exchanges naturally seem
to have the most liquidity. Again, the example of EnronOnline, which=20
reportedly
has now logged over $200 billion in transactions, cannot be overlooked.
This raises the question of whether or not smaller exchanges will even
find opportunities to move into such a saturated market. As a result, a
related trend that I see is the consolidation of existing exchanges, along
with a blending of current business models into one exchange format. As
companies realize that it is already fairly late in the game to be building
an exchange, the smart move may be to join or merge with an already-existin=
g
format. I think we will also see multiple exchanges merging into one to
gain a lock on various market niches.

The third trend that should emerge over the next year is the separation
of commodities. Traders will want the flexibility of having separate platfo=
rms
for different commodities, including power, natural gas, bandwidth, etc.
Dynegydirect is already moving in that direction by offering separate tradi=
ng
floors that allow traders to group products in a customized way. I think
we will see more and more of this trend as traders demand this option.

The trends I mentioned here have focused mostly on commodity trading. That
is primarily due to the fact that we simply don't know enough about how
several prominent supply chain exchanges will operate. Enporion just last
week logged its first transactions (five reverse auctions in which UGI
was the buyer of natural gas). Pantellos still has another month or so
before it comes online. Of course, there are many smaller supply chain
exchanges like UtilityFrontier (municipal-oriented), RAPIDpartsmart and
Bex.com, but the general consensus at the conference was that all supply
chain exchanges will need to provide significant cost savings for=20
participants,
and that has yet to be universally demonstrated. Most observers of this
particular trend are reserving judgment until next year when real-time
results are disclosed.

Moreover, the evolving energy marketplace is providing many new opportuniti=
es
for energy companies to redefine themselves and develop new business models=
.
However, much of the water that energy companies may be venturing into
is uncharted territory. The risks and competition associated with building
an online exchange can be formidable, and may dissuade some energy companie=
s
from developing in that direction. The question is, as we move further
down the path of an e-based energy industry, can energy companies avoid
participation in some form of an exchange? As always, the answer will proba=
bly
be found along the bottom line, which for many of these exchanges should
emerge sometime over the next year.

Good--the "to the extent that" phrase is appropriately ambiguous on what 
actually happened--should make Harris happy.  DF

     Subscribers to TheLaw.net's Custom Web Browser already know that the 
days of submitting solely to the "Wexis" duopoly are over.

     Why limit your options to cherry-picking subscription slices from the 
Wexis pay-per-view menu when TheLaw.net offers an all-you-can-eat, unlimited 
access buffet for under $25 a month annualized; a subscription that has as 
its centerpiece unlimited access to the largest searchable database of 
Federal and state appellate case law on the planet next to those provided by 
the big-two compusearchers. Personal Editions are just $295 a year. Annual 
Workgroup Editions are just $995 for the first five users. 
http://www.thelaw.net/subscribe.htm

--MORE THAN JUST CASE LAW
     Wexis, of course, offers us a vast array of high-quality resources, with 
many slick bells and whistles. But for most of us, these resources exist in 
name only and deviating from the plan usually means getting hammered with 
unwieldy transaction charges. In contrast, TheLaw.net puts cases, statutes, 
regulations, rules, forms, news, executive agency databases, legislative 
tracking tools, full-text law journals, a massive reference desk and Federal, 
state and local court resources just a click or two away on your desktop.

     As legal research and reference materials continue to migrate online the 
commercial value of this information bottoms out for the few who have the 
time and talent to find it scattered among the thousands of servers 
controlled by governments, academia and non-profits. For the rest of us, 
there's TheLaw.net

--NO RISK 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
     Your no risk Personal, Convenience or Workgroup Edition includes an 
unconditional 30 day money-back guarantee. Five attorneys in a firm or 
workgroup, for example, get unlimited use for an entire year for just $995; 
individual users for just $295. You'll be up and running in minutes and we 
can deliver your software today!

The mission of ETS Operations Technical Services (OTS) remains unchanged.  
Our goal is to be an integral part of field operations, provide the highest 
level of technical support possible and assist the field operations teams in 
achieving their objectives.  To that end and as a part of ETS's on-going 
transition of merging  ETS's and EOTT's Operations, I am pleased to announce 
a realignment of ETS Operations Technical Services.  

The purpose of these changes is to better align our technical resources with 
the new Operations Areas and teams and better serve their needs.  Therefore, 
we will form Area Technical Support Teams for each of the Technical 
disciplines (Corrosion, Measurement and Controls & Electrical):  

Max Brown, Director of Corrosion Services, will lead the Corrosion teams.
Kenneth Cessac, Director of Measurement Services, will have responsibility 
for the Measurement Support teams.
Ken Crowl, Director of Controls and Electrical Services will provide 
leadership to the C&E teams.  
Steve Klimesh, Business Consultant, will provide on-going support to ETS on 
UAF and other continuous improvement initiatives.   
The Clifton and Beaver machines shops will remain a part of OTS as we 
continue to grow the Enron Machine and Mechanical Services business.  

The attached organizational charts show the new Tech Services.  The vacancies 
reflected on the charts are an effort to shore up our technical support staff 
for operating the EOTT assets.  In the coming weeks, our Technical Support 
Teams will be further defining their support roles to the Region and team 
level and working diligently to fill these vacancies.  Any thoughts or 
comments that you might have regarding these changes are certainly 
appreciated.  Please feel free to call me or any of the OTS Directors with 
your feedback or for assistance.  Our goal is to continue to provide the best 
service possible to you, our customers.

Subject: Enron Tag Line Change

Dear Enron Employees:

 With the addition of communications to our core businesses, it is 
appropriate for us to modify our existing tag line to simply "Endless 
possibilities."  This change is effective immediately and replaces our 
current tag line of "Natural gas. Electricity. Endless possibilities."

 To achieve our goal of a unified Enron brand, each employee has the 
responsibility to make the Enron image a consistent and strong identity.  
This is partially accomplished through correct application of the logo and 
tag line.  A revised Corporate Identity Guidelines Book has been developed to 
assist you in following the correct standards.  You may obain a copy of this 
new book by completing a Forms Request and ordering Item #42629.    These 
guidelines will also be made available electronically on the Brand Site at 
home.enron.com.

 We'd like to take this opportunity to remind all of you about the importance 
of maintaining a consistent look, especially with our stationery and business 
cards.  It has come to our attention recently that some employees are having 
these items produced by outside vendors and are not following the established 
guidelines.  This must stop immediately.  Please use the internal resources 
available to you for these items.  They will ensure that all guidelines are 
followed correctly and consistently.  If you have questions on how to get 
these items or on the guidelines, you may contact Marge Nadasky in Corporate 
Identity at marge.nadasky@enron.com.

 One name, one company....one Enron.  Our recent reorganization brings us 
another step closer to realizing this goal.  Please make sure you do your 
part to protect and strengthen the Enron brand around the world.

 Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.


      Office of the Chairman

Britt- great memo.  I'm sure you guys are in the course of discussing these 
very issues, but here's my two cents worth. 
1.  Once we decide on an optimal forum, the key step before filing a lawsuit 
is the assessment of our probability of success--for different reasons than 
is usually the case.  We need to weigh the chances of a favorable judgment 
against El Paso against the probability and extent of collateral damage to 
our defense (not just TW but all of GPG) in Quinque, et al.  
2.  I like our case a lot based on what I've seen so far--if I've got it 
right, our claim is that El Paso breached the 1990 measurement agreement by 
not calibrating the meters as required and therefore by allowing the error to 
arise and remain uncorrected for so long.  Under the NM statute, we may get 6 
years worth of recovery ( or more, I guess, if they did something to toll the 
SOL).  Under the Texas SOL, maybe less.  Do we have a good argument that the 
1% standard in the measurement agreement and the 2% standard in El Paso's 
tariff do not absolve them of conversion or breach liability?  Seems to me 
that El Paso will argue that the FERC tariff preempts our contract 
rights--but I think the law is on our side there.  
3.  The tricky issue then becomes whether our prosecution of the claim 
against El Paso plays into the hands of our adversaries on the Quinque mess.  
If so, how do we quantify that risk to allow a rational balancing of the pros 
and cons.  I'm glad smart guys like you two will have to do that thinking.  
As usual, I'll try to stay on the sidelines and nod intelligently when you 
make a recommendation.  DF 

PS:  I'm ok with the outside counsel recommendation.

Tony Pryor recommended that I put back into the policy section II A &B so 
that at our meeting tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. we can discuss them.  Please use 
this copy of the draft dated 12/5/00 to discuss from tomorrow.

Subject: ETS risk management policy revisions

I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
Policy. 

Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.

Dan

at the CPUC workshop on the 17th.  I'm not sure where we'll do this--probably 
either Shelley's or Steve's office.  DF

McKinsey & Co. has been engaged by the State of California to evaluate 
conditions in the gas market to California.  A Mckinsey representative, 
together with a CEC staffer, asked to interview TW next Wednesday, Mar 28 
(time TBD).  I checked with Steve Kean & he encouraged us to proceed (albeit 
with some caution knowing California's great desire to shift blame).

McKinsey forwarded the attached list of questions.  You'll see that they are 
very general & policy oriented.  I have taken a stab at filling in proposed 
answers.

I'd be happy to field the call (together with Steve Harris if he is 
available).  Let me know if you have feedback and/or prefer to handle the 
call yourself.

I heard that NE Hub made it through the Oriskany without blowing anything 
up.  Siggy must have been so pleased, and Penn Fuel and CNG so disappointed!  
Hey, I'm gonna be down the week of May 30-June 3 and would like to get 
together with you guys.  What's going on that week?  Would there be any 
reason, say, to bring golf clubs?  I hear that my much ballyhooed former law 
partner David Hill might be down in Houston the same time and I need to have 
a few beers on his expense account as well.  Pat, I don't think you've met 
this guy but you need to, if for no other reason because he buys beers.   DF

I enjoyed meeting with you guys and your team this morning.  Our crack 
certificate people have already responded to my request, as you'll see 
below.  As you get deeper into the process, talking with Michele and her

Attached are a list of the exhibits for a certificate application and the 
environmental requirements (this document is the redline for the new 
environmental regulations under Order No. 603, 603A, & 603B). Within this 
document is the minimum checklist requirements for the environmental report.  
I included everything because ultimately we must provide everything --not 
just the minimum.   If this is too much or not enough let me know.   Also, 
the definition of an affected landowner on new or expansion of the boundaries 
of an existing storage facility includes both surface and subsurface owners 
for landowner notification requirements (such requirements are not included 
in the attached documents).  thanks MW

Do we have anything off the shelf that we could send to some guys at ENA that 
are trying to understand the 7(c) process?  They asked me for something like 
a "checklist" of what you'd have to put in a cert. app. to build and operate 
a new storage project.  Any ideas would be appreciated.  DF

Since PNM is the only party taking issue here, we might do a quickie answer  
clarifying the transportation and fuel language.   This might enable us to 
get the type of netting and trading we want ($ vs. volumes) for both shipper 
and operator imbalances at least until the GISB standards of netting and 
trading are approved.  Maria

I'm inclined to agree that its not worth responding to.  They also argued

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Tony, I need your review and approval asap for the attached E.Dubuque 
delivery products that are "daily" in nature (one is for receipt at Ventura 
and the other is for receipt at Demarc).  The rate aspect is the same 
language as the one-part rates we have already used (designated as "R+C).  
This "Dly" designation means that the term is one day which will be rolled 
over day-to-day unless either party cancels the rollover.  The term language 
shown here is the same as the "daily" language we have been using.  Call me 
with your questions. Thanks. x7067.

Per our discussion last week, this is the status on Pueblo.  I think we need 
to establish to our satisfaction the bona fides of Dennis' government 
contracting scheme before we pitch hard to have ENA get into the deal and 
scrub down the numbers on the power plant.  If our govcon gurus (Bill Votaw 
and Bill Gang--both ex military guys working on DOD outsourcing deals for 
Enron Federal Solutions) buy off on it, then I think we brief Stan at that 
point.  You, Stan and Steve will then need to decide the best way to pitch 
ENA to verify the economics and potentially get into the deal.  Either we'd 
have Stan push from the top down or have Kevin and  Steve go directly to the 
ENA deal guys.  More to follow.

Subject: Pueblo

I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager for 
the Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and 
Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts 
team might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next 
week or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their 
outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the key--he 
is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my 
old firm in DC.  The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all 
through their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretations 
and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD.  Bill and Bill--does such a 
meeting sound productive?  If so, should we have outside govt. contracts 
counsel present and if so, who do you suggest?  

On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that 
he was in the middle of a "big drafting project"--revising Dennis' joint 
venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my 
concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this 
deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be 
revisited.   Thanks for your patience on this project.  DF

At the suggestion of Robert Jones (you remember him--one of the growing 
legion of ex-GPG HR representatives), I interviewed a lady named Emma Caplan 
yesterday.  She is the wife of a guy that Enron Networks brought over to 
Houston from London.  She is a "Solicitor" in the English legal system, and 
got her law degree at the University of Wales.  She has not taken an American 
bar exam but may be able to take DC or New York.  For some reason related to 
practice of foreign lawyers in TX, she can't take the TX bar until she has 
gotten a US law degree.  This person is very bright, personable, and 
enthusiastic.  She is extremely interested in working for Enron, either as a 
lawyer once she gets her license squared away, or in a paralegal or analyst 
position until then. I left a copy of her resume with Emily, and I'd ask that 
she please forward it to each of you.  If any of you have need for such an 
individual or have ideas she should pursue within Enron (or outside Enron), 
please call Robert or myself.  Thanks.  DF

Please follow up with Lou on this.  It sounds like something the commercial 
people would be in a good position to answer, so maybe start by finding out 
if they are already responding, either through Lou or otherwise.  Then get 
the right people to review and supplement this list.  Thanks. df

Subject: ETS Products/Services

EHS Corporate has asked we verify this inventory of services/products  from 
all of the various companies that fit under the very broadest form of the ETS 
umbrella.  I offer the following thoughts:  I don't believe EOTT has any 
relationship with the Mt. Belvieu storage operations; I don't know if we 
purchase natural gas except for fuel purposes; do we currently have any gas 
gathering facilities?? or just transmission??; EOTT Fleet Vehicles could be 
better defined; Risk Management services??

Feedback would be extremely helpful before the 17th

Lou,

This is a follow-up to a meeting we had about 2 months ago on Life Cycle 
Impact Assessments.  The 1st phase of the assessment involves completing an 
inventory of Enron's products\services and volumes.  I am currently 
requesting each business unit to verify the products and services we have 
identified and make any modifications to the list.  I am enlisting your 
assistance to do this for ETS, including EOTT.  I need to have the 
verification completed by 11/17. Please advise if you have any questions.



Thanks,
Susan Worthen

Absolutely.  I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil
and his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking
etc.  We'll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary
on that project.  On the quick 10 million/day that we've been working on,
there's a potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may
get us the 10 million much quicker and at a lower cost.  Steve Harris and I
talked about it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or
two.  We will be ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup
if the alternative doesn't pan out.  We'll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d
project with the Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes.  DF

Lets make sure we are picking-up on the other ideas Phil has for getting
additional capacity on Tw.  If any of his ideas require regulatory approval
we will probably want to include in the same certificate application.

Jim Fossum is about a hundred years old.  He's been employed by nearly every 
storage developer operating in the state.  We knew him back in the early 90's 
(that's 1990's) when he was trying to sell the "Ten Section" project to 
Mojave Pipeline.   The Ten Section is the project referred to in the press 
clipping near Bakersfield, CA.  Their other project ("Lodi") is in direct 
competition with the "Wild Goose" storage project near Sacramento.

have any interest in this project or other merchant storage in California, 
these are the guys to deal with as they have mapped about 90% of the state 
looking for salt or other storage plays.

CA Merchant Storage Plant Passes Major Test

     California regulators Thursday released a final environmental impact 
report for the
     state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the 
Sacramento
     Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding 
landowners,
     Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage 
project
     operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the 
approval process for
     environmental review. 

     Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project 
in Texas and
     it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in 
the Bakersfield area,
     according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. 

     Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of 
Sacramento should
     come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this 
summer and be
     operational before the end of the year. "We see the environmental report 
as the 'light at
     the end of the tunnel'," Fossum said. 

     Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California 
Public Utilities
     Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) 
identifying the
     project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then 
was circulated
     to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before 
the final
     report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were 
held by the CPUC
     last October. 

     Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative 
law judge
     for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period 
before the
     project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, 
a CPUC
     spokesperson said. 

     "We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already 
have our
     compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and 
that can go pretty
     quickly," Fossum said. "In the best of all worlds it would be this year; 
in the worst case,
     it would be a year from now." 

     Western Hub has some of its customers lined up, and it is in current 
discussions with
     others, said Fossum, declining for competitive reasons to even identify 
the types of
     customers, although they are expected to be large shippers, marketers, 
power plant
     operators and other large industrial customers. 

     The Lodi project is designed for full operation as having a 12 Bcf 
working capacity,
     with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacities. It will 
be
     connected to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone transmission system 
through a
     35-mile pipeline consisting of three miles of 30-inch-diameter and 32 
miles of
     24-inch-diameter pipe. During the past year's delay in start-up, Western 
has "moved
     the pipeline around a bit, but not a whole lot," Fossum said. "to make 
accommodations
     to nearby farmers." 

     Western Hub's similar-sized Texas project is south of San Antonio and 
would be
     connected with three natural gas transmission systems in the area: 
Houston Pipeline,
     PG&E --- Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
"We
     expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 

     Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
the Bakersfield
     area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
expects to have
     more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
California project
     moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 

     Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
have to connect
     with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
The combined
     Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area.

What  about the risk that a bankruptcy trustee could pull the escrow account 
back into the general creditors' estate?  Is that any greater than the risk a 
prepayment would be required to be returned?

I think we do need to review this with Stan and/or Danny (as well as someone 
else in Enron that's managing the bigger picture on PGE credit risk.)

I guess I would argue then he hasn't secured the future business, since it is 
not fully prepaid.      We could raise the amount to cover the days exposed 
and be in a better position.

Subject: PG & E Credit Assurance

 I have spoken with Chris Chung of the PG & E Risk management group in regard 
to the necessary credit assurances TW would require. Chris stated he could 
not provide a letter of credit but would consider a prepayment. He also 
indicated that through his business group he heard as a rumor that we would 
accept a one month valuation. To continue the discussion, I told Chris a 
decision as to the amount would have to be  authorized by my management and 
my proposal as to how the prepayment would work , is PG & E would wire the 
agreed prepayment to us to secure the February business, then make payment 
for the January transportation on the due date in February and then make the 
prepayment on a monthly basis with a true up to the actual invoice. Chris 
countered with PG & E posting a Security Deposit in an Escrow account to 
secure the future transactions. The issue I have with this arrangement is 
that theoretically if PG & E defaults on payment on the due date, we have 
approximately forty days exposure and more until we can suspend service which 
could be an additional thirty days.

 Please review and advise your comments and/or direction. 

 Also, should we review our proposal with other Senior Management before 
responding.

 Regards.

Interesting.  I'll work with MKM and Maria on getting answers to AA's 
questions and comments.  I think we can eliminate the specific cross 
references between the two agreements, but is that the real problem or is AA 
going to choke on our execution of both agreements with the same party?  
(that's a tough one to wire around, if it is their real concern).  Thanks.  DF

I thought that was the point of requesting a December 1 date -- so that the 
Commission had a longer period to act.  Since we requested an effective date 
with more than 30 days advance notice (but less than 60 days per 154.207 of 
the regs), then the Commission has until the effective date to act? ( NGA 
717c.)

Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants; Match for Entergy
in New York
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy,
and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced
that Constellation Nuclear will buy 100 percent of Unit 1 and 82 percent
of Unit 2. Constellation will own a total of 1,550 MW of Nine Mile Point's
1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The total purchase price, including
fuel, is $815 million. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclea=
r
Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the New York Public Utilities Commission
still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase, but Constellation
Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid-2001.

ANALYSIS: This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever=
al
reasons. First, the purchase of the plants expands Constellation's generati=
on
assets, which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the
last year. Secondly, the location of the plants is a critical factor.=20
Constellation
has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region, and New
York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing
field for nuclear assets. Third, owning the Nine Mile Point plants will
elevate Constellation's stature, moving it ever close to become on par
with its nearest competitor in the New York market, Entergy Corp.

Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move
for Constellation Nuclear, let me establish some of the important factors
of the deal. Nine Mile Point is a two-unit boiling water reactor site.
Nine Mile 1 began producing electricity in 1969; Nine Mile 2 began producin=
g
electricity in 1988. The two units are both located in Scriba, N.Y., which
is about 40 miles north of Syracuse. The Nine Mile Point units have had
rather spotty histories, but over the last two years have shown signs of
becoming strong performers. Niagara Mohawk operates both units.

Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several
different utility owners. Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of
Unit 1. Unit 2 is owned by a group of co-owners: Niagara Mohawk (41 percent=
),
New York State Electric & Gas (18 percent), Rochester Gas & Electric=20
Corporation
(14 percent), and Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation (9 percent).
It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase
82 percent of Unit 2 because the Long Island Power Authority, an additional
co-owner that controls 18 percent of Unit 2, has opted not to sell its
share of the plant at this time.

The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service
Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market
value of their plants through an open, competitive process. This is part
of an overall effort to separate generation, transmission and distribution
activities within the state.

With that established, I will continue to support my case that the acquisit=
ion
of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energy's
growth strategy. In early 2000, Constellation began a restructuring of
its corporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments:
one focused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclea=
r)
and the other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant
energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power
in the third quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding
this growth. The goal for the merchant energy business, according to=20
Constellation
Energy CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000
MW of electric generation facilities by 2005. Toward that end, Constellatio=
n
Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage
of "bargain prices for nuclear plants," which resulted in large part from
other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing,
or being mandated, to divest their generation plants.

Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group,
a unit within Constellation Nuclear, was established when Baltimore Gas
& Electric, another Constellation Energy subsidiary, created a new area
for its life-cycle license renewal activities. Thus, most likely Constellat=
ion
will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units,
and has a core group of people with expertise in this area. License renewal=
s
in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC, so there shoul=
d
not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process. The
only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe=
nt
in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC.

Presently, Constellation's generation assets are based in a mixture of
coal and nuclear. The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making
expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset, an 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant
in Southern Maryland. As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the
foreseeable future, buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and
nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases. Thus, Constellation could
be in a prime position if the desire for nuclear-generated power continues
to rise, as the company anticipates. While Constellation will most likely
retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company is clearly moving
closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio. Constellation has justified its
move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear
fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that "the economics [of
nuclear] are quite robust, once they are calculated out."

A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea=
ses
is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a 10-year contract to provide
electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices. Specific terms
of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of its
share of the Nine Mile Point plants' output back to the sellers at an avera=
ge
price of nearly $35/MWh until 2010. This alone should provide a solid rate
of return for Constellation's merchant energy business.

In addition, as I indicated, the New York location is key factor in this
deal. Aside from its large population, the state of New York is home to
a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently. For these
two reasons alone, New York stands out as the center within Constellation's
focus on the Northeastern United States. Yet, Constellation's competitors
also have the same plan, and have all fought to gain assets in the region.


Just within the last few months, Entergy Corp.=01*which also has based its
strategy to a large extent on nuclear=01*has been aggressively making its
own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State. In fact, Entergy
was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders
for the Nine Mile Point plants. I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor=
d,
an Entergy spokesperson, back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was
actively attempting to purchase the two plants. However, despite the loss
of the two Nine Mile Point plants, Entergy retains a very strong nuclear
presence in New York. In late November, Entergy closed the sale on the
New York Power Authority's two nuclear power plants, Indian Point Unit
3 in Westchester County and the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County=
.
In fact, the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest=20
acquisition
to date in Entergy's nuclear strategy, and also represented the highest
purchase price ($967 million) ever of a nuclear asset. Earlier in the same
month, Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point 2 plant from Con
Edison. Altogether, Entergy now controls over 3,000 MW of nuclear generatio=
n
in the state of New York.

Consequently, since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of
the top nuclear power producers in the industry, it will need to match
Entergy (along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke) with regard
to its nuclear portfolio. There is only a limited number of nuclear plants
that will become available for purchase, and thus any acquisition of an
operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in
this particular market.

As a sidenote, I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary
sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants (100 percent of Unit 1 and 41 percent
of Unit 2). It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir=
ed
by National Grid, a U.K. company that is considered one of the world's
largest independent transmission companies. The acquisition of Niagara
Mohawk is supporting National Grid's strategy of becoming a major presence
in the transmission and distribution sectors of the U.S. energy industry.
Generation is not a high priority for National Grid, and the sale of Niagar=
a
Mohawk's nuclear assets resulted from this strategy.

Moreover, once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches
that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States.
Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawk's current strategy,
it is a key component for Constellation Energy. There are certainly risks
associated with both approaches, but the bottom line on this deal, from
my perspective, is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets
in a strong market. It's pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be
a contender in the nuclear arena, especially in New York, and owning the
two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal.

Great to hear from you!  I'll forward this to the smart guys and see if they 
have any interest.  Let me know which pipes you'll interconnect with and 
we'll have a better sense of who else in the organization might be 
interested.  Kent and Morgan, when we get Tony's response on the 
interconnects, can you think it through from Florida's perspective also?  
Thanks.  DF

Attached below is a brochure regarding an upcoming national symposium - The
Reorganizing Energy Industry: Shifting Risks and Opportunities to take place
in Madison, Wisconsin November 29 and 30, 2000.  I am pleased to be
moderating this panel.  Given your role in this important industry, I
believe that there are good reasons why you will want to attend.
The event is sponsored by the Wisconsin Public Utility Institute, The
Federal Energy Bar Association and the Energy & Telecommunications Section
of the Wisconsin Bar and will involve nationally prominent industry
representatives as members of the faculty.  The meeting will include leading
Wall Street investment bankers, numerous regulatory commissioners from a
variety of influential jurisdictions, experts ready to discuss implications
of recent seismic events in the energy markets, and financial analysts and
credit agencies who must evaluate the business strategies of energy
companies to meet this unfolding future, and leading market participants.
 Because the energy industry remains highly regulated, it remains a
market which can be affected dramatically by a small number of people - not
just through their use of  capital in the market, but by their influence
upon the policy makers who are now setting, and will continue to set, the
rules.  The Symposium has been designed to provide an intimate forum for the
exposition and discussion of energy industry policy among a mix of people
who will influence the unfolding energy markets.  Obviously, you and your
organization need to play a leading role in these discussions and  I
sincerely hope you can participate.

Subject: Red Cedar update

Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to 
convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec. 1 exemption for 
gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).  He 
is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his 
proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to 
FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an 
extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many 
years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has 
a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, 
Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail 
anyway!

Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have 
title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might 
just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything 
interesting happens I'll let you know.

A perfected (or nearly perfected) ROW may have some merit, especially as ENA 
continues their negotiations to further develop that power plant in 
Albuquerque.  I'll have Jeff call ENA, and without giving anything away, find 
out how their negotiations are progressing.  I wonder to what extent Dennis' 
agreement with the tribe is transferable?

Subject: Pueblo

Tino called this morning with a quick report.  They are still negotiating 
with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.  The size of the 
plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.  Tino has been 
ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls 
apart.  He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it 
related to the pipeline right of way.  The have a binding 20 year agreement 
with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly 
payment.  I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the 
ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  The question is whether we 
are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis 
has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  I 
told Tino I'd give him a call next week to let him know.  At minimum, I'd 
suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they've got and 
advise us on what its worth.  Your thoughts?  DF

Subject: Re: TW's 637 Filing  

Attached is my redline of your Sat. draft.  In addition to the revisions in 
the doc, I have a few questions and concerns:
1.  On the segmenting section, I think it is a fine legal argument, but it 
lacks something.  What is our "or else" position?  Does the Global Settlement 
give us any FERC-out rights or colorable argument that the entire deal should 
be unwound if FERC screws up the segmenting issue?  I'm not suggesting that 
we should trigger a FERC out if we have one, but if we arguably do, we should 
consider threatening to use it.  I'm afraid we come across as whiny and 
FERC's position will likely be "so what, what are you going to do about it?"  
If we have no arguable "FERC-out" and the only  "or else" we have is that 
we'll take them to Court and force them to adhere to the original deal, I'm 
for leaving the draft as-is.  We can make our appeal threat more direct on 
rehearing if they hose us in the initial order.
2.  On the arbitrage argument, I've taken out any reference to an example and 
softened the verbiage a bit.  I want to leave in the references to the 
arbitrage issue, however, because FERC understands the problem and believes 
it is widespread.  We don't need to prove exactly how big a problem it is on 
our system (although it would have been very effective if we had clear facts).
3.  Do any of the OBA changes arguably conflict with the Global Settlement?  
If so, we'd  better be prepared to eat our words from the segmenting 
section.  Covering ourselves in the sanctity of that Settlement in section 1 
and then fiddling around with it in section 2 won't play well.  It is my 
understanding that the OBA system on TW was not part of the turnback 
resolution deal so I hope this won't be a problem.  
4.  On FN 20, I'd suggest we use Vig's data and chart for May of 2000.  The 
arb opportunity is huge and clear.  We reference in the FN that we use all 
six of the Gas Daily price points, and I think Vig used just 3.  What's the 
right answer?     

Good work everyone--please give it one more careful look on Monday AM and it 
should be good to go.  DF

I have tried to incorporate comments from our meeting last Thursday as well 
as written comments provided to me.  There are still some areas that we need 
to decide on.  For example, we need to determine if arbitrage argument works 
and finalize related Exhibits.  Also, re:  daily imbalance pricing at points 
that have EFM, are we keeping the 25,000 Dth??  Also, I'm not sure whether we 
confirmed that we have only called one Alert Day since 1994.  Finally, we 
need to double check the tariff language on autobalancing per note on page 29 
of draft.  Please review and provide me with comments early on Monday.  
Thanks.  Maria

Rod, I have an e mail stating that TBG has found sufficient funds for the 
bridge financing associated wither E&C activities of the three compressors 
stations and that Pete Weidler has agreed to allow E&C to roll the cost of 
equipment (compression) into the EPC price. 
The compression is to be ordered by ETS on the behalf of GTB.  My question is 
which ETS company will the equipment be ordered through?  GTB has made 
reference of EAMR in the LOI signed with Solar but I question that statement.

I could see accruing $100,000 for legal fees on the ONeOk arbitration--which 
will be concluded in May.  We could also reserve against OneOk's 
counterclaim--which is about $4 million.  We expect a final arbitration 
decision 15 days after close of the hearing which should be well within the 
2d quarter.  We may decide to use post-hearing briefs, however, which might 
push the decision into the third quarter.  Let me know if either of these is 
worth pursuing.  DF

Subject: First Quarter Forecast - March Actuals
Importance: High

We reviewed the forecast with Stan this afternoon, and Stan requested that we 
do everything possible to accrue as much expense in March as we can (to the 
benefit of 2nd and 3rd quarters).  I recommend that you focus on larger 
amounts.


Please send your projections to Vera as soon as possible.

Lou,  Are there any environmental or PCB reimbursements that we could 
legitimately accrue in March?

Thanks for your help!

Subject: First Quarter Forecast

 	


It appears today that ETS will end the first Quarter with at least $25 
Million additional dollars due to improved Revenue Margins.   This assumes 
that Operations will end the Quarter Flat with Plan.   If we end up under 
Plan, then it adds to this amount, and of course if we end up over it 
subtracts.

It is imperative that we provide to Vera an accurate projection of where we 
will end this quarter, asap, but no later than Thursday of this week.

Our preference would be to push as much of this $25 million into the second 
or third quarter.

We should make every effort to project our spending for March, compare our 
actuals to plan for January and February and provide Vera this projection.

We should also look to the outer quarters to see if we know of any major 
payments we have to make during these quarters and accrue for them.   We 
should also get with all our AP clerks and make sure that we have paid all 
the bills we possibly can before the end of this week, including working 
Saturday, if we have to.

Shirley Jo - please make sure that we have properly received everything 
through the system that can be properly accounted for.

Thanks,

mb

As of September 29th if you have not converted from the "old" ras dial-up 
connection to ipass you will no longer be able to dial into Enron from your 
laptop. This will not effect those that dial in with their "home" computer. I 
need your laptop and the following information,,, RC#, last four numbers of 
your SS, and the company number. The process takes about one hour to load the 
software and test the dial-up connection. We need your info now so we can get 
the account setup, so that when you bring your laptop to me all I have to do 
is load the software and test. Have a great weekend......Steve Welch...

Interesting.  I remember vaguely that we had some concern with how VAR was 
calculated.  I recall that Dave Neubauer didn't think that we were doing it 
right for TW.  Do you remember this issue?  If so, does this change address 
the same issue?  Also, I'll line up a meeting today or tomorrow on  the TW 
options filing in general, and we can discuss the customer meeting and also 
touch on this internal controls issue.  Thanks  DF

Please Note:

The Corporate Risk Management Department prepares ET&S's Value at Risk 
calculation.  They recently completed a review of our historical experience 
and correlation on our hedged positions.  Based on this review, we have 
agreed to increase the correlation to .90.  This change has caused the V@R to 
decrease significantly to more appropriately reflect the risk in our 
positions.  We will continue to work with Risk Management to assure that our 
exposures are being appropriately reflected in the V@R calculation.

If there are any question regarding the V@R calculation, please contact Dan 
Fancler or Bob Chandler.

Thanks for your comments below. 

We consulted our AA folks in drafting the disclosures.  It wasn't a big deal 
for Enron's 10Q because the positions between NNG and TW are eliminated in 
the consolidated statements.  As for the Form 2 and the Brown Covers, there 
are specific GAAP disclosure requirements that we have to include on a 
stand-alone basis.  Since most of these positions will be gone by year end, 
it won't look nearly as massive as it was at the end of the third quarter.  
In fact, if Roger Willard had given us his final word about the transactions 
in time, we would have booked the ultimate net transactions in September and 
we wouldn't have had all these gross positions.  I don't feel quite as bad 
about not getting it right in the unaudited third quarter financials as I 
otherwise would, since we did review the transactions and the noteholders 
disclosures with AA before the 3rd quarter was released and before the 
noteholders reports were distributed.  

As always, Legal and Regulatory will have ample opportunity to comment on 
Brown Cover and Form 2 disclosures before they are finalized.

Subject: Quarterly Noteholder Reports

I've reviewed the draft NN and TW quarterly reports to noteholders.  I 
haven't had a chance to compare these to prior quarterly filings, but I have 
three questions/concerns.  First, the discussions of "Price Risk Management 
Activities" seem overly detailed and cumbersome given the true commercial 
impact of the deals involved.  For example, we disclose the total notional 
amount of gas involved in the Transcanada deal, the "fair value" of the 
trades, and a variety of  other details, even the total economic impact of 
the deal to us is pretty small (about a million dollars if I remember 
right).  The base gas deal, by comparison, was discussed in one sentence.  
Can we avoid making the thing look bigger than it really is by disclosing 
something more meaningful like VAR (which I assume would be a much smaller 
number)?  Second, disclosing TW and NN trading activity separately makes the 
Transcanada deal look like a bigger thing than it really was, since the TW 
and NN portions offset one another.  I know we need to disclose deals 
separately for each operating company, but is there a way things like 
notional value and "fair value" (or VAR) can be aggregated to more accurately 
reflect the total impact of the deal--currently it looks like both TW and NN 
were out doing huge commodity deals.  Third, I have never been that concerned 
about overly broad disclosures in the noteholder reports because of the 
limited distribution.   However, if these disclosures will be Arthur 
Anderson's template for the Enron Corp. 10Q or the FERC Form 2s, I have a 
real problem.  

Please let me know if I can be of help in talking through these issues.  DF

I met with Ms Caplan yesterday and had a good discussion.  I was pretty 
impressed with her.  The only down side is that her inability to sit for the 
Texas bar is a hangup for a lawyer position.   I suggested that she also look 
into getting her license in New York or D.C. as I think those jurisdictions 
are less reluctant to allow non-U.S. lawyers to sit for the bar than Texas 
is.  I'll talk to Mike Moran, Dot McCoppin, Britt Davis and Shelley Corman 
regaring possible positions in GPG.  Have you thought about Steve Kean's 
group?  They might be able to use someone like Emma.  I plan to write her in 
a couple of weeks to follow up with any additional leads I've found.  Enjoyed 
shootin the shit with you, as always!  DF

I don't see any serious problems with this.  There are a few things you two 
need to verify or get comfortable with:  bullet 6 says PG&E has made all 
payments in a timely manner.  You can leave it in if its true, but the bullet 
needs to be mutual, not one-way, and I'd suggest replacing it with: 
"Transwestern and PG&E agree that, by entering into this agreement, neither 
is to be deemed to have made any admission against interest."  Also, the 
mechanism in bullet 9 is up to you, Paul.  We should probably list the rating 
service by name to avoid ambiguity.  There are also a couple of minor 
things:  in bullet 2, add an "s" to "contract" inline 2; in bullet 7, add 
"the" at the end of line 1.  Call if you have questions.  DF

Europe May Need 69,000 MW by 2005; What Generation Mix Will the Continent
Use to Reach that Goal?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five
years may prompt the need for an additional 69,000 MW of generating capacity
to be built, according to a new report from Financial Times Energy. The
additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through 2004,
but also includes Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
At the same time, concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being
exacerbated by Germany's plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power.

ANALYSIS: If FT Energy's projections for necessary generation additions
in Europe are accurate, I think there are some real challenges that the
Continent will face in reaching this goal. First off, for perspective,
let's be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming
Europe will need by 2005. The figure of 69,000 MW is roughly equivalent
to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system
in Texas. When we consider also that the United States consumes about double
the amount of power that Europe consumes, the projection that Europe will
need an additional 69,000 MW of new generating capacity is a staggering
proposition.

Granted, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's energy consumption
has grown over the last two years. According to data included in its report,
FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from 2,409 
terrawatt-hours
(TWh) in 1998 to 2,446 TWh in 1999, an increase of about 1.5 percent per
year. While this may seem like a minimal increase, it is important to note
that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average. For instance,
estimated new capacity additions through 2005 are mainly concentrated in
Spain, France, Germany and Sweden. The growth in demand, coupled with market
liberalization, has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction
or purchase of generation assets.

Although reportedly 60 percent of the electricity market across Europe
has been liberalized to date, the Continent remains rather disjointed as
it is composed of 16 national markets that are all approaching privatization
at different speeds. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their
privatization movements in the early 1990s. Spain required its state-owned
utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February 1999, a process
that will continue through 2007. Germany decided to open 100 percent of
its market all at once in April 1998. And France resisted efforts to 
privatize,
and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European
Union. Consequently, although Europe may in fact need the 69,000 MW of
new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected, the type and extent
to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on
the energy policy of each independent nation. A variety of restrictions
may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount
of capacity.

Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization
and, by extension, its approach to generation development. I can't examine
the policy of each country in this forum, but I think a look at Germany
is warranted, both because it is a major component of Europe's total energy
market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact
the Continent as a whole.

Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation,
due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened
to competition. It follows that generation coming from Germany should 
contribute
a large percentage of the Continent's future power needs. However, a large
percentage of Germany's power has come from nuclear power, but that has
all changed over the last year. After the Social Democratic Party formed
a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party, nuclear energy became an
unacceptable energy source. The German government has essentially put a
moratorium on nuclear power, and in fact decided to eventually shut down
19 nuclear power plants in the country. Just last month, Germany's two
largest power producers, RWE AG and E.ON AG, announced plans to cut output
from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has
developed since Germany liberalized its market. The measures amount to
a reduction of about 10 percent in Germany's overall power generating 
capacity.


Moreover, nuclear energy has generated over one-third of Germany's nearly
500 billion kilowatt-hours of annual electricity demand, and one-third
of Western Europe's total electricity supply. As the future of nuclear
power in Germany looks rather dim, big questions surround what will replace
nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europe's
energy industry.

Coal currently produces about 50 percent of the power generation in Germany,
but as a result of the country's attempts to lower emissions, coal also
appears to be on a decline. Also, in Germany, as in the rest of Europe,
coal-industry subsidies will come to an end as early as 2005, making it
less economical to invest in coal-fired plants. At the same time, other
countries like France are exploring clean-coal technologies, but it is
questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand
across the Continent.

Generally, natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will
take the place of nuclear power in Europe, given the seemingly abundant
supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea. However, as demand
across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases, this may
impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe. In addition, there
are no effective rules across Europe for third-party access to private
pipeline grids, also putting into question the future of natural-gas supplies.
Also, as we have seen in the United States, as demand for natural gas 
increases,
so will the prices, which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary
power source.

As a result, much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable
energy. In fact, the German government wants to double renewable energy
output to 10 percent of total energy demand by 2010, using such forms as
hydroelectric and wind power. This seems consistent with what the rest
of Europe is doing. The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate
10 percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2010. Scandinavian
countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and 
low-emission
forms of energy, with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of
the Nordic region's total electricity production.

Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western
Europe, with projects in Germany, Denmark and Spain ranking among the 
fastest-growing
in the world. Again, according to the U.S. DOE, wind power is projected
to grow by 1.9 percent per year in Western Europe. This growth prospective
is pretty dismal, and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will
be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe. Renewable energy works fine
when planning overall energy needs, but it rarely can be relied on to meet
peak demand. The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to
and the sun shines when it wants to, which can make peak planning based
on renewable energy difficult if not impossible. This being the case, many
critics say Europe's current move toward renewable energy is completely
unrealistic, arguing that it would take nearly 2,000 wind turbines to equal
one nuclear plant. In addition, the growth for renewable energy is plotted
over the course of ten to fifteen years. FT Energy marks the year 2005
as the point at which Europe will need the additional 69,000 MW of generating
capacity.

In addition, despite the fact that coal-fired generation poses pollution
problems, it is still a comparatively low-cost form of generation. This
will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence
of a strong worldwide commitment. The U.S. Department of Energy projects
only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of
energy through 2020, just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain
a slim 8-percent share of the total world energy consumption.

So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for
new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources
that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs? First, keep in
mind that I've focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role
in Europe as a whole. However, the restrictions on nuclear power are not
necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries. For
instance, the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by
opening a plant in Temelin. The question is, without Germany's contribution
of nuclear power, will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other
power sources and other countries? Although the 69,000 MW goal seems very
ambitious, Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use
of merchant plants. As competition continues, wholesale power buyers are
demanding shorter-term contracts, which in turn is supporting a growing
trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent. Presently, only
the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power, but there
are signs that the trend is extending to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
and even Germany. In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear
power, merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europe's
natural-gas market. Yet, as we have seen in California, the plant siting
process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles, and it is not clear
if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries.
Plus, the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily 
natural-gas
fired, which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source.

Moreover, just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter
due to our own brand of energy supply problems, we are finding that the
problem is not limited to our part of the world. It is, of course, unknown
if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of 69,000 MW by 2005.
Yet, at the same time, it is clear that demand on the Continent continues
to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline.

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =

Subject: ECS Gallup contract

Here are some bullet points based on our conversation Friday morning 
regarding the ECS Compression Service Agreement.  These bullet points 
summarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a 
conversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined) 
regarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of 
the lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have 
additional comments, please let me know.  

We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that 
up to you, but do let me know if I can help. 

-  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a 
monitoring system that would automatically 
alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  

-  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission 
for TW to access the "Members Only" portion of CDEC's website (which contains 
load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a 
confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.

-  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on 
the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   "Good faith" 
by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any 
difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted 
in this regard.  

-  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load 
times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers 
with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this, 
but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have 
access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.

-  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July 
could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it 
did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information 
from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should 
therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.

-  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring 
system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the 
website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.

I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of 
the website; I'll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted 
"on a case-by-case basis."  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you 
know what I'm able to learn from them.

In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list 
of Transwestern's "major" shippers to California with contact names and phone 
numbers.  I've defined "major" as anyone with total firm contracts of 
25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Thanks,
Lindy

Is the difference between the first two cases and the second two cases the 
higher 775 lb suction pressure that we hope we could get from pigging the 
line?  If so, does this email say anything about whether we could get 
10,000mmbtu/d to the Cal. border assuming the pigging successfully gets us to 
775 lbs?  Lets talk to McShane tomorrow.  Thanks.. DF

Subject: Gallup Horsepower

The following is information requested by Terry Galassini:

Operating Points 1A and 1B have a 750 Psig line inlet pressure and differ 
only in gas suction temperature, 75 Degrees F for 1A and 80 Degrees F for 
1B.  Both conditions can operate with the current wheel at Gallup; however, 
Rolls would have to agree to a faster spin of the current compressor wheel as 
explained in the cases.  Without approval from Rolls, a new aero, $125,000, 
would be required.The motor horsepower is the crital component.  Mr 
Eisenstein will have to comment on motor capability.
 
Operating Point #1A

750 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
75 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume

Head = 12,442 Feet
Acfm = 10,827 Actual Ft3/Min?Gas Horsepower Required = 12,300 @ 80% (Required Power to Motor = 13,369 ?Hp/9,970 KW *)?Gas Horsepower Required = 12,456 @ 79% (Required Power to Motor = 13,539 ?Hp/10,100 KW *)?* Represents an 8% total motor, gearbox and compressor bearing losses.??Two options exist for this case.??The first is to increase the compressor wheel speed from its current maximum ?continuous 9,450 Rpm speed to 9,922 Rpm (+5%).  The wheel was shop tested to ?10,868 Rpm (+15%).  Rolls would have to advise the warranty and saftey ?considerations.  If agreed to by Rolls, the current wheel would need to ?operate at the following conditions to meet the above head and Acfm:??Compressor Speed = 9,625 Rpm (Approximate)?Motor Speed = 1,528 Rpm (Can the above horsepowers into the motor be acheived ?at this speed, Arnold????) ?Inlet velocity to compressor = 102.11 Ft3/Sec
Maximum Design is 120 Ft/Sec
Gallup Test Had 4 Points at or Above 102 Ft/Sec w/No vibration or Noise 
Problems.

The second is to purchase a new aero assembly, $125,000 and 20 - 24 weeks 
lead time.  A new aero would probably spin a little slower than the 9,625 Rpm 
suggested above.  This would put more emphasis on motor horsepower at a speed 
less than 1,528 as calculated above.  Again, Mr. Eisenstein would have to 
comment on motor capability.


Operating Point #1B

750 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
80 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume

Head = 12,604 Feet
Acfm = 10,968 Actual Ft3/Min?Gas Horsepower Required = 12,460 @ 80% (Required Power to Motor = 13,544 ?Hp/10,099 KW *)?Gas Horsepower Required = 12,617 @ 79% (Required Power to Motor = 13,715 ?Hp/10,228 KW *)?* Represents an 8% total motor, gearbox and compressor bearing losses.??Two options exist for this case.??The first is to increase the compressor wheel speed from its current maximum ?continuous 9,450 Rpm speed to 9,922 Rpm (+5%).

If agreed to by Rolls, the current wheel would need to ?operate at the following conditions to meet the above head and Acfm:??Compressor Speed = 9,675 Rpm (Approximate)?Motor Speed = 1,536 Rpm (Can the above horsepowers into the motor be acheived ?at this speed, Arnold????) ?Inlet velocity to compressor = 103.45 Ft3/Sec
Maximum Design is 120 Ft/Sec
Gallup Test Had 4 Points at or Above 103 Ft/Sec w/No vibration or Noise 
Problems.

The second is to purchase a new aero assembly, $125,000 and 20 - 24 weeks 
lead time.  A new aero would probably spin a little slower than the 9,675 Rpm 
suggested above.  This would put more emphasis on motor horsepower at a speed 
less than 1,536 as calculated above.  Mr. Eisenstein would have to comment on 
motor capability.


Operating Points 2A and 2B have a 775 Psig line inlet pressure and differ 
only in gas suction temperature, 75 Degrees F for 2A and 80 Degrees F for 
2B.  Both conditions can operate with the current wheel at Gallup at the 
current speed limit.  Whether or not the current motor at the site is capable 
of meeting the 2A and 2B conditions without modifications is left up to Mr. 
Eisenstein.  

Operating Point #2A

775 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
75 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume

Head = 10,841 Feet
Acfm = 10,451 Actual Ft3/Min?Gas Horsepower Required = 10,718 @ 80% (Required Power to Motor = 11,650 ?Hp/8,688 KW *)??* Represents an 8% total motor, gearbox and compressor bearing losses.??Based on test results at Gallup, the compressor speed will be approximately ?8,900 Rpm, well within its current capability.  The current wheel would ?operate at the following conditions to meet the above head and Acfm:??Compressor Speed = 8,900 Rpm (Approximate)?Motor Speed = 1,413 Rpm (Can the above horsepowers into the motor be acheived ?at this speed, Arnold????) ?Inlet velocity to compressor = 98.57 Ft3/Sec
Maximum Design is 120 Ft/Sec
Gallup Test Had 4 Points at or Above 99 Ft/Sec w/No vibration or Noise 
Problems.


Operating Point #2B

775 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
80 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume

Head = 10,984 Feet
Acfm = 10,590 Actual Ft3/Min?Gas Horsepower Required = 10,858 @ 80% (Required Power to Motor = 11,803 ?Hp/8,802 KW *)??* Represents an 8% total motor, gearbox and compressor bearing losses.??Based on test results at Gallup, the compressor speed will be approximately ?8,960 Rpm, well within its current capability.

Looks OK to me.  Are you sure the SW Gas point is a primary point for some of 
the Gallup shippers?  I didn't remember that.  If others are ok also, go for 
it.  Thanks. df

We're told top aides at the Bush campaign headquarters in Austin were
in hysterics upon hearing that network television is developing a
Texas version of "Survivor," the popular TV show.

Contestants must travel from Amarillo through Fort Worth, Dallas,
Houston, San Antonio, and back to Amarillo, through San Marcos and
Lubbock, driving a Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads: "I'm for
Gore, I'm Gay and I'm Here to Take Your Guns."
If anybody finishes, they win.

  Drew J. Fossum
  Counsel
  Enron Corp.

Dear  Mr. Fossum:

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to LRSolutions.  It is 
our mission to provide corporate in-house counsel with all the tools and 
resources necessary to excel in every area of legal practice - preventative 
law, new product development and new markets, litigation support, 
transactional work, and regulatory compliance, among others.  At LRSolutions, 
we are able to meet this challenge through the provision of expert legal 
knowledge at reasonable, fixed prices.

As you are well aware, legal research and related "knowledge" activities and 
products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise.  
(if you would like to see our website it is http://www.lrsolutions.com.  
Click on any of the links on the lefthand side of the screen for detailed 
descriptions).  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of 
"reinventing the wheel", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  
Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing 
inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to 
the enormous costs for corporate counsel.

However, LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and 
quality.  Our network of legal experts includes hundreds of the nation's 
premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized 
intuitively into areas of specialty.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/network.html.  In addition, our Board of Advisers 
includes the former Chief Counsel for Cigna Corporation, the former Associate 
General Counsel from Proctor and Gamble, and a partner from a large 
Washington D.C. law firm.

Experienced, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related 
projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.  Our products 
and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research 
memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials 
such as appellate briefs and court filings, and listings of relevant 
authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and 
objective that best suits your needs.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/expert.html.

We also are in the early stages of developing essential online compliance 
education training for corporate employees.  As you know, compliance training 
is essential if corporations are to avoid damaging liability.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/online.html.  Federal sentencing guidelines and 
courts often reduce or eliminate liabiity for companies with effective 
programs.  We are looking for corporations that are interested in forming 
strategic alliances with LRSolutions regarding production of these courses.  
Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com/strategic.html.

I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting at your corporate 
headquarters to discuss LRSolutions further.  If you would like to contact me 
by phone, or would like to receive a brochure, please feel free to call at 
1-800-627-8047.  Please also feel free to reply via email as well.  I am 
convinced that LRSolutions will be a critical and welcome long-term resource 
for your legal department and greatly look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely Yours

Ray Nussbaum, Esq.
CEO, President
LRSolutions, Inc.

EEI's State Restructuring Service Web Site was just launched last month and 
recorded over 11,000 hits in October.  We think that if you are at all 
interested in what's going in restructuring states in response to 
California's ongoing demand/supply imbalance, market problems in several 
other states, you would be interested in EEI's new Web site.

The State Restructuring Service includes:

o  News and analyses of noteworthy legislative, regulatory and judicial 
decisions as they occur
o  Implementation decisions in restructuring states
o  Noteworthy restructuring-related actions in other states, even if not of 
comprehensive scope
o  E-mail notification of all noteworthy restructuring and related actions
o  E-mails are posted to the Web site's Action Alerts section within 24 hours
o  Site's Action Alerts are browsable and fully searchable
o  Hyperlinks to all Web posted source documents are provided
o  Policy overviews and analyses of all comprehensive restructuring laws and 
regulatory decisions

The service includes e-mail notification of breaking restructuring actions, 
as well as full access to the Web site.  For those who just need a heads up 
about noteworthy state policy actions, the e-mail service is available as a 
separate stand-alone service (free to members) or for half the price of the 
full Web service.  We cover all aspects of restructuring the electric utility 
industry and the implementation of retail electricity competition at the 
state level from the comprehensive laws, to regulatory and judicial decisions.

Availability --------------------------->

The Web site is available to EEI members (free of charge) and to anyone else 
for a fee at:
http://www.eei.org/7online/online/srs/

Please see the attached MS Rich Text Format file with more information about 
how members can get an ID/Password, as well as the pricing and subscription 
process for EEI Associate members and non-member organizations.

Please feel free to forward this e-mail (with attachment) to anyone you think 
might be interested in staying informed of state restructuring policy 
developments and researching existing state policies.

EEI member utilities wishing to have access should contact Lynn Hailes at: 
lhailes@eei.org or 202/508-5624.

Shelley, these comments look good.  I think they properly set forth  a 
structure to provide for these items as the entire market develops not prior 
to the service availability.  Most importantly, GISB isn't the business 
driver-  others please comment.   Remember,we aren't against its a 
timing/complete evaluation of the impacts to other service that hasn't been 
dealt with.  MK

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. 
Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)
has been the only pipeline into this market.  


NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 
47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored 
by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will 
add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis 
market. 

"The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing 
strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets 
currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by 
adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network," said Richard D. 
Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. 

The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is 
scheduled for completion in June of 2002. 

NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and 
storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, 
which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In 
addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation 
agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf 
Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. 

The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area 
that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company 
[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, 
president of Illinois Power. "This new connection to Illinois Power's system 
will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the 
metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point 
to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the 
area. 

"The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy 
provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project," said Deb 
Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest 
from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season 
will determine the final scope of the project. 

"With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the 
St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of 
interest," said Macdonald. "We anticipate a strong response, however, given 
the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
generation." 

Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business 
development, at (630) 691-3347.

Yes, they specifically wanted "contacts and phone numbers for our major 
shippers".  (Steve January, please correct me if I'm wrong.)  Steve is the 
person who received the call/request from FERC.  Steve, maybe you could 
elaborate for Mary Kay and Drew on the information the FERC has been 
requesting from you (you've discussed with Shelley?) having to do with flows 
to CA, any upcoming outages/maintenance, etc.

Not having received the request,  it seems like the quantity related to the

directly with Drew as I'll be out.   MK

Subject: FERC Request

In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list 
of Transwestern's "major" shippers to California with contact names and phone 
numbers.  I've defined "major" as anyone with total firm contracts of 
25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Thanks,
Lindy

I'm sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of 
activity lately related to Enron's evaluation of possible acquisitions.  John 
Goodpasture's group has kept a large number of ET&S people engaged in looking 
at a number of potential deals.  While these deal evaluation projects have 
become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are 
extremely confidential.  Even after a potential seller has announced that it 
is up for sale, the fact that Enron is looking at a potential deal, as well 
as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential.  

I realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees 
of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the 
future.  If you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at 
the target company asks whether Enron is evaluating the contact's company or 
assets, the only appropriate response is that Enron personnel are not 
permitted to discuss potential acquisitions.  Please be aware that the 
confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition 
evaluation process preclude any communication by Enron people with employees 
of the target company.  

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do 
not hesitate to give me a call.  Thank you for your assistance.  DF

Subject: Monthly Report on SLA Activity

Attached please find the February 2001 report showing current month activity 
in the System Levelized Account (SLA).  Information for this report comes 
from data provided by Gas Accounting Department.  Several items to note for 
this, the first distribution:
All non-shaded information on this report reflects the same data as shown on 
Exhibit No. 7 which has been provided to Northern's shippers in conjunction 
with Docket No. RP01-76-000 data requests.  (Only January data has been given 
to the shippers at this time.)
Columns (j) and (k) serve to highlight the segregation of the SLA account 
into its two components - cash and future liability.  The two columns add 
together to equal the total amount of the SLA account on the books (Column 
(i)). 
Column (j) reflects the cash portion of the SLA account, i.e. the actual 
amount of cash spent/(received) in maintaining Northern's operational storage.
Column (k) reflects the future liability portion of the SLA account, i.e. the 
future amount of cash to be spent/(received) in clearing the Dollar Valued 
Volume short/(long) position.  It is computed by multiplying the month-end 
Dollar Valued Volume short/(long) position by the respective month's MIP. 

This file contains both the January and February report.  To print each 
month's report, simply click on the respective tab.

Call me with any questions.

Subject: Risk System Alternatives Next Steps

Lee,
Just to recap the meeting with Richard Burchfield and Steve Stock, based on 
the requirements that you and Vernon have identified, we would need to use 
several of the system components including TAG, ERMS, GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, 
CREDIT, and UNIFY for settlements.  All of these applications are tightly 
integrated.  We considered moving them into the ETS environment which would 
separate the applications, but this would be a very large undertaking and 
would be a resource intensive effort.  Therefore, due to the size, complexity 
and integration of the applications, the group came to the conclusion that it 
would be more timely and cost effective from an inception as well as 
maintenance standpoint that ETS would have to share these systems with the 
marketing group, and that porting them to the ETS environment as separate 
application images would not be good from an overall migration as well as 
support standpoint.  Additionally, we considered the EnPower System which is 
also integrated into GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, CREDIT and UNIFY.  We are planning 
on a demo Friday morning, but there may be some functionality that you all 
are looking for related to gas that EnPower cannot provide at this time and 
would require some customization.  We'll know more tomorrow after the demo.

Regarding security, these applications are secured to segregate the data, but 
we need an approval from Legal that it would be ok to use shared resources 
from the IT standpoint.  This would include application developers and 
database administrators.  Additionally, we would have to go through the 
process of verifying that there would be no security leaks where it would be 
possible for a marketer to run a report on pipeline related data, etc...  If 
we can get an ok from Legal regardinig sharing of resources, then one of 
these options can be explored further, but if we cannot get approval on 
sharing of resources, it doesn't look like porting either of these 
applications into the ETS environment as standalone apps would be the most 
timely or cost effective way to go at this time.  Can you get a stand from 
Legal regarding this issue?  Thanks.

I'd be happy to give you some specific feedback on this project.  I think you 
did a good job of bringing some focus to a project that badly needed focus.  
I was particularly pleased with how you vectored off from what started out as 
a computer system enhancement project and instead you brought home a solution 
that allows us to improve things immediately with manual processes and then 
upgrade to a system if we choose.  You showed a lot of creativity and 
flexibility in adapting to the changing project focus.  I really valued your 
thoroughness in getting input from all interested parties.  Your legwork up 
front made it a lot easier to get needed buy-in when we finally brought 
management in.  The product was timely and I expect it to deliver on my 
expectations, although the implementation will be the key.  Thanks again for 
the good work, and expect me to be a frequent customer.  DF

Subject: Feedback on Document Controls Investigation Project

Now that the investigation of documents has been completed and a general plan 
of action has been agreed upon by the various departments involved, the 
Document Controls Investigation Project has drawn to a close.  As I have 
indicated to Contract Administration, I am available to assist them as they 
deem necessary in further detailing and implementing the new enhancements to 
the contracts process.

At the close of a project, it is always good to gain feedback from the 
project sponsors and look for ways that Business Consulting/Business Services 
can be even more effective within the ET&S organization.  With this purpose 
in mind, Drew and Julia, would you be willing to send your comments to myself 
and/or Mike McGowan on the following:

Did the end result of the project meet your expectations?
Did the end result meet the objectives outlined in the project scope?
Were you able to accomplish what you intended as a sponsor of the project?
Was the project delivered in a timely manner?
Any other comments that might be valuable for leadership or participation in 
future projects by Business Consulting/Business Services?

Sorry, I forgot to answer your last question.  I think its fine to send the 
documents out to Hanover.  Even if some of the blanks are not filled in, we 
can get their lawyers looking at the structure.  DF

Drew - Do I need some kind of confidentiality agreement? An attorney present 
to discuss at first meeting?

MKM - One questions Jim Gill had was how do we get around FERC requirements - 
someone from Regulatory available to discuss at first meeting or.....?

Although we believe the operating agreement and other details are in order, I 
hadn't just planned to send them as is to Hanover. Some counseling may be in 
order here, as I'm moving into new territory for me......

Mike,

Talked to Jim Gill at 4:30 pm.  They are very interested.  He proposed the 
following steps:

1)  Send him an equipment list.  I think the Description and Location 
Schedule 1.1 from the P&S Agreement would more than suffice.

2)  He would like to visit the stations with the Hanover V.P. of Operations 
and one other person.  (He indicated 3 total.)  A quasi due diligence look at 
the condition of the facilities.  He would like access to records etc. during 
his visit.

3)  We could set down and talk "financials" after that.

He did not seemed surprised that I did not have good station plot plans to 
supplement the equipment list.  I will get a package together tomorrow.  
[Forgot to get his address. dah!]

I conjectured that you would want to discuss this with him further tomorrow.  
He said he would be in all day.

Charlie

Subject: Enron Tag Line Change

Dear Enron Employees:

 With the addition of communications to our core businesses, it is 
appropriate for us to modify our existing tag line to simply "Endless 
possibilities."  This change is effective immediately and replaces our 
current tag line of "Natural gas. Electricity. Endless possibilities."

 To achieve our goal of a unified Enron brand, each employee has the 
responsibility to make the Enron image a consistent and strong identity.  
This is partially accomplished through correct application of the logo and 
tag line.  A revised Corporate Identity Guidelines Book has been developed to 
assist you in following the correct standards.  You may obain a copy of this 
new book by completing a Forms Request and ordering Item #42629.    These 
guidelines will also be made available electronically on the Brand Site at 
home.enron.com.

 We'd like to take this opportunity to remind all of you about the importance 
of maintaining a consistent look, especially with our stationery and business 
cards.  It has come to our attention recently that some employees are having 
these items produced by outside vendors and are not following the established 
guidelines.  This must stop immediately.  Please use the internal resources 
available to you for these items.  They will ensure that all guidelines are 
followed correctly and consistently.  If you have questions on how to get 
these items or on the guidelines, you may contact Marge Nadasky in Corporate 
Identity at marge.nadasky@enron.com.

 One name, one company....one Enron.  Our recent reorganization brings us 
another step closer to realizing this goal.  Please make sure you do your 
part to protect and strengthen the Enron brand around the world.

 Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.


      Office of the Chairman

Bill, attached is a memo prepared by Susan Scott that does a good job of 
answering the several questions that you had about the situation at Topock.  
Note that in Susan's first answer, PG&E has no obligation to Transwestern to 
accept gas at Topock.  They may well have obligations to their own 
transportation customers or sales customers that have to be satisfied with 
Topock receipts, but that doesn't give TW any rights against PG&E.  I realize 
these are not comforting answers, but I wanted us all to have a realistic 
understanding of where we are.  I'm running this by Lou in case he has a 
different spin on the history or the agreements.  Thanks. DF

Dynegy and NRG Energy to Purchase Sierra Pacific Assets
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Dynegy (NYSE: DYN) and NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG) announced a major expansion
of their co-owned generation portfolio in the West through asset purchase
agreements to acquire 1,330 MW of power generation facilities from Sierra
Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).  The facilities include the 740 MW gas-fired
Clark Generating Station and 590 MW of the 605 MW, coal-fired Reid Gardner
Generating Station. The facilities are currently owned by Sierra Pacific
Resources' subsidiary, Nevada Power Company, and serve the growing Las
Vegas market.

ANALYSIS: This $634 million purchase has resulted from regulatory mandates
surrounding the Sierra Pacific-Nevada Power merger, which was completed
in July 1999. Sierra Pacific is undergoing the sale and transfer of all
of its remaining gas, oil and natural-gas fired Nevada generating assets,
which it intends to complete in 2001.

The Reid Gardner and Clark Stations are among the seven asset bundles that
were included in an auction by Sierra Pacific earlier this year. Located
in southeastern Las Vegas, the Clark Generating Station consists of 10
gas- and oil-fired generating units, which as noted total 740 MW. The oldes=
t
unit at the Clark Generating Station became operational in 1955, the newest
in 1994. Specific information about which units at the Clark Generating
Station are included in this purchase was not available. The Reid Gardner
Generating Station consists of four baseload coal-fired units and is locate=
d
52 miles northeast of Las Vegas. According to recent data from the Energy
Information Administration, the California Department of Water Resources
owns about 68 percent of the Reid Gardner Plant. It is not clear what impac=
t
the Dynegy / NRG purchase will have on this organization's ownership in
the plant.

The purchase of the Sierra Pacific assets is subject to approval from the
Federal Trade Commission, FERC and the Nevada Public Utilities Commission,
and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2001. Additional
conditions of the deal include a power purchase agreement for Nevada Power
to buy energy and ancillary services from Dynegy and NRG "at a stable price=
"
until March 2003.

On their own, both companies are leaders in independent power production
and energy supply. Yet this acquisition is the latest in a string of=20
collaborative
efforts between Dynegy and NRG. Together, the companies have been actively
acquiring power plants in Illinois and the West Coast, along with purchases
that they have made independently. In fact, this purchase of assets from
Sierra Pacific marks the sixth asset alliance between Dynegy and NRG.=20
Together,
the two companies jointly own 2,768 MW of power generation facilities in
California and 350 MW in Illinois. In most of the partnerships, and in
the case of this latest purchase from Sierra Pacific, Dynegy markets the
energy produced at the plants and oversees fuel management services, while
NRG manages the operational side.

Last July, Dynegy and NRG entered into a similar agreement to expand the
Rocky Road Power Plant, a natural gas-fired, simple cycle peaking facility
in East Dundee, Illinois. The move into Illinois was an important strategy
for both companies. Of course, Dynegy completed its merger with Illinova
last summer, creating a $22 billion company that is well-positioned to
compete in electric generation, wholesale and retail marketing, and gas
and electric power trading. At the time, the CEO of NRG Energy made it
clear that the Rocky Road plant expansion was part of the two companies'
strategy in becoming a large contributor to the Chicago-area energy market.
Dynegy, in fact, intends to continue acquiring and expanding generation
facilities in Illinois so that it can compete with Exelon Corp.

Moreover, both companies are positioning themselves to be leaders in=20
generation
capacity and power supply, and the purchase of the 1,330 MW from Sierra
Pacific factors in to both of their strategies. Not only does the acquisiti=
on
help to expand both companies' asset base, but it also diversifies their
power supply offerings. For instance, NRG claims that the assets complement
its current gas-fired peaking and intermediate California assets, providing
the benefits of fuel and dispatch level diversification. NRG aims to build
a "top three position in its primary markets." The acquisition of assets
from Sierra Pacific puts NRG into a prime position in the fast-growing
Nevada and Western markets by adding a strong component of baseload generat=
ion
to its portfolio.

In fact, this is the second acquisition that NRG has made from Sierra Pacif=
ic.
Just last month, NRG announced its intent to purchase a 50-percent interest
in the Valmy Power Station, which Sierra Pacific is selling also as a resul=
t
of regulatory mandates. The Valmy Power Station, which is primarily=20
coal-fired,
produces electricity in the northern Nevada and surrounding markets. In
this $273 million deal, NRG acted as an independent buyer.

Dynegy has long claimed that it wants to gain a 10-percent share, or 70,000
MW, of the U.S. electric market over the next five year by acquiring plants=
,
building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others.
In order to reach this goal, I had projected last summer that Dynegy might
be looking to merge with another provider to build its scale, considering
the fierce competition it faces from other generation companies. The compan=
y
has now taken a different path to achieve essentially the same result.
The addition of Sierra Pacific's facilities, combined with other assets
that the company has acquired or developed this year, increases Dynegy's
generating capacity by more than 4,000 gross megawatts. Dynegy contends
that this figure is comparable to many industry mergers without the regulat=
ed
transmission and distribution businesses. Dynegy also believes the acquisit=
ion
will support a raise in its earnings forecast for 2001, from $1.75 to $1.80
per share.

Dynegy's goals are pretty ambitious. However, the company has been increasi=
ng
earnings over the last year, so the $1.80 per share target may be attainabl=
e.
For 3Q 2000, Dynegy reported recurring net income of $176.5 million, or
55 cents a share, compared with Dynegy / Illinova pro forma recurring net
income of $96.5 million, or 32 cents per share, for the same period last
year. Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade, whose
reported net income increased to $141.9 million=01*80 percent of the compan=
y's
consolidated net income. There is little doubt that Dynegy and NRG,=20
considering
that they own 2,768 MW of power in the state, benefited from the short
supplies in California this summer, which=01*along with other factors=01*dr=
ove
up the cost for power in the state.

Another interesting element to this announcement is the fact that similar
strategic acquisitions are being made possible by mandated divestiture
that other companies have faced due to merger activity. Just yesterday,
I wrote about Duke and Williams embarking on a joint venture to purchase
the Gulfstream pipeline project from Coastal Corp. This sale was made possi=
ble
because Coastal is being forced to divest the pipeline as a result of its
merger with El Paso Energy. As the old adage goes, one company's loss is
another company's gain, which could be viewed as one of the drawbacks of
M&A activity. Another possible trend is the joint activity we are seeing
between companies. The Duke / Williams  and Dynegy / NRG projects are both
examples of companies that have collaborated on development and acquisition
ventures to support both their joint and individual strategies. As the
energy industry becomes more competitive, like-minded companies may find
that they can actually gain more by developing similar strategic alliances,
rather than following a insular path typically exemplified by, for example,
Southern Company.

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Lou, I agree with your legal analysis.  Susan confirmed for me that the TW 
tariff has no specific PCB limit and I think your analysis is accurate on how 
FERC or the courts would react to the  "toxic substances" language that is in 
there.  Please go ahead and get back to Bill and report your conclusions, 
with my endorsement if that adds any value (perhaps the value of another neck 
in the noose).  Also, it is worrysome that PG&E has an argument that any 
dollars they spend on Southwest must be reimbursed by TW under our 
agreement.  They might feel free to pour money on Southwest to keep them 
happy, even if Southwest doesn't put much pressure on PG&E and as a customer 
relationship strategy , in the belief that it is Enron money they are playing 
with.  Can we do anything to keep PG&E honest on this?  

Given all of the above,  is it our strategy to continue to manage this 
Southwest Gas problem as best we can as part of the broader PG&E problem?

Subject: Re: PG&E Summary of events - 12/29/99 - Legal question

Bill raises some good questions.  I've been struggling with the "legal duty" 
question to SW Gas since we do not have a contract with SW - even PG&E does 
not have a contract with SW - PG&E's contract is with SoCal.   Without the 
contractual duty or a tariff requirement ( I don't believe our gas quality 
section would prohibit PCBs - even should they reach level that is regulated 
by the State of California or the EPA ) that sends us back to common law 
duties/causes of action - such as trespass, nuisance, and ordinary 
negligence.  Since PCBs are authorized by the EPA in natural gas pipelines at 
virtually any level as long as certain actions are taken I don't place much 
stock in the common law duties although the EPA's position would not be 
dispositive - merely heavily persuasive.  Other than some type of weak third 
party beneficiary claim is there anything here???

I generally agree with the plan going forward, but before we finalize a SW 
Gas strategy, I want to know what our legal duties are to SW Gas if they find 
high PCB's. Is there an EPA requirement? Were any commitments made by TW to 
SW Gas in past years? Would they go after PG&E and, if so, would that fall 
under or commitment to PG&E to cover costs? Keep me in the loop and let's 
make sure we don't get any press on this until all facts are known and a 
communication plan is in place.

FYI

Once E&C has developed plans to contain PCB's on the PG&E system, we will 
have to get approval for new 2000 Work Orders. I'm just guessing, but we will 
likely incur expenses of $2 to $3 million. This will be for decon work, for 
filter/separators on their system at customer taps, and probably some big 
filter/separators downstream on their A & B Lines. I'll work to find the $ 
from within the 2000 approved Capital limits.

Subject: PG&E Summary of events - 12/29/99

The following is an overview of the discussions that took place today and 
some excellent work by David and our field lads this evening:

Counsel for PG&E contacted Soldano to relay sampling results from last Friday 
testing on the line to SW Gas (five results- all in ug/100cm2) and all from 
internal surfaces on the equipment and short segment of pipe immediately 
upstream of the SW Gas line - ND, 2.4, 1,7, 5.7,2.5)  and to let TW know that 
PG&E and SW personnel would be conducting further sampling today on the SW 
system not far from the Topock C/S.  He was primarily calling to see how TW 
would respond to two questions that had not yet been posed but which may well 
come up soon - 1.) If SW Gas should request compensation/reimbursement for 
issues associated with PCBs what would be TW's response? and 2.) Would TW be 
interested in ensuring that PG&E and TW speak with as common a voice as 
possible and if so, how that might be accomplished.   Neither question was 
answered but PG&E was assured that TW would continue to work as closely as 
possible with PG&E to resolve any issues.  Possible joint phone conferences 
and meetings with SW were discussed including meeting tied to the planned 
meeting in Las Vegas on the 12th.  PG&E also stated that they were ordering a 
small PECO F/S for the SW Gas take off line which they expected to be in the 
$20,000 to $30,000 range

Our internal discussion afterwards suggested that we wait to see the 
analytical results of today's testing (probably due back on Tuesday of next 
week) before committing to any costs coverage issues and that Kevin Hyatt and 
Lorraine Lindberg would follow-up with Rod Boschee on Thursday on the "one 
voice" issue.  A meeting with SW Gas sometime around the 12th would likely be 
as quick a meeting as SW Gas could prepare for and it would be best if we had 
the sample results back before a meeting was scheduled.

David Roensch and the field crew were able to participate in the sampling 
event on the SW Gas system.  They tested some domestic meters which appeared 
in mint condition.  There were no liquids and from appearances alone, PCBs 
may not be present.  SW Gas had their environmental specialist on location 
and the entire SW Gas crew was reported in high spirits and quite friendly 
about the entire situation.

Subject: Scoreboard

I met with Ray and Polly Pettingill last night and we made a decision on the 
scoreboard.  A 27' model made by the Fair-Play company.  The quote is 
$12,360.00 delivered and it has all the options they need.  If we buy it 
there is 7% tax, if we donate the money to the school there is no tax. The 
only item preventing us from placing the order is how to word the memorial.  
Polly is going to visit with the kids and get their thoughts.  Also the 
Pettingill's have asked for discussion at Monday nights school board meeting 
on a proposal to name the football field Dan Reedy Field.  If this goes 
through the memorial panel may say " Welcome To Dan Reedy Memorial Field".  
As soon as they make this decision we'll finalize the art work which takes 
about a week then 4-5 additional weeks for delivery.

 The athletic director is not a real fireball, so Ray is working directly 
with the school superintendent.  I spoke with the superintendent last night 
and stated we would like to donate the money to them for the purchase of the 
scoreboard.  He is cautious in agreeing to anything without knowing more 
details.  Ray was to drop off the materials collected from the scoreboard 
company today, 5/10 so he can get up to speed prior to Monday's board 
meeting.  I'll visit with him again next week.

As I stated after our last meeting, Ray is very interested in performing the 
installation.  Also the Waterloo employees are aware of this and they to want 
to take part in the installation.  I informed Ray last night that we don't 
have a problem with him doing it so that is the plan. One recommendation I 
wish to make is, the cost savings on the installation is $2100, can dedicate 
$1000 from Tom's budget to cover incidentals during installation.  I can 
oversee and purchase these items on my purchasing card.  I don't think Ray 
will be capable of getting all material donated. This way would be much 
easier than donating the extra money to the school and then trying to work 
with the school to pay for these items. 

(P.S.  I have communicated the plans to-date to Lana Reedy, so she is in the 
loop.)

 Brian

Regulatory doesn't have any issues except internal accounting of the revenue 
received and appropriate calculation of the cost charged.   I'll also forward

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Congratulations!  Sounds like the merchant storage business has had a good 
couple of weeks with you guys clearing your environmental hurdles and the 
Tioga guys finally starting construction!  I may have acted rashly in joining 
the evil empire--should have jumped into the storage business instead!  

Tom, are you the point guy for marketing the project?  I'd like to hook you 
up with our Transwestern marketing guys on possible deals to backstop 
Transwestern's "Park and Ride" service.  We are currently authorized by FERC 
to use PG&E market center service for that purpose, but I suspect firm or 
interruptible Lodi service  would be better suited for what we need.     

Best wishes for continued success!

CA Merchant Storage Plant Passes Major Test

     California regulators Thursday released a final environmental impact 
report for the
     state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the 
Sacramento
     Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding 
landowners,
     Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage 
project
     operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the 
approval process for
     environmental review. 

     Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project 
in Texas and
     it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in 
the Bakersfield area,
     according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. 

     Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of 
Sacramento should
     come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this 
summer and be
     operational before the end of the year. "We see the environmental report 
as the 'light at
     the end of the tunnel'," Fossum said. 

     Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California 
Public Utilities
     Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) 
identifying the
     project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then 
was circulated
     to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before 
the final
     report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were 
held by the CPUC
     last October. 

     Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative 
law judge
     for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period 
before the
     project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, 
a CPUC
     spokesperson said. 

     "We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already 
have our
     compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and 
that can go pretty
     quickly," Fossum said. "In the best of all worlds it would be this year; 
in the worst case,
     it would be a year from now." 

     Western Hub has some of its customers lined up, and it is in current 
discussions with
     others, said Fossum, declining for competitive reasons to even identify 
the types of
     customers, although they are expected to be large shippers, marketers, 
power plant
     operators and other large industrial customers. 

     The Lodi project is designed for full operation as having a 12 Bcf 
working capacity,
     with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacities. It will 
be
     connected to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone transmission system 
through a
     35-mile pipeline consisting of three miles of 30-inch-diameter and 32 
miles of
     24-inch-diameter pipe. During the past year's delay in start-up, Western 
has "moved
     the pipeline around a bit, but not a whole lot," Fossum said. "to make 
accommodations
     to nearby farmers." 

     Western Hub's similar-sized Texas project is south of San Antonio and 
would be
     connected with three natural gas transmission systems in the area: 
Houston Pipeline,
     PG&E --- Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
"We
     expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 

     Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
the Bakersfield
     area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
expects to have
     more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
California project
     moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 

     Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
have to connect
     with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
The combined
     Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area.

Ugh.  We are in for a battle.  Some of this may be OK, but I detect an 
underlying philosophy that pipelines should simply not be allowed into 
markets that unregulated players (using the gray market or financial 
products) currently have monopoly control over.  DF

Subject: Prelimiinary Comments on Transport Option Program


Lorraine,

Below are some very preliminary regulatory issues that I have identified
regarding Transwestern's
Transport Option Program.  These concerns may not constitute all of our
concerns; I'm sure there will be more as we continue to review this proposal
with our commercial people.  Also, they have not been reviewed with
management, and may, or may not, represent the ultimate positions that
Conoco (or the Indicated Shipper Trial Group) takes in any proceeding before
the FERC.

Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday.  Both Teddy and I found it
to be very helpful and informative.  We look forward to a more detailed
description of your proposal, and the ability to discuss it with
Transwestern in a future customer meeting.  Please forward this e-mail on to
Jeff; I don't have his direct e-mail address.

Tentative Regulatory Issues regarding Transwestern's Transport Option
Program ("TOP").

1. Market Based Rates.  To the extent that TW intends to offer the TOP
service without a corresponding cost based recourse service, under current
FERC policy, TW would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of
market power.
2. Comparable Service:  To the extent that TW implements a TOP service,
it would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to
offer a similar call & put capability in the capacity release market.  As I
remember TW's tariffs, this would likely require specific changes to the
capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases
with a call or put pricing option.
3. Hoarding:  The TOP service should not be a means for any party
(particularly an affiliate) to manipulate the transportation market and/or
to exert market power by withholding capacity.
4. Reliability:  The TOP service should require sufficient protections
to ensure continued, undiminished service to all of TW's existing and future
FT customers.
5. Standardized Product:  The terms and conditions for the TOP service
should be standardized in order that each TOP service offer is not
considered a "non-conforming" contract under FERC policy.  The call and put
options, and any administrative or operating limitations, should be
specifically defined.
6. Non-preferential Service:  TW must ensure that the TOP service is
offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable, and in a
manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party (particularly
an affiliate).
7. Revenue:  Regardless of whether the TOP is a cost or market based
rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes.
8. Pilot Program.  Given the precedential nature of this proposal,
perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the TOP if it were filed
as an experimental program on TW, with a finite life.  This would allow
parties to gain experience prior to having all of the Enron pipelines (and
others) file for similar authority.

Thanks again.

Thanks--I appre ciate your willingness to help.  One thought Dot had is that 
it might make sense to use someone (i.e., Denise or Ja) who does the actual 
entry of payables into SAP.  Do you do any of that stuff directly on SAP?

To All -

I have been asked to be the Legal Department stakeholder for the final 
development and implementation of the iBuyit program.  Basically, iBuyit is 
an intranet based procurement and payables systems being developed for 
implementation across Enron.  It is intended that this system will become the 
standard method for purchasing any number of services and for paying the 
invoices associated with these purchases.

As a stakeholder, it is my responsibility to assist with the development of 
the product and its marketing (internal to the various Enron Legal 
Departments).  In order to ensure that the development and implementation run 
as planned, the program calls for the appointment of "Change Agents," - 
defined as:

"individuals who are highly respected within their area and known as the 'GO 
TO' people among their peers."

Though I am sure this definition fits each of you to a tee within your 
respective departments, I am also well aware that schedules may prohibit you 
from being the Change Agent.  Accordingly, what I am in need of is assistance 
in designating that one person within your respective departments who can 
become the Change Agent for your group.  The responsibilities of this 
position are the following:

 - to disseminate communications regarding the project
- to develop awareness and ownership of the product among their department
- to encourage use of the product
- identify those who will need training
- encourage peer training attendance 
- engage in rumor control (basically relay the facts of the program and not 
the myths (e.g., the product will replace jobs))

In picking the appropriate candidate, I would make sure that he/she has a 
working knowledge of the procurement and payables practices of your group, 
together with knowledge of the SAP system.  Since the iBuyit system will 
interface with SAP, this latter knowledge would be very useful.

Please let me know as soon as possible who is the likely candidate from your 
group so that I can meet with them and bring them up to speed on the 
program.  For your benefit, I have attached below the general information 
that has been provided to stakeholders about  the program.

If any of you should have any questions, please call me.

Thanks.

Per our discussion last week, this is the status on Pueblo.  I think we need 
to establish to our satisfaction the bona fides of Dennis' government 
contracting scheme before we pitch hard to have ENA get into the deal and 
scrub down the numbers on the power plant.  If our govcon gurus (Bill Votaw 
and Bill Gang--both ex military guys working on DOD outsourcing deals for 
Enron Federal Solutions) buy off on it, then I think we brief Stan at that 
point.  You, Stan and Steve will then need to decide the best way to pitch 
ENA to verify the economics and potentially get into the deal.  Either we'd 
have Stan push from the top down or have Kevin and  Steve go directly to the 
ENA deal guys.  More to follow.

Subject: Pueblo

I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager for 
the Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and 
Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts 
team might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next 
week or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their 
outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the key--he 
is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my 
old firm in DC.  The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all 
through their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretations 
and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD.  Bill and Bill--does such a 
meeting sound productive?  If so, should we have outside govt. contracts 
counsel present and if so, who do you suggest?  

On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that 
he was in the middle of a "big drafting project"--revising Dennis' joint 
venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my 
concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this

Subject: 1999 Mastio Review


As you all know we have received detail information supporting the ET&S 
rating out of 50 companies, and we have been analyzing such information in 
preparation for a review with Stan and his direct reports by mid March.  I 
have been discussing our preliminary results with various different groups 
within ET&S and need to also get your input. Therefore, I have set up a 
meeting on Tuesday March 7th at 1:30 p.m. in EB49C2, to review our 
preliminary findings. The goal of this meeting is to review the data we have 
received from the focus group of ET&S customers, and to discuss such results 
from the standpoint of 5 areas we can focus on for improvement both short and 
long term.  Please be expecting a draft of the results from Tammy Lee-Jaquet, 
by close of business this Friday to allow time for review prior to this 
meeting. 

Thank you,
Ricki

SCE, California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans; FERC to Meet This
Week
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Southern California Edison (SCE) filed a four-point plan calling on the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to act by year's end to settle
the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting
from California's dysfunctional electricity market. This follows a separate
measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy
purchases. FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov. 1 to discuss the California
power market and remedies for the state's troubled move to deregulate retail
service, which caused drastic price spikes this summer.

ANALYSIS: This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding 
California's
energy market. FERC's meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with
a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some
sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market.

First, let's establish what SCE is proposing. SCE has petitioned the CPUC
to take four immediate steps: 1). Support market reform by providing utilities
with greater freedom to contract for longer-term supplies of power, completing
review of SCE's bilateral contract proposals, and rectifying market structure
problems that have become apparent; 2). Confirm that utilities will be
able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of
customers; 3). Implement a post-rate-freeze rate stabilization plan instead
of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile
wholesale power costs, and provide for a modest rate increase beginning
Jan. 1, 2001, to avoid larger future increases; and 4). End the uncertainty
about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets.

I think this can all be translated as follows. 1). SCE (and presumably
PG&E) want to overturn California's strong resistance against bilateral
contracts. Under California restructuring law, the local distribution company
must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange. Bilateral contracts
with generators are largely prohibited, meaning that currently in California
suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities, as is allowed
in other states such as Texas. 2). SCE and PG&E are both in severe debt,
due to accumulated under-collection resulting from the disparity between
the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service 
territories.
SCE's debt is about $2.4 billion, while PG&E's debt could be as much as
$2.9 billion. Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their
debt. 3). SCE and PG&E want to avoid the sky-high prices that San Diego
Gas & Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to 
market-based
prices this summer. SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase
rates by less than 10 percent, keeping rates at 1996 levels when adjusted
for inflation. SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more
formal proposal to the CPUC, but believes that the less-than-10 percent
increase would be sufficient to recoup its $2.4 billion debt if it were
in place for four to five years. 4). AB1890 strongly encouraged that the
California IOUs divest their power plants, as part of the agreements for
stranded cost recovery. SCE sold 12 natural-gas plants, and presently has
two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow.
The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of
plants currently in escrow, and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide
whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed.

The California ISO's proposal is more specific, but also geared toward
market stabilization. The Cal-ISO wants to implement a $100/MWh bid cap
(reduced from $250/MWh) on electricity purchases in the ISO's spot market.
However, the Cal-ISO's plan includes several exemptions, including those
generators that can prove they will lose money at the $100 rate, generators
that contract 70 percent of their supply to serve California customers,
and generators producing less than 50 MW (renewable power, imported power,
etc.) Thus, the current rate cap of $250/MWh would remain in place and
serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from
the $100 payment cap.

Further, the Cal-ISO wants to require that generators contract 70 percent
of their capacity in forward markets, and that users schedule at least
85 percent of their load in forward markets. The Cal-ISO contends that
California IOUs should be easily able to schedule 85 percent of their load
by entering into contracts with generators. The Cal-ISO wants to affix
a "real-time deficiency charge" on both generators and users that do not
use the forward markets. The Cal-ISO submitted its plan to FERC because
it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California, but on
a national basis.

Although the Cal-ISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective,
the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its
own state. The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden
on the Cal-ISO's Real-Time Market, which was designed to handle only 5
percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets, but in fact is
handling about 20 to 30 percent. The Cal-ISO proposal seems to be taking
into account the problem of an out-of-sync wholesale/retail market by 
encouraging
generation to stay in the state.  Otherwise, capped generators may sell
power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed $100
per megawatt hour in the neighboring states.  Should FERC approve this
national rate cap, however, it will be precedent setting and will signal
that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated.

As noted, FERC plans to meet on Nov. 1 to examine the California market
in detail. FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late
August, with its investigation focused on the summer's price spikes, the
state's market structure including the Cal-ISO and the Power Exchange,
as well as market-based sellers in California. The meeting this week 
reportedly
will disclose findings from FERC's investigation and "consider proposed
remedies."

 SCE's proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on
FERC's agenda for approval. However, it is likely that whatever FERC decides
will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCE's plan. In particular,
FERC will be examining the issue of market power, and whether or not any
generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system
by withholding generation to drive up energy prices. And the problem is
by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer. Even though
the summer demand season has now ended, wholesale prices remain high, a
problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural
gas across the country.

That was an interesting little conversation.  I came back down and looked for 
you guys but you had both split.  We should take a few minutes and plug John 
in on what happened at the end of that meeting when the power issues came 
up.  I'm somewhat surprised at Bill's reaction, but what the hell, now we can 
run with Cunningham, and we know MKM's pulse on Hubbard (and Bill's).  Pretty 
damn good end to the week, all things considered.  DF

First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that 
used to be IT.
It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A 
receipt point has now been specified:  Bloomfield Compressor.  Our tariff 
allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the 
parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated 
us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they 
determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.  
Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff.
I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute.

We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates

Hey--how the hell are you?  Still having fun and living large in the big 
apple?  Things are great on the prarie--Huskers are No. 1 in the nation (I'm 
actually talking about college womens volleyball since I refuse to watch 
professional Husker football) and wife and small chicks are doing great.  As 
to SD firm, I've almost hired Lynn Jackson Schultz and LeBrun a couple of 
times and then ended up not needing them.  I think its the biggest firm in SD 
(big whoop)  and is pretty well thought of.  I went to college with a partner 
in their Sioux Falls office named Jon Sogn.  He's a commercial litigator and 
a pretty good guy.  Good luck and hope all goes well.  DF

Subject: Proposal to Caithness Big Sandy

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Looks good to me--and I agree that we ought to use if for internal purposes 
only.  If people at the customer meeting want more detail than you guys are 
able to provide orally, we could consider adding detail to the FERC filing or 
even sending them some additional explanation that we may or may not decide 
to file with FERC.  Good luck today!  DF

You hit the ball right down the middle.  I think we've answered these 
questions [more than] adequately.  I do not intend to distribute these

Jeff, here's a slightly revised version of my bottom-line answers to Conoco's

Drew/Mark,

Further to conversation this morning with Drew, it appears that it would be=

helpful to include the Request for Service (TFX) form in the GTC, as this i=

the form which FERC has approved for use when a customer requests pipeline=

capacity.

This would mean inserted something like the following into the Long=20
Description: "Customer agrees that this transaction will be governed by the=

terms contained within the online General Terms and Conditions (GTC)."

Which would make the final long description:

A transaction with Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG) under which NNG will=

Effective Monday, November 6, Stan Horton's weekly staff meeting will be 
expanded to include representatives from ETS marketing, regulatory, legal and 
operations in order to facilitate the communication and discussion of key 
commercial matters.  This revised staff meeting format will eliminate the 
need for Dan McCarty's and Julia White's separate Monday morning staff 
meetings.

With the expansion of the attendee list, it is important that reports be 
concise and focused on new developments that have not been previously 
communicated.

These meetings will begin at 9:15AM and are expected to conclude by 10:30AM.

TXU Sued By 23 Texas Cities Over Franchise Fees
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The City of Denton, Texas, has filed a lawsuit against TXU Electric & Gas,
claiming that the utility intentionally underpaid Denton its franchise
fees by not accurately reporting its gross revenues, on which franchise
fees are based. To date, 23 cities have signed resolutions to join Denton
in the lawsuit and more are expected. An initial audit by Denton claims
that the amount that TXU owes could potentially exceed $240 million.

ANALYSIS: Over this last year, several utilities in Texas have come under
fire for allegedly not paying the full amount of franchise fees for which
various cities claim they are obligated. This suit against TXU is just
the latest, but it follows a judgment against Reliant Energy earlier this
spring and a pending suit against CPL (a subsidiary of AEP/CSW).

Franchise fees are essentially rental payments that a city has the right
to charge a utility for use of the city's public streets and grounds for
the placement of pipelines, poles and utility cables. Texas state law allow=
s
cities to charge utilities 2 percent of their gross revenues for the right
to franchises within a city's limits. Some utilities such as Reliant entere=
d
into agreements=01*stretching back to the 1950s=01*that obligate them to pa=
y
4 percent of gross revenues earned in a city in exchange for 50-year=20
franchises.
In any case, the cities are arguing that franchise fees should be based
on gross revenue, not net revenue, that the utilities have earned from
providing service within the city limits.

Herein lies the core of the litigation as, in this case, the City of Denton
is claiming that TXU intentionally reported lower gross revenue, thereby
reducing the amount it was required to pay to Denton and the other cities
involved in the lawsuit. The cities involved in the suit claim they are
entitled to not only unpaid franchise fees from TXU, but punitive damages
as well.

The prognosis may not be very good for TXU, if a similar case against Relia=
nt
Energy is any indication. In May, a Houston jury ruled that Reliant-HL&P
"acted with malice by intentionally underpaying cities for decades for
the exclusive right to sell electricity in those cities." The state distric=
t
court ordered HL&P to pay $34.2 million to the cities of Pasadena, Galvesto=
n
and Wharton. The award consisted of $30 million in punitive damages, anothe=
r
$3 million because it was determined that HL&P had defrauded the cities,
and $1.2 million in actual damages. That seemed to be just the start of
Reliant's problems, as following that case 47 additional cities, including
Houston, came together and launched a class-action suit against Reliant
HL&P, again claiming that the utility intentionally underpaid franchise
fees for the sole right to provide power in the cities. This lawsuit is
claiming $113 million in damages, the bulk of which ($77 million) is allott=
ed
for the City of Houston.

However, illustrating how polarized this issue is, just last week a state
district judge overturned the $34.2 million ruling for the first three
cities, and reduced the damages down to $1.2 million. In addition, the
same judge overturned the separate ruling that had given the green light
for the 47 cities to proceed with the class-action suit. Both rulings are
still being appealed by the cities in hopes to reinstate the award for
fraud and punitive damages. In addition, the 47 cities involved in the
new lawsuit against Reliant are proceeding=01*just with 47 individual cases
instead of one. Sound confusing? It certainly is, and it will no doubt
amount to one big mess if the cities are not permitted to band together
in one class-action suit.

Here's Reliant's position in the litigation, which is presently supported
by the Texas State District Court. Reliant claims that transactions that
do not generate profits or represent the selling of power in a city=01*such
as reconnection fees, renting pole space to other utilities and sending
electricity to other markets=01*should not be considered part of gross reve=
nue
and, therefore, not subject to franchise fees. Thus, the figure Reliant
reported as gross revenue may indeed be lower than the cities expected
it to be=01*but it is an accurate number, based on Reliant's interpretation=
.

As noted, CPL is also involved in a pending lawsuit with the City of San
Juan, Texas, and a group of about 30 other cities. These cities claim that
CPL underpaid franchise fees and seek damages of up to $300 million plus
attorney's fees. CPL has filed a counterclaim for overpayment of franchise
fees and intends to defend itself against the cities' claims.

How all of this will impact the case against TXU is unclear, but certainly
the momentum is growing against the utilities in Texas. TXU, like Reliant
and CPL, maintains that it has done nothing wrong and that it has paid
in full all of the fees owed to the over 330 Texas cities and towns to
which it provides electric service. Again, the center of the dispute lies
in how to calculate gross revenues. TXU contends that gross revenue include=
s
only the direct proceeds it has received from the sale of electricity and
natural gas. The City of Denton, on the other hand, argues that gross reven=
ue
also should include other income such as taxes and fees collected for bad
checks, which conceivably could result in a much higher figure, especially
when calculated over a 40-year period.

TXU had 1999 operating revenues of approximately $17.1 billion so, like
Reliant, a settlement in the $1.2 million range would not wield much financ=
ial
impact. However, more important to these utilities may be the fact that
this could be just the beginning of a string of similar lawsuits, brought
forward by cities across Texas. Consider the class action suit against
Reliant, to the tune of $113 million. If that suit is allowed to proceed,
we're talking about big money, especially when attorney fees are added
to the equation. In addition, the reputation of these utilities is at stake=
.
The cities initiating the lawsuits are using such terms as "unlawful busine=
ss
practices" and claiming that every dollar utilities like TXU and Reliant
have not paid to the cities means a dollar increase in taxes for citizens.
As deregulation continues to unfold, a utility's reputation will be one
of the foundations on which it attracts new customers and retains current
ones.

It's also important to note that under Texas' restructuring law, once=20
competition
begins in the state (January 2002) the formula to determine franchise fees
in the state will switch from a revenue formula to a consumption formula.
In other words, the amount that utilities collected as gross revenue in
1998 will be divided by the amount of total kilowatt hours consumed within
the city limits during the same year, and that will be the amount of the
franchise fee owed by utilities to cities. The franchise fee shall be equal
to the charge per kilowatt hour determined for 1998, multiplied times the
number of kilowatt hours delivered within the city limits. Of course, all
of these pending lawsuits are bringing into question the amount of gross
revenue that was collected during 1998, which might make this formula=20
difficult
to calculate. In any case, I don't see these issues subsiding any time
soon as they are based on a fundamentally different interpretation of how
to define gross revenue. The real winners in these lawsuits may be the
attorneys themselves, as undoubtedly these cases will remain in litigation
for several years.

I'm sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of 
activity lately related to Enron's evaluation of possible acquisitions.  John 
Goodpasture's group has kept a large number of ET&S people engaged in looking 
at a number of potential deals.  While these deal evaluation projects have 
become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are 
extremely confidential.  Even after a potential seller has announced that it 
is up for sale, the fact that Enron is looking at a potential deal, as well 
as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential.  

I realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees 
of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the 
future.  If you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at 
the target company asks whether Enron is evaluating the contact's company or 
assets, the only appropriate response is that Enron personnel are not 
permitted to discuss potential acquisitions.  Please be aware that the 
confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition 
evaluation process preclude any communication by Enron people with employees 
of the target company.  

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do 
not hesitate to give me a call.  Thank you for your assistance.  
DF

Mike, Louis, and Drew,

This follows up on my e-mails to you and my conversations with Mike about 
this subject.  We want to make sure that you are not caught in a year-end 
problem if you want to get the usual December estimates for Unit bills.  
Unfortunately, as Becky indicates, if we do not receive your instructions 
regarding this by December 12 at the very latest, then it will be too late 
for us to do what you want.

I assume that if you want December estimates, you will also want them from 
outside counsel.  Last year, it took a good deal of time to get those 
estimates from the attorneys representing your (and other Enron entities') 
interests in the Grynberg/Quinque cases.  I have received no instructions 
from you with regard to these or any other outside counsel. 

We greatly value our representation of the GPG and want to help in any way we 
can.  Please let us know what we can do.

Britt

Britt, I am finalizing the Unit billing schedule for December and I need some 
information.  We will be sending out the bills for the November time on 
December 14th.  After that, we will issue another billing for December 1 - 14 
time.  Those bills will go out the last week of December.  If the GPG wants 
to have estimates for the remainder of December time, then we need to know 
that by December 12th, at the very latest.  Please let me know their wishes 
as soon as you find out.  Thanks, Becky

Subject: Richardson testimony - (this gets ugly)

Richardson says FBI has determined drives did not leave Los Alamos
June 21, 2000 
Web posted at: 3:00 PM EDT (1900 GMT) 


By Ian Christopher McCaleb/CNN

WASHINGTON -- Two highly sensitive computer hard drives that were missing 
from the Los Alamos National Laboratories earlier this year never left the 
premises, and the FBI has uncovered no hints of espionage in the case, Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson told a Senate committee Wednesday. 

  
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson    
 
The two hard drives, each smaller than a deck of playing cards, held vital 
nuclear weapons secrets and were stored in a secured vault at the storied New 
Mexico nuclear weapons laboratory. 

In a statement opening a lengthy and touchy hearing of Senate Armed Services 
Committee, Richardson said: "Based upon the investigation by the FBI so far, 
there is no evidence of espionage, nor is there evidence the drives have ever 
left Los Alamos." 

Richardson added that the FBI seems to be on the verge of reconstructing what 
happened to the drives, saying, "Latent fingerprints were found on the scene, 
and on the external wrappings of the drives themselves." 

The FBI continues to comb the "crime scene" -- a room housing a copy machine 
-- and a grand jury has been convened, Richardson said, punctuating his 
statement with a declaration that a handful of so-called Los Alamos 
"X-Division" employees have offered conflicting statements to investigators. 

The secretary speculated that the disappearance of the hard drives may have 
been an unintentional mistake by a lab employee, who feared coming forward 
when alarms were raised. 

"I will not take (disciplinary) action until I have all the facts before me," 
he said, vowing, "I will not rest until I know what happened -- when, where, 
why and by whom." 

The FBI has said the drives disappeared "at the tail-end of March of this 
year, March 28," Richardson said. Should the FBI's timeline prove correct, 
reports issued at the beginning of this week that the drives have been 
missing since January could be called into question. 

The two hard drives were discovered missing on May 7, when weapons scientists 
took an inventory of the drives stored within a vault at the laboratory's 
X-Division as a massive wildfire approached the facility. The section is 
perhaps the most sensitive area of the facility, and is where the most 
classified nuclear weapons research, design and development is undertaken. 

The scientists had been tasked with checking to assure that all of the 
division's drives were safely within the vault in the event that the lab 
would have to be evacuated. An evacuation was ordered the next day because of 
the fire threat, but no one reported the drives missing until May 31, 
sparking a massive search of the area -- and deep anger in Washington. 

The drives contain vital information on the makeup of U.S., Russian, Chinese 
and French nuclear weapons. They mysteriously reappeared last Friday in a 
room at the lab that already had been searched several times. 

Richardson taken to task early, and often
Richardson's pledge to bring accountability to bear on those responsible for 
the missing drives was met with cold stares from committee members of both 
parties. Members of the Senate have awaited the secretary's appearance for 
several days, after he last week declined an opportunity to offer Senate 
testimony, saying he wanted to wait until he had more information. 

  
Sen. Strom Thurmond    
 
The safety of weapons secrets has dogged Richardson for much of his tenure as 
Energy Secretary. During his watch, Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was 
removed from his position amid charges of spying. He has been formally 
charged with mishandling classified information -- not espionage -- and 
awaits trial. 

Members of Congress have also raised red flags over the reported sale of 
computers once used at the Savannah River nuclear weapons facility in 
Augusta, Georgia. Those computers, two senators intimated Wednesday, may have 
once contained classified information that could have been reconstructed by 
their new owners. 

Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-South Carolina) suggested at Wednesday's hearings that 
some of the Savannah River computers may have been sold to the People's 
Republic of China. 

  
Sen. John Warner    
 
In his opening statement, Armed Services Chairman John Warner (R-Virginia) 
lined Richardson himself up for accountability, saying that although 
Richardson has worked to change the security culture at the Energy Department 
and the national laboratories, ultimately, responsibility for ongoing lapses 
rests with him. 

"Mr. Secretary," Warner said directly to Richardson, "On June 23rd of last 
year you told this committee, in this room: 'The secretary of Energy,' and I 
quote you, '...must be accountable and must be responsible" for such security 
failures. 

" ... We are holding you accountable," Warner said. "These incidents happened 
on your watch. Like the captain of a ship, you must bear full 
accountability." 

Appearing at the hearing, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Alabama), chairman of the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, repeated his earlier calls for 
Richardson's resignation, saying, "I think it's time for you to go." 

Harsher still was the criticism leveled by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-West 
Virginia), a member of Richardson's own party, who said Richardson's pledges 
to get to the bottom of the case would not sway the opinion of the Senate, 
whose trust he had lost permanently. 

  
Sen. Richard Shelby    
 
"The horse is out of the barn," Byrd said. Referring to Richardson's refusal 
to testify last week, Byrd said, "You've waited and shown contempt of 
Congress that borders on supreme arrogance." 

Speaking directly to Richardson, a one-time congressman and former Ambassador 
to the United Nations, Byrd said, "You had a bright and brilliant career, but 
you will never again receive the support of the U.S. Senate for any office 
you seek. You have squandered your treasure." 

Richardson, who at times looked stunned by the tone taken by many committee 
members, sought to defend himself -- arguing that he wanted to have "all the 
facts" in hand before making a congressional appearance. He added that he had 
made vast changes in the security culture at the department and in the 
nation's weapons laboratories, and had put off a good many longtime employees 
as a consequence. 

"I've been excoriated, but if you go into the scientific and academic 
community, I am driving scientists away." He also said he has been accused of 
racism in the Wen Ho Lee case, and has had to battle members of own party who 
saw regular polygraph tests for employees as a violation of civil rights. 

Sen. James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) suggested that the "captain of the ship" 
wasn't Richardson, but President Bill Clinton, who Inhofe said was 
responsible for a variety of security policy changes and leaks to the media 
that have led to a relaxed, careless attitude among those charged with 
overseeing the nation's weapons secrets. 

'Serious loss of control over classified information'
Also appearing before the panel was Dr. John Browne, director of the Los 
Alamos facility. 

  
Dr. John Browne    
 
Browne, while attempting to illustrate for panel members -- with charts -- 
just how difficult it is to gain access to the X-Division, admitted that his 
security operatives have lost control over how classified information is 
handled -- mainly because there is no set procedure to determine who handled 
much of the material and when. 

"This is not an environment one can easily get into," he said. 

Still, Browne said, "there is a serious loss of control over classified 
information at my laboratory," adding, perhaps for the benefit of committee 
members, that he had "no knowledge that the information has been compromised 
or tampered with. 

"From a national security perspective, these are positive indications." 

Richardson was congratulated by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico) for ceding 
all weapons security issues to a newly confirmed director of a 
semi-autonomous agency formed to assess and reformulate all security 
procedures. 

  
Sen. Pete Domenici    
 
Air Force Gen. John Gordon, confirmed by the Senate to helm the agency but 
not as yet sworn into the post, will report to Richardson, but will not be 
directed by anyone else at the Energy Department. 

The Senate had held up Gordon's confirmation for months for unspecified 
reasons, but he was unanimously confirmed last week after news of the hard 
drives' disappearance was released. 

"The best thing you could do to leave a legacy for America in terms of 
nuclear weapons is to [get this agency operational]," Domenici said, scolding 
Richardson not to engage in any "dual-hatting," and let Gordon make the 
changes he needs to make. 

Warner was less congratulatory, warning Richardson outright that he must 
honor the 1999 law creating the agency and allow it to go about its business 
unfettered. 

The panel closed its session to the public and members of the media just 
after noon on Wednesday so specifics of the case could be discussed. Domenici 
predicted earlier in the day that a closed session would yield much more in 
the way of disturbing information. 

"We could go into a closed session, and you wouldn't believe the things you'd 
hear in there," he said. "These things have to be corrected too." 

When proceedings ended at mid-afternoon, Richardson told reporters he just 
wanted "to do his job" and conclude the investigation. He said the fallout 
from the security breach was "too political," adding, "I did not utter one 
partisan word in that committee." 

'Conflicting statements'
Initially, Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, the Energy Department's top 
security officer, and Los Alamos Lab Director John Browne said in 
congressional testimony that a scientist had reported seeing the two devices 
in the vault on April 7, a month before they were found missing and seven 
weeks before senior lab officials were notified. 

  
Gen. Eugene Habiger    
 
But sources familiar with the investigation told CNN on Tuesday that this 
account has come under suspicion because of "conflicting statements" made 
during interviews and polygraph tests. 

Another individual has told investigators he went into the vault on April 27 
and would have noticed if they had been missing then, but does not recall 
actually seeing them. 

What's clear, said Goss, is that there was inadequate tracking on paper of 
the use of the two drives, which belonged to an emergency nuclear response 
team. Members of the team, known as NEST, have been the focus of the FBI 
criminal investigation. The team is trained to be ready to find and disarm a 
nuclear device on short notice. 

The disks, or drives, are designed for use in a laptop computer and are part 
of an emergency response "kit" available to team members . 

All 26 individuals who had unescorted access to the vault have been given 
polygraph tests, according to Richardson. 

Browne, the lab's director, has testified that security rules for the 
tracking of items classified as secret were eased government-wide in 1992 to 
reduce the cost of handling the large amount of documents carrying this 
designation. 

In early 1993 it was extended by then-President Bush to government 
contractors such as the University of California, which runs the Los Alamos 
lab. The policy was continued by the Clinton administration. 

The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board a year ago cited 
inadequate tracking of secret nuclear materials in a stinging rebuke of 
security at the Energy Department and its weapons labs. 

While the current Los Alamos security break likely did not involve espionage, 
"in some ways it's worse," former Sen. Warren Rudman, chairman of the 
advisory board, said in an interview. "Espionage is very hard to guard 
against. You win some and lose some. Here you've got a situation where there 
is just sloppy accountability and record keeping." 

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Please send me the NN and TW operating reports from the minutes of the last 
meeting.  I'm not sure we create a separate set of goals and objectives for 
each operating company, although Bill's ET&S goals and objectives obviously 
cover both.  I want to see if we need to create some kind of new document or 
whether we can use something off the shelf.  Thanks. DF

Subject: Board of Directors Meetings

We have scheduled Board of Directors meetings for TW and Northern on August 
28, 2000. An agenda will be circulated soon along with proposed resolutions.  
Since we skipped a board meeting for TW last year, the operating report for 
TW should cover 1998 to the present for purposes of adopting any necessary 
resolutions.  For Northern, we will cover from 1999 to the present.  The 
minutes of past meetings indicate that you used an update of TW's and 
Northern's goals and objectives as the basis for the operating reports.  I 
assume that we will continue to do this for the upcoming meetings.

Drew - Just wanted to follow up on our discussion on Monday about new 
services, especially hourly firm.   As we discussed
our team does not see a need to create or offer this service at this time.   
However, we did not get a chance to discuss the merits of going forward 
anyway to act on the receptivity of FERC to these services.   Please give me 
a call or let me know when we can stop by to discuss briefly.  I would like 
Tim to participate in the discussion as well.  He is out today meeting w/
GRE and will be back on Friday.

Thanks.  John 

PS - I could give you a quick update on Hubbard at that time also.

delivery products that are "daily" in nature (one is for receipt at Ventura 
and the other is for receipt at Demarc).  The rate aspect is the same 
language as the one-part rates we have already used (designated as "R+C).  
This "Dly" designation means that the term is one day which will be rolled 
over day-to-day unless either party cancels the rollover.  The term language 
shown here is the same as the "daily" language we have been using.  Call me

Don't know why I didn't think to look in Secretariat:

http://home.enron.com:84/secretariat/CDS12547.htm


It's currently a sub of Transwestern Pipeline Company.   Is this the best 
positioning for legal/regulatory purposes?  I liked your idea, Drew, of 
having it be a sub of Enron Pipeline Company.

If it's a sub of TW, it'll get disclosed in the TW Form 2.  I don't know 
whether that's a concern for you.

Subject: Preliminary Oklahoma Agenda

In discussion with Dave, we thought it would be good to put this together in 
a format of questions and answers.
However, as you will see, the questions I thought of got kinda long- but I 
think we need answers for all of them. 
One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in 
with the first two questions as I've listed. 
Please provide me your thoughts asap.   MK

Unless we have bought something that I'm not aware of, I don't believe TW or 
NN has any assets or operations in Louisiana and therefore should not be 
subject to the referenced tax.  As far as other jurisdictions, I don't expect 
that we'd have a problem with in-kind payment as an additional payment 
option.  On TW, which has no fuel tracker, in kind tax payment probably 
wouldn't help us.  Northern does have a fuel tracker, however, and might 
avoid adverse earnings impact from tax volatility if we could pay those taxes 
in kind and stick them in the tracker.  We probably couldn't do that until 
the next rate case, however, because all current taxes are built into our 
base rates at some representative level.

It's against my nature, but I'm getting pretty close to giving up.  Attached 
is a draft letter to Langley punting the project.  I've tried to sugar coat 
it as much as possible so he doesn't get pissed off and automatically go to 
El Paso if he does somehow get the project built.  The letter is based on the 
assumption that we will call them first to explain where we are.   Also, I've 
assumed that we won't send Dennis any of the data from EE&CC or ENA.  I think 
we can chat generally on the phone and give them the ballpark results without 
actually sending the schedules to him.  Please give me a call so we can help 
Steve with his script for when he calls Langley.  (did you notice how I 
disappear when things start to go south?)  Talk to you soon.  DF

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20

When you guys give me a new computer, can I get a (smaller) laptop with some 
kind of docking station???  I don't need a desktop if I get a good laptop.. 
I'd suggest we keep the IBM laptop as the department's roving laptop if it is 
upgradable to Windows 2000.  Thanks.  DF

I've just been invited to a couple of meetings on Friday PM--the kind of 
meetings where the word "invited" is used humorously.  I think I'm still 
clear after 4:00 pm Omaha time so could be dialed in after then if it would 
be useful.  Sorry to be such a pain inthe ass but getting fired would be a 
real inconvenience right now so I'd better post at these meetings.  I'll have 
Martha coordinate with you guys.

The reviews are in and TheLaw.net is saving subscribers tons of time and 
money by offering a new way to solve old research problems at a low, flat 
rate that's affordable to anyone.

--AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE
Noted law cybrarian Genie Tyburski writes that "[t]he busy sole 
practitioner...may find TheLaw.net an inexpensive alternative to Lexis or 
Westlaw and a helpful index to select legal information sites." Says a 
practitioner from Colorado: "I found it easy to use (certainly easier than 
Lexis/Westlaw)."

Our subscribers in larger environments have found that TheLaw.net is the 
perfect complement to any West or Lexis plan that may be limited to your 
jurisdiction or practice area; an addition that allows you to go outside that 
premium wine package and survey a significant subset of the universe without 
any transaction, printing, viewing or download hassles.

--LEXIS BILL SLASHED BY 90%
An intellectual property firm subscriber of ours in Chicago dropped us an 
email just last week to say that "[y]our concept is great....for the money 
there is no better bargain for legal research. Our Lexis bills have dropped 
to 10% of what they were before. Thanks!"

Of course your results may vary, but for less than $25 a month annualized 
TheLaw.net gives you all the efficiency of electronic case law research 
without any of the conflicting emotions that come from a meter being held to 
your head. As the list below makes plain, TheLaw.net is indeed the world's 
best value for Federal and state appellate case law research whether you are 
at work, at home or on the road. And best of all, you get everything we 
have--all you can eat--for the same low, flat rate.

--KEEPING UP WITH THE LAW AND THE INTERNET
Everyone knows that in its raw form the Internet looks like a law library 
with the books all over the floor. That's why we developed this best 
practices software solution which incorporates a 50,000 link drop-down menu 
system for getting around online, together with our proprietary searchable 
database of Federal and State Appellate cases, 167 jurisdictions in all, over 
four million cases, updated daily.

NO RISK 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
Your no risk Personal, Convenience or Workgroup Edition includes an 
unconditional 30 day money-back guarantee. Five attorneys in a firm or 
workgroup, for example, get unlimited use for one year for only $995; 
individual users for just $295. You'll be up and running in mere minutes and 
we can deliver your software today!

Please follow up with Lou on this.  It sounds like something the commercial 
people would be in a good position to answer, so maybe start by finding out 
if they are already responding, either through Lou or otherwise.  Then get 
the right people to review and supplement this list.  Thanks. df

Subject: ETS Products/Services

EHS Corporate has asked we verify this inventory of services/products  from 
all of the various companies that fit under the very broadest form of the ETS 
umbrella.  I offer the following thoughts:  I don't believe EOTT has any 
relationship with the Mt. Belvieu storage operations; I don't know if we 
purchase natural gas except for fuel purposes; do we currently have any gas 
gathering facilities?? or just transmission??; EOTT Fleet Vehicles could be 
better defined; Risk Management services??

Feedback would be extremely helpful before the 17th

Lou,

This is a follow-up to a meeting we had about 2 months ago on Life Cycle 
Impact Assessments.  The 1st phase of the assessment involves completing an 
inventory of Enron's products\services and volumes.  I am currently 
requesting each business unit to verify the products and services we have 
identified and make any modifications to the list.  I am enlisting your 
assistance to do this for ETS, including EOTT.  I need to have the 
verification completed by 11/17. Please advise if you have any questions.



Thanks,
Susan Worthen

Subject: Re: Quarterly Noteholder Reports  

Thanks for your comments below. 

We consulted our AA folks in drafting the disclosures.  It wasn't a big deal 
for Enron's 10Q because the positions between NNG and TW are eliminated in 
the consolidated statements.  As for the Form 2 and the Brown Covers, there 
are specific GAAP disclosure requirements that we have to include on a 
stand-alone basis.  Since most of these positions will be gone by year end, 
it won't look nearly as massive as it was at the end of the third quarter.  
In fact, if Roger Willard had given us his final word about the transactions 
in time, we would have booked the ultimate net transactions in September and 
we wouldn't have had all these gross positions.  I don't feel quite as bad 
about not getting it right in the unaudited third quarter financials as I 
otherwise would, since we did review the transactions and the noteholders 
disclosures with AA before the 3rd quarter was released and before the 
noteholders reports were distributed.  

As always, Legal and Regulatory will have ample opportunity to comment on 
Brown Cover and Form 2 disclosures before they are finalized.

Subject: Quarterly Noteholder Reports

I've reviewed the draft NN and TW quarterly reports to noteholders.  I 
haven't had a chance to compare these to prior quarterly filings, but I have 
three questions/concerns.  First, the discussions of "Price Risk Management 
Activities" seem overly detailed and cumbersome given the true commercial 
impact of the deals involved.  For example, we disclose the total notional 
amount of gas involved in the Transcanada deal, the "fair value" of the 
trades, and a variety of  other details, even the total economic impact of 
the deal to us is pretty small (about a million dollars if I remember 
right).  The base gas deal, by comparison, was discussed in one sentence.  
Can we avoid making the thing look bigger than it really is by disclosing 
something more meaningful like VAR (which I assume would be a much smaller 
number)?  Second, disclosing TW and NN trading activity separately makes the 
Transcanada deal look like a bigger thing than it really was, since the TW 
and NN portions offset one another.  I know we need to disclose deals 
separately for each operating company, but is there a way things like 
notional value and "fair value" (or VAR) can be aggregated to more accurately 
reflect the total impact of the deal--currently it looks like both TW and NN 
were out doing huge commodity deals.  Third, I have never been that concerned 
about overly broad disclosures in the noteholder reports because of the 
limited distribution.   However, if these disclosures will be Arthur 
Anderson's template for the Enron Corp. 10Q or the FERC Form 2s, I have a 
real problem.  

Please let me know if I can be of help in talking through these issues.  DF

Travel: - OUT OF OFFICE
I will be on vacation MONDAY  - 11/6/00
I expect to be in the Houston office the remainder of the week
I will be attending a Cross Function Team meeting in Albuquerque on 11/15/00 
- presenting the UAF Fundamentals information

GPG Continuous Improvement Task Force - Measurement and Invoicing Process:
We are in the final stages of setting up a meeting of the units named in the 
CI Accountability / Responsibility matrix.  As you will recall, one of the 
recommendations of the CI team was to define and reach agreement on roles 
relative to the 37 items identified during the project.  We have gathered all 
the Regional UAF teams input and now need to reach consensus with the other 
organizations.

EOTT UAF 
I met with Dave Daigle, Jim Martel and Don Doerr this past Tuesday.  I 
believe we have agreement on report generation, timing and distribution such 
that EOTT gain (loss) reporting can roll into the gas UAF reporting.
I  will reduce the agreement / process to paper as soon as I get a chance.

Training Project for  Phil Lowry  (Dave Schafer)

A meeting has been set up with Phil for 11/7/00 to review the data we have to 
date.
David Marye has done a fine job of putting together the data.

MISC:
I have spent a fair amount of time this week digging out data for various 
looks as TW UAF and its possible contribution to revenue.  I still have some 
questions I need to resolve.  Terry Galassini and I will be reviewing the 
data today.

Dill finally dust off Lodi and get going!  Wow!  I shouldn't have joined the 
evil empire quite so fast!

Seriously, congratulations on starting construction up in PA.  I ran into my 
old law partner Hill out in DC last week and got a great update on the recent 
battles against those drips at CNG and Penn Fuel.  Siggy, what are you going 
to do without Carol Lynn to fight with?????  Best wishes for continued 
success!  DF

CA Merchant Storage Plant Passes Major Test

     California regulators Thursday released a final environmental impact 
report for the
     state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the 
Sacramento
     Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding 
landowners,
     Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage 
project
     operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the 
approval process for
     environmental review. 

     Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project 
in Texas and
     it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in 
the Bakersfield area,
     according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. 

     Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of 
Sacramento should
     come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this 
summer and be
     operational before the end of the year. "We see the environmental report 
as the 'light at
     the end of the tunnel'," Fossum said. 

     Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California 
Public Utilities
     Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) 
identifying the
     project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then 
was circulated
     to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before 
the final
     report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were 
held by the CPUC
     last October. 

     Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative 
law judge
     for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period 
before the
     project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, 
a CPUC
     spokesperson said. 

     "We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already 
have our
     compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and 
that can go pretty
     quickly," Fossum said. "In the best of all worlds it would be this year; 
in the worst case,
     it would be a year from now." 

     Western Hub has some of its customers lined up, and it is in current 
discussions with
     others, said Fossum, declining for competitive reasons to even identify 
the types of
     customers, although they are expected to be large shippers, marketers, 
power plant
     operators and other large industrial customers. 

     The Lodi project is designed for full operation as having a 12 Bcf 
working capacity,
     with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacities. It will 
be
     connected to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone transmission system 
through a
     35-mile pipeline consisting of three miles of 30-inch-diameter and 32 
miles of
     24-inch-diameter pipe. During the past year's delay in start-up, Western 
has "moved
     the pipeline around a bit, but not a whole lot," Fossum said. "to make 
accommodations
     to nearby farmers." 

     Western Hub's similar-sized Texas project is south of San Antonio and 
would be
     connected with three natural gas transmission systems in the area: 
Houston Pipeline,
     PG&E --- Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
"We
     expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 

     Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
the Bakersfield
     area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
expects to have
     more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
California project
     moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 

     Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
have to connect
     with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
The combined
     Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area.

For those of you who didn't have the patience/patriotism to listen to your 
president for the whole hour and a half last night, let me share a 
highlight:  Clinton announced a new $1 billion program for economic 
development on the reservations.  Langley may be onto something.  If he/we 
can get the first deal done in New Mexico and assuming Gore wins, there may 
be opportunities to replicate the deal elsewhere.  I'm thinking of tribal 
lands in Minnesota, Wisconsin, S. Dakota, etc.  Perhaps Bill should call 
Chairman Ken and talk to him about changing sides.  Notice that I'm not 
volunteering to make that phone call. DF

Subject: Re: Pueblo  

Thanks for the extremely helpful analysis Steve and John.  I'm getting a 
pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently 
configured.  Just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of 
observations for the group to react to, along the lines of Steve's "However" 
section of his memo:

1.  Running this thing as a baseload unit won't work.  The fuel cost is a 
killer.  However, I keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 Corners spot price 
someone mentioned on the phone.   Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to 
support a peaking merchant plant?  How often are those types of opportunities 
available, and could a power plant in Alb. capture that upside by 
transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system?  
  
2.  We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant.  
Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE/DOD 
electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor.  I think we have all 
assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell 
surplus power into the grid (either at 4 Corners or, after N.M. elec. 
restructuring, into the Alb. area).   I just found the numbers I was 
remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual 
1998 consumption was 334.5 million Kwh.  By my lawyer-math, that is about a 
60% load factor for DOE.  If the DOE load is only 60% L.F., and the plant 
only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that 
arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds 
some benchmark rate ($.05/Kwh?  $.10/Kwh?  higher?)  the plant might run at a 
30-40% load factor on an annual basis.  The question is can we reduce the 
capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit?

3.  Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand 
charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., DOE) but sold the rest of its output 
into the grid only when profit opportunities arose?      

4.  If the answer to 3. is no, would ENA backstop the debt financing by 
signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what 
the government needs?   At what price?  Based on its knowledge of volatility 
and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners, and future profit 
opportunities that will be available in Albuq. is that just a dumb bet, or 
would ENA get interested if someone else (i.e., DOE) split the risk and 
reward?  

John, how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a 
way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley?  If we pull the plug on the 
project, I'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our 
information on why the turbines we would use can't provide acceptable 
economics.  I don't expect that we'd want to disclose the swap value analysis 
in Steve's memo, however.  

Thanks again, and I'd appreciate anyone's reaction to the above questions.

Subject: Re: Pueblo  

John's proposed plant costs are consistent with what we have seen for our 
ongoing LM6000 development.   I have priced 130 MW at Four Corners  assuming 
Permian gas plus 50 cents for transport.  This also assumes $4.70 per MWh for 
O&M and an 8000 heat rate.

For an hourly 7x24 product, the intrinsic value of the gas-power swap is 
$52.5 million on a 20 year deal, well below the $108 million estimate of 
constructing the facility.  A ten year swap is worth only $42 million (NPV = 
-66 m ).  That implies a market mid-price of $34 per MWh levelized over the 
period.  

Using the ENA Power and Gas structuring model and curves, we can determine 
the following:
1.  New build gas turbines cannot compete against the New Mexico market on 
price.  
2.  LM6000 CCGT efficiency gain does not pay for HRSG and ST over a ten year 
period.

However:
1.  Transmission constraints could create market value in Albuquerque that 
does not exist at Four Corners.
2.  ENA's power prices typically undersell the market.
3.  Commodity pricing does not accurately value capacity or reliability in 
constrained markets.

If Enron wants to do a deal in Albuquerque, we should be selling capacity and 
reliability.  Given the number of power- critical industries in the area, we 
could look at siting several remote units at different locations in the 
city.  Numerous chip manufacturing facilities and the Kirtland base could 
support several LM6000's for power reliability that is specific to their 
installations.  

I might also suggest that peaking units would have advantages over CCGT 
units.  Existing generation already provides ample baseload supply, however, 
the production of peak and intermediate energy is not necessarily well suited 
to existing units.  LM6000's have exceptionally good ramp rates that provide 
real value to a utility customer.  Not only can the HRSG/ST hinder the 
flexibility of the units, it can add substantial capital and operating 
expense with little real market benefit.  

We should also explore the ability to schedule load.  If the DOE wants to 
peak for a test, would it be willing or able to schedule a test for the 
off-peak hours?  Under those circumstances, we might be able to cut them a 
break on power and provide reliability of supply.

Bill,

Yesterday, we decided to look at two options for Pueblo; a 60 MW case and a 
140 MW case.  In order to match these outputs as closely as possible with 
available equipment, I made the following selections:

Case 1
Equipment     3 X GE LM 2500 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 22 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   67 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  73.4 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  8170 Btu/kWh (HHV)

  
Case 2
Equipment     3 X GE LM 6000 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 44 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   130 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  143.7 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  7900 Btu/kWh (HHV)

There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized 
the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F 
for estimating power sales.  I have attached files that show the build-up of 
the estimated EPC price for the plants. 

The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file 
attached.  The projections are based on:

70% debt financing at 10% rate.
10-year project and debt life.
8500 hours per year at average output (97% capacity factor).
Gas at $4.40/MMBtu.

The results turn out pretty much as anticipated.  Even with the larger plant, 
we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.

Presenters:  Pat Brennan and I attended the Virtual Power meeting this 
morning representing Regulatory.  Drew and Dari were there from law.  Drew 
led the presentation and covered the matrix/template that out study group 
submitted earlier.

Audience:  Rockey Storie, Kevin Hyatt, Bob Burleson in Houston.  Kent Miller 
and Tim Johanson in Omaha.

The material, presentation and discussion was well received and timely.  
Rockey indicated that, in a recent status meeting with Danny McCarty, Danny 
had asked if the commercial people were discussing their proposed deals with 
Law and Regulatory.  Rockey responded that there had been contact and 
discussion under way. 

As for the discussion, the audience easily and quickly picked up on the 
template format with most of the questions/comments focusing, as one might 
expect, on revenue/COS bottom line issues.  Pat was able to provide 
additional definition and comment to the group discussion and template 
display.

Dari led us through the "jurisdictional" issues regarding electric and gas 
service.  The abandonment of service concern that we expressed at the study 
group meetings was more or less put to bed when Marketing responded that, 
based on field operations input, turn-around time to stop a turbine, engage a 
different operation (e.g., run a compressor) could be accomplished in 1 -2 
hours.  "Gearbox" technology to shift operations is available.  We also 
touched on the jurisdictionality issue associated with the purchase of a 
compression service  - ala monetization.

Other concepts were brought up with regard to deal structure and financing 
alternatives but were tabled for the moment.  There was also a question, to 
be pursued, regarding air quality/permits using the engine to compress for 
natural gas service vs running a generator.

I really feel that the meeting was successful and appreciated in that, at the 
least, we were able to congeal much info on the matrix and facilitate what 
could have been a very lengthy discussion into a relatively brief meeting.  
Drew concluded by stating that the template should not be distributed outside 
ETS.  He suggested that, on a case-by-case basis, our study group of Legal 
and Regulatory personnel could quickly respond to case specific issues in a 
customized response that the commercial dealmaker could provide to their 
client(s).

Enron's stock was off $3-3/16 or 4.1 percent in afternoon trading at $74,
following an announcement that Jeff Skilling will become its new chief
executive officer on Feb. 12. An analyst, who asked not to be named, said
that it had been widely assumed that Drew Fossum would be named CEO;
therefore, the company's stock traded lower on the news.

Subject: Capacity Options on TW

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

Subject: Caithness Big Sandy LLC

TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20" pipeline.

Next Steps (responsible party/department)
 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Pipeline Alignment
1. Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route.     8/4  Matthews/Chanley
2. Engineering services agreement    8/4  Scott/Fawcett
3. Final alignment sheets.    8/25  Matthews/Chanley

Misc. Items
1.   Confidentiality Agreement   7/24  Scott/Fawcett
2. Data items to Caithness
 -  Form 567     7/26  Matthews
 -  Gallup FERC filing (flow diagram)  7/26  Scott
 -  Sta. 1 and Needles flow/pressure data  7/28  Matthews
 -  Outage reports/maintenance schedules 7/28  Matthews

Engineering/Design
1.   Original estimate (16" line) to Caithness  7/24  Matthews
2.  Revised specifications to Transwestern  7/28  Caithness (T.P.)
3.   Revised estimate (20" line) to Caithness    8/4  Matthews/Chanley 

Other Issues
Several key issues need to be addressed concurrently with the pipeline 
alignment and engineering activities:

 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Deal Structuring
1. Financing/cost amortization     9/8  Fawcett/Hayslett
/Centilli/Goodrow
2. Research interconnect policy (EPNG)    8/4  Scott/Regulatory
3. Research 7(c) application requirements  8/11  Scott/Regulatory
4. Rates      9/22  Scott/Regulatory
/Centilli
5. Research open season requirements  8/18  Scott/Regulatory

The above list is certainly not meant to be all-inclusive and a kick-off 
meeting to discuss the project schedule will be put together shortly.  In the 
meantime, if you have any questions regarding this project, please let me 
know.  Also, please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I've 
inadvertently left off the distribution.  Thanks.

Rob Marvin of Inside FERC called for Mary Kay today with a couple questions.  
I reviewed them with Mary Kay and reported back to him.  He wanted to know 
what "Settlement Amount" and "Net Settlement Payment Due" meant on the 
schedules.  I told him "Settlement Amount" was the Kansas ad valorem tax 
refund obligation due under the Settlement, and that the "Net Settlement 
Payment Due" was what was remaining due if the producer had already paid 
money to Northern.  He then asked how the "Settlement Amount" was calculated 
and I told him that was subject to settlement negotiation privilege and that 
the parties agreed not to disclose any calculations or formulas in the 
Settlement.  Jrt

We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates 
haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little

Subject: Proposed Revisions to 2001 Plan O&M

In order to reduce net O&M by $7.9MM on NNG and $3.8MM on TW, I propose the 
following additions to overhead.  Per Rod, we will leave Gross O&M where it 
is and increase the overhead allocations.  These dollars will be added to the 
Capital Budget via an increased overhead rate.  Once finalized, I will 
calculate the new overhead rate and send it to you so we can add these 
dollars to the construction projects.

Please review this proposal and let me know by Friday if we need to make 
adjustments.  There is still a hole of $1.2MM on TW that we need to fill in 
order to cover the Environmental Remediation/PCB costs without reducing them.

I got a call from Tino Monaldo today passing on the results of Dennis 
Langley's meeting with DOE in Albuquerque.  DOE indicated that their current 
PNM rate is "5.3 cents, exclusive of the demand charge."  Tino's consultant 
claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of 
approximately 7 cents/KWh.  Assuming we need to come in at 10% less than the 
current rate, our bogey is 6.3 cents/KWh.  This is at the high end of the 
range we hoped they'd be in.

Additionally, DOE indicated that they need "redundancy" and don't want to 
rely on PNM for back up power.  They want a multiple turbine facility--i.e., 
more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines.  The new pipeline will 
need to be split connected to El Paso and TW in order to access diverse 
supplies and guard against supply failure.  They have not asked for fuel oil 
backup.  

I know this is starting to look like the project that won't go away, but the 
power price number looks very promising to me.  I think its worth scrubbing 
down the model we've used to replace the generic capital cost and O&M 
assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine 
configuration we'd be using.  

If this price is really as favorable as I think, can we make another run at 
the ENA people and Federal Solutions guys to see if they have any interest?

 First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who 
were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done 
today.  As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal 
Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts.  This thing went from 
Dave and Kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a 
(slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream 
sales.   Great job!   Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have 
come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done 
in the future.  The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the 
sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis.  If Gas Control verifies 
that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps 
get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate.  Gas Control 
should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented 
if the need ever arises.  Today's deal is a great example of that as we 
actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure 
management issues.  If there are ever any questions about when such deals are 
appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, 
Susan, or Maria a call.  Again, great job!  DF

Subject: TW Fuel

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at 
downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to 
tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those 
receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines 
unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that 
make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That 
latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should 
resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell 
it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was 
that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that 
gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement 
(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the 
transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest 
upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when 
ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than 
Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where 
they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling 
that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around 
whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct 
way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt 
points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes 
line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of 
reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move 
to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage 
line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, 
and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. 
border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack 
back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are 
consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line 
pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I 
can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with 
this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK 
with you?  DF

Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi=
ng
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ=
ers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countri=
es
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market=01*which once it has fully privatized will repre=
sent
an arguably larger market than the United States=01*Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europ=
e
to, as it says, "play an increasingly important role" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4 billi=
on
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by "focusing on international markets."

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why=01*the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable decisi=
on
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merge=
r
strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any "link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals." French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips=20
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil=20
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategi=
c
contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas tradin=
g
and distribution activities in particular=01*along with its electricity=20
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion=01*would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci=
al
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron Japan=
's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includin=
g
Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan=
ies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the "big catch" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both=20
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealin=
g
to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closel=
y
may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of "thou doth protest too much." Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

A consideration is being given to a plan which could provide an additional 7 
reserved parking spaces for employees in the Omaha parking garage.  However, 
before we undertake any work or effort to make these spots available, we 
would like to know if there is any interest by employees to obtain a reserved 
parking space ($30/month).

Please respond back via E-mail no later than Friday, November 17.  We will 
evaluate the response and determine whether to implement the new parking plan.

We are now addressing the distasteful task of sorting through the mountain of 
files accumulated during the Conoco litigation.  Kathy is taking the lead on 
reviewing our document retention policies and advising Britt and I of what 
she thinks we can destroy and what we need to keep.  In some instances, the 
appropriate approach is not entirely clear.  Have you folks run across any 
"document retention policy specialists" that she ought to talk to?  We have a 
fairly detailed policy applicable to "Interstate Law" (which I guess means 
GPG law--the policy document is fairly old) but I'm less clear on what 
authority or right Legal has to enforce the doc. retention policy as to other 
groups.  Rod Hayslett suggested during Conoco that it would be good if Legal 
followed up now and then and made sure that pack rats were following the 
policy.   His comment arose from a little situation in which we were served 
with requests for "3 year plans" and Rod was displeased  to learn that some 
folks had kept old plans from 10 years ago.  He (and I suspect all of us) 
would be happier if that didn't happen again.  Any thoughts?  Thanks. DF

Subject: Southwest Gas Discount Amendment Changes

Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the 
deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas 
Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several  
minor "sentence structure" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been 
included.  

Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments 
immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596).  
The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter:

1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not 
necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff 
right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to 
discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts.

2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity 
release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates 
above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper.


Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent 
of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November 
through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area 
to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area.  
The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for 
the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT 
Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may 
also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis.

Hey -

I just found out there's a live web cam right down the block from the

If I go stand there at 1:30 central
 will you  take a look?


I'll send the address - I checked it out. It works.

Should we try it?

I just talked to Frank about my revised draft of the rehearing request.  
Susan, you will be pleased to learn that he has successfully talked me out of 
starting world war 3 with the FERC.  I've asked Frank (and Steve) to massage 
the draft to avoid a frontal challenge to FERC's disclosure policies and then 
to work with you to get it finalized. The plan is to carve out a limited 
exception to the normal disclosure rules given that the Gallup case is over 
and there is  no pressing need for disclosure in advance of the normal 
discount report filing.  Thanks.  DF

those "shit happens" situations like everyone seems to believe, rather than a 
situation where we may have a cause of action and some $$$ owed to us by 
someone.  DF

The note below was a portion of Terry Galassini's Weekly Report.  I wasn't 
sure if either of you have been a part of the test information.


**Gallup Compressor Station & Mainline Expansion
A field test was completed and initial results indicate a compressor 
efficiency around 80 - 82% which is within Cooper's guarantee.  A not to 
exceed cost of $3 Million was provided to Marketing for station modifications 
to facilitate an incremental mainline (West of Thoreau) firm capacity of 10 
MMcf/d.    Additional work by E&C to fine tune the not to exceed estimate is 
targeted for completion by December 8th.  The mainline expansion potential is 
directly related to Gallup since the discharge pressure must be increased to 
970 psig to achieve an additional 10 MMcf/d on the mainline.  The San Juan 
Lateral firm capacity would remain at 850 MMcf/d.

A map could be generated depicting the area within an estimated 8 to 12 hr.

The data utilized to generate the map would be taken from our annual FERC

Frank,

I had trouble getting the FAX to go but you should have it by now.  After you 
get it reviewed can you answer Drew's question regarding time you would like 
to have (ie couple of weeks vs the 2 days given)?

Drew,

Frank is in charge of Engineering Records for ET&S et al and will provide the 
maps you deem necessary.  We do not give out pressure information (even for 
these subpoena's as I understand it), is that a problem?

Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators
 
posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 

Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with 
FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 
922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide 
additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will 
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for 
firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate 
Program, the company said.

"A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system," said 
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest 
Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor 
stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, 
restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002.

I note in TW's bullets for 12-22 that TW did the "Cal Border Backhaul" deal 
with SW Gas.  The last I heard about it, the deal had cratered.  I had 
serious reservations about doing the deal as it was initially described to 
me, which included a Cal border sale of "surplus" gas and a backhaul for EES 
on behalf of SW Gas.  My probems were (1) the issue of possible or apparent 
affiliate preference and (2) the need for adequate documentation of "surplus 
line pack."   My last guidance was that a deal like this might be doable, but 
only if we could document the "surplus" and if Stan signed off on it.  What 
happened?  Does the deal involve EES???  Was that raised with Stan and 
Danny?  The bullets don't mention the identity of the "shipper" that the 
backhaul was done for.  Please respond.  DF

Drew, here is a draft of a letter responding to USGT's with regard to the 
unpaid invoice for alternate points.  Thought I would see if you have any 
comments before I pass it along to Mr. Fawcett.  With regard to my reference 
to our Errors in Billing tariff provision, I was torn between backing up my 
statement vs. pointing them to potentially troublesome language (ie "mutual 
mistake"), but figured they would ask for the tariff provision so I included 
it.  Also, Elsa really attacks us for not billing them previously so I 
thought I should address that.   Let me know what you think.

Rudi,

Below is ETS Risk Management Policy, which we would like Corporate to review 
before it is presented to management for approval and limit establishment.  I 
have also attached a 1st draft of the Risk Management Procedures and Controls 
that while not all are fully in place we expect them to be operational once 
transactional active increases. 

Rudi, who would be the person to check with on this policy.

In anticipation of potential litigation involving TW's operational 
activities, please prepare an analysis for me of the reasons for TW's sale of 
excess natural gas at the California border.  I am aware of several of these 
sales and have been  informed that excess pressure at the border is the basic 
reason for them.  I'd like a more specific explanation that includes the 
following information:
1.  What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make 
it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border?  
2.  What is the process that is followed to make such a determination?
3.  Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an 
operational sale is necessary?
4.  In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do 
those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to 
previous years?
5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision 
to make a sale is reached? 

Thanks for your attention to this request.  Please give me a call to discuss 
and please designate your response as "Privileged and Confidential, Attorney 
Client Privileged."

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Christmas pics?  Didn't you get the Christmas card with pics?  We shouldn't 
have outsourced the mail room function--quality control has gone to hell.  
Come to Omaha and hang out for a couple of days and I'll give you some pics 
in person!  DF

Seems to me they were looking for Flynn 10 years ago, too. I remember at
that time, Rod Merriam told me something about how the "FBI" was looking
for Flynn, at least according to his mom. I DO remember that he was filing
for bankruptcy in the mid-80's. Then he dissapeared. (Used to live in
Crystal, or New Hope or somewhere.)

Oh,....I got it. And a professional job it was, too. Notice that there is
no "send to" address. Only phone #'s.

Yeah- like I'm gonna call Jeff Hogue.

 Hey-  Where are the Christmas pics of "da goils"?

NiSource and Columbia Energy Group Complete Merger
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

NiSource Inc. and Columbia Energy Group received approval for their merger
from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are expected
to close their transaction today. The combined company will continue to
trade on the New York Stock Exchange as NiSource (NYSE: NI). Columbia Energ=
y
Group shares (NYSE: CG) will cease trading before the market opens Nov.
2.

ANALYSIS: It's been a long and rocky road, to say the least, for the $6
billion marriage between these two companies, which reportedly will create
the largest U.S. natural-gas distributor east of the Rocky Mountains. The
union started out as a hostile takeover in June 1999, when NiSource began
making several attempts to purchase all outstanding common shares of Columb=
ia
Energy Group (CEG). All of NiSource's offers were rejected by CEG. In fact,
up until just a year ago, CEG fiercely fought the takeover, claiming that=
=01*due
to financial and operational problems=01*NiSource was not an appropriate ma=
rriage
partner. However, after about eight months of offers and rebuffs (with
NiSource offering as much as $74 a share), Columbia Energy Group finally
consented to the $6 billion offer, ironically based on Columbia's February
2000 stock value of $72.60 a share and consequently lower than NiSource's
previous offers.

The merger creates a company that could gain a strong lock on the natural-g=
as
market in a corridor stretching from Texas to Maine. Merrillville, Ind.-bas=
ed
NiSource is a holding company (parent company to NIPSCO and Bay State Gas,
among several other distribution companies) with operations in electric,
natural-gas and water distribution in the Midwest and Northeastern United
States. Its generation portfolio includes four coal-fired generating statio=
ns,
two hydroelectric generating plants and four gas-fired combustion plants.
NiSource also markets unregulated energy services in key competitive areas.
CEG, based in Herndon, Va., is an energy services company with assets of
approximately $7 billion and ownership of 16,500 miles of interstate gas
pipelines that run from Louisiana to the Northeast. CEG is engaged in nearl=
y
all aspects of the natural-gas business, including exploration and producti=
on,
transmission, storage and distribution, as well as propane and petroleum
product sales and electric power generation.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, NiSource is offering 3.04 shares
for each Columbia common share. CEG shareholders can elect to receive New
NiSource stock, or receive a combination of $70 in cash plus $2.60 in=20
securities.
Just today, NiSource revised its estimate of the number of CEG shares elect=
ing
to receive NiSource stock upward to approximately 77 percent from its origi=
nal
estimate of 60 percent. Regarding current stock performance, NiSource share=
s
closed $24 15/16 on Oct. 31, not far from a 52-week high of $25 5/8. Shares
of CEG closed at $71 15/16.

Upon completion of the merger, the companies will create a new holding
company (as of yet unnamed) under which NiSource and CEG will become wholly
owned subsidiaries. Together, the companies will serve approximately 3.6
million customers. The companies have identified their post-merger strategy
as growth in "energy supply and distribution, as well as the development
of new energy choices through emergent technologies."

The regulatory approval process for the NiSource / CEG merger went=20
comparatively
smoothly, finishing just eight months after the formal announcement of
the merger. Yet, the SEC gave its approval to the merger on an important
condition. Under the laws of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of
1935 (PUHCA), the SEC has required NiSource to divest of IWC Resources,
its water operations subsidiary based in Indianapolis. Under PUHCA, utility
holding companies are required to divest operations that are not integral
to their primary operations. The divestiture must take place within three
years to comply with U.S. legislation, according to NiSource.

Although the merger is small in comparison to recent mega-mergers between
AEP / CSW and PECO / Unicom, this partnership is important. It's not=20
surprising
that NiSource pursued CEG so diligently, as the acquisition of CEG more
than doubles the size of NiSource and changes it from a predominantly elect=
ric
company to a gas transmission and distribution company with electric=20
operations.
NiSource will own a natural-gas business extending from Chicago to New
England, reportedly placing it as the nation's third-largest natural-gas
company (largest in the West). The completion of the merger comes at an
ideal time for NiSource, just as reports of a shortage in natural-gas suppl=
y
indicate that the prices for natural gas will rise significantly this winte=
r
and into next year. As a leading supplier, NiSource will be sitting in
a prime position.

However, the divestiture of IWC Resources is a clear downside to this merge=
r,
at least from NiSource's point of view. Of all the players that have=20
penetrated
the water industry and then retreated (for example, Enron and Duke), NiSour=
ce
was one of the few that stood out as having some success in this heavily
regulated market. In fact, up until recently, NiSource had claimed that
its growth strategy was to build a distribution chain around the core=20
natural-gas,
electricity and water distribution businesses. More than being a significan=
t
money maker for the company, NiSource's water business provided a steady
cash flow and, perhaps more importantly, access to additional energy=20
customers.
Water customers as an aggregated group can be very valuable for an energy
company. The company that controls water services has another stable base
of customers to which it can sell electric and gas services. For instance,
NiSource had purchased IWC in part to prevent its competitor, IPALCO=20
Enterprises,
from obtaining the water customer list in this service territory.

The bottom line of this merger may be that, while other companies are focus=
ing
on building critical mass, the New NiSource is carving out a specific niche
(natural-gas services) in a targeted market (Texas to Northeast). The fact
that it will no longer own IWC Resources may pale in comparison to the
projected growth that the New NiSource may find in the natural-gas business=
.
Of particular importance to this new company is the ownership of 16,500
miles of interstate gas pipelines gained from CEG. Owning a significant
supply of natural gas in a very tight market may become the real secret
advantage of this merger.

I think we do say that in the "to the extent we didn't get binding bids for 
all of the capacity" sentence.  With that clarification, I think we ought to 
get this posted and the letters out to shippers.  Susan--make it so.

Subject: Re: TW Fuel  

 First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who 
were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done 
today.  As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal 
Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts.  This thing went from 
Dave and Kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a 
(slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream 
sales.   Great job!   Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have 
come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done 
in the future.  The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the 
sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis.  If Gas Control verifies 
that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps 
get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate.  Gas Control 
should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented 
if the need ever arises.  Today's deal is a great example of that as we 
actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure 
management issues.  If there are ever any questions about when such deals are 
appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, 
Susan, or Maria a call.  Again, great job!  DF

Subject: TW Fuel

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at 
downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to 
tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those 
receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines 
unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that 
make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That 
latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should 
resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell 
it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was 
that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that 
gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement 
(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the 
transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest 
upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when 
ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than 
Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where 
they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling 
that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around 
whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct 
way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt 
points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes 
line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of 
reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move 
to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage 
line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, 
and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. 
border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack 
back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are 
consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line 
pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I 
can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with 
this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK 
with you?  DF

On Conoco, I would think athat drafts of the settlement agreement -- to the 
extent there could be future disagreement over what was done/meant, etc. 
might be important.  Otherwise, with agreements that are terminated/expired, 
the retention policy is to retain them for 10 years (last time I saw a 
retention policy on contracts, that is; also, the reson behind the 10 years 
was that, although the gen'l stat. of limit. in Texas was 4 years, the stat. 
of limit, in Nebraska was, I think, 6 years, and then some additional time 
was thought to be appropriate).

For copies of contracts, no retention period is required, as I recall.  Since 
you had outside counsel, they will likely retain all the documents from the 
case itself.

Subject: Document Retention

We are now addressing the distasteful task of sorting through the mountain of 
files accumulated during the Conoco litigation.  Kathy is taking the lead on 
reviewing our document retention policies and advising Britt and I of what 
she thinks we can destroy and what we need to keep.  In some instances, the 
appropriate approach is not entirely clear.  Have you folks run across any 
"document retention policy specialists" that she ought to talk to?  We have a 
fairly detailed policy applicable to "Interstate Law" (which I guess means 
GPG law--the policy document is fairly old) but I'm less clear on what 
authority or right Legal has to enforce the doc. retention policy as to other 
groups.  Rod Hayslett suggested during Conoco that it would be good if Legal 
followed up now and then and made sure that pack rats were following the 
policy.   His comment arose from a little situation in which we were served 
with requests for "3 year plans" and Rod was displeased  to learn that some 
folks had kept old plans from 10 years ago.  He (and I suspect all of us) 
would be happier if that didn't happen again.  Any thoughts?  Thanks. DF

Great!  We've got a meeting set for 9 am on Wed on the regulatory structure 
of the pipeline.  Also, I talked to Kevin and Tim separately today on the 
market research issue.  I think Tim could probably identify the specific 
electric rate PNM charges DOE at Sandia and DOD at Kirtland as well as the 
general tariff rate for large industrial service.  If we are lucky, there 
might be some info in PNM's last rate case on the discounted electric rates 
it gives specific large industrials (if any).  Obviously, any info on gas or 
elec. loads and rates would be useful.  Kevin, I told Tim you'd give him a 
call to convey further thoughts, but this is probably enough to get Tim 
started.

I got a call this afternoon from Tino.  He asked our help on right of way 
issues with BNSF.  Could Steve, Kevin or Lorraine take point on trying to 
find out if we or anyone within Enron has a good contact at BNSF that we 
could use?  Lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid 
tipping PNM that Enron is involved.  Just in general on the confidentiality 
issue, Tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind--the 
current leglislative session in Santa Fe ends Feb. 17.  We need to be 
absolutely sure that we don't tip PNM off that we are talking to Langley 
before then so we don't get them interested in the leglislative fix we are 
supporting on the Plains-Tri State merger.  Tim believes PNM could spike that 
leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to.  That issue is real 
immediate dollars, so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal 
(even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation).

Tino had a new fact to work into the economics:  DOE has 6000MMBtu/d of pure 
gas load at Sandia in addition to elec. load.  No number yet on Kirtland gas 
load.  Also, Tino has heard that a guy named Jeff Sturba will likely replace 
Montoya at PNM before the end of the year.  Has anyone else heard that?  Do  
we know him?     

I told Tino that one of us would give him a call back by the end of the week 
just to report in on our analysis.  At minimum, we can probably pass on the 
name of a contact at Enron Wind for Tino to bother on the windmill thing.  
Turned out that the wind pilot project is on the Rosebud reservation in S.D. 
and has nothing to do with the Albuquerque project anyway.  Sorry about the 
random message but thats how my brain is working today.  DF

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

--ONLY THELAW.NET DELIVERS THE LAW AND THE NET TO YOUR DESKTOP

     The list of critical Internet-only resources that appear nowhere on West 
and Lexis' radar--buried under the weight of two billion web pages--is 
exhaustive. Attorneys, paralegals and librarians know this. That's why we are 
always hunting and pecking around online in search of resources that we are 
sure must be there...if only we could find them. But the stark reality is 
that:

--in its raw form, the Net looks like a library with the books all over the 
floor
--getting around online is a big hassle, even for experts
--it makes no sense for everyone in the law office to be wasting time 
negotiating their way around the Internet differently

     Until now, no end-to-end mass customization software solution for 
accessing web-based documents and databases has emerged for the online law 
office. Such standards and best practices have been a long time coming, but 
they are here today and affordable to all with TheLaw.net.

Oh, wait a minute--I was thinking current prices, not April-Oct. prices.  Is 
the basis  for that 7 month period below max rates?

Latest Tino-gram:  Apparently high power prices at 4 Corners have DOE excited 
about the project all of a sudden.  The latest configuration is in the 
300-380 mw range.  Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested 
in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are 
basically tolling agreements--ENA would pay a monthly capacity reservation 
charge per KW of capacity and then pay actual fuel and variable cost for 
power that is actually dispatched)  $7/kw if the thing is simple cycle or 
$10/kw if combined cycle.  Variable cost would be $.005/kwh and fuel is 
whatever it is--ENA's problem.   I'm trying to get ahold of Tino to confirm, 
but I think these are prices at the plant, not FOB 4 Corners.  

Please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ENA 
guys.  Thanks.  DF

Thanks Brian.  I'd delete ", oil and gas pipeline" and replace it with 
"utility" at the end of line 3 to make it a bit broader.  Also, I've run this

Tino called this morning with a quick report.  They are still negotiating 
with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.  The size of the 
plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.  Tino has been 
ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls 
apart.  He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it 
related to the pipeline right of way.  The have a binding 20 year agreement 
with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly 
payment.  I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the 
ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  The question is whether we 
are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis 
has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  I 
told Tino I'd give him a call next week to let him know.  At minimum, I'd 
suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they've got and 
advise us on what its worth.  Your thoughts?  DF

Good morning, everyone!

Many of you have called or emailed me about Lexis and Westlaw Luncheon 
invitations I sent with past dates.  Those were sent by Andrew Wu to you last 
night.  Andrew Wu is in EES Legal.  Last night, his emails in his inbox were 
altered to "send" status and you all received my old emails about various 
Lexis and Westlaw lunchoen we already had in the past few months.   Enron 
Global Messaging Center is aware of the problem and will fix it soon.  I 
apologize for the inconvenience and confusion it has caused you.   But I 
learn that many of you are interested in Lexis Cyberlaw training.  I'll 
coordinate with Lexis Corporate Attorney to do one in the near future.   I 
will send out invitation when I have the date scheduled.

Thanks,

Subject: Erroneous Messages sent by Andrew Wu/HOU/EES on Wednesday, October 
25th

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will 
strive to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.


Thanks,

SCIENTECH IssueAlert, November 14, 2000
SmartEnergy Rounds Up $15 million in Financing; Is an IPO in the Works?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

SmartEnergy announced that it had completed its Series A round of financing,
having received funding from an investor group including strategic utilities,
venture capital and global banks. SmartEnergy, a privately held Internet-based
energy service provider active in New York, plans to use the funding as
working capital to "rapidly ramp up to meet an aggressive deployment 
schedule."

ANALYSIS: You may recall that I discussed SmartEnergy about a month ago
(IssueAlert, Oct. 11), when I drew attention to the fact that the online
start-up was taking customers away from ConEdison. In existence only since
April 1999, SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential
and small business customers. Under a promotion currently under way in
New York, SmartEnergy has guaranteed savings of up to 40 percent on energy
through the winter months for natural-gas customers in the boroughs of
New York City and Westchester County. Capitalizing on ongoing threats about
low supplies of oil and natural gas, SmartEnergy is using the so-called
"energy crisis" to lure customers away from the traditional utility by
locking in current natural-gas rates over the course of the next 12 months
under its "Smart Fixed Rate" plan. As a policy, SmartEnergy hedges the
products that its sell to customers, so that neither the company nor its
customers is exposed to energy market price risks. In addition, SmartEnergy
has offered 500 United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles as an enticement
to secure customers.

As I discussed last month, an advantage that online energy providers such
as SmartEnergy have over traditional utilities is their agility. As utilities
try to disengage themselves from regulatory-bound rate structures, online
companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products
and billing options to customers. In addition, operating online allows
SmartEnergy to easily operate in geographically disparate markets. Up until
now, SmartEnergy's marketing efforts have been concentrated in New York
state. However, the company claims that it will be serving six states,
including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, by the end of this year. SmartEnergy
expects to be serving all 25 deregulated states by the end of 2001, and
the financing that it has received from investors undoubtedly will support
this anticipated growth.

Venture capitalists apparently agree that a company like SmartEnergy offers
a unique business model that could potentially lead to financial returns
as the energy industry continues to become deregulated. Investors that
are bankrolling SmartEnergy include Alliant Energy, WPS Resources Corporation,
Avian Securities and several other unidentified private investors. In 
addition,
there is a European contingent that is part of the Series A round, including
Dexia Ventures, the private equity arm of Dexia Bank, a USD $211 billion
asset bank based in Belgium; KBC Bank; and venture capitalist groups Trust
Capital, Proseed Capital Holdings and Technoledge Ventures. The inclusion
of both American and European investors is important. Coupled with 
SmartEnergy's
intention to operate in all 25 U.S. states that are deregulating, the fact
that the company also has European investors suggests that SmartEnergy
plans to be an energy provider on both sides of the Atlantic. The fact
that SmartEnergy operates completely online lends itself to a platform
of worldwide service. In fact, Alliant Energy identified "the strong growth
of the Internet and technology in the energy segment" as a key reason why
it is financially supporting the growth of SmartEnergy.

In fact, the alliance between SmartEnergy and Madison, Wis.-based Alliant
has been in existence for several months. The utility's non-regulated 
subsidiary
Alliant Energy Resources formed a strategic partnership with SmartEnergy
to expand a decidedly e-focused business. The partnership with SmartEnergy
represents Alliant's new drive to forge strategic alliances with companies
offering state-of-the-art technology and new products and services for
customers. In fact, Alliant has referred to SmartEnergy as "the energy
company of today and tomorrow" and believes that it has a platform that
can be replicated for fast growth in markets around the world.

Of course, my question is whether or not we are seeing the wheels turn
toward an imminent IPO from SmartEnergy. It would certainly be an obvious
move for the private company to head in this direction, especially now
as technology stocks are being received favorably by Wall Street. I've
written pretty extensively over the last few weeks about companies like
Evergreen Solar, Active Power and Capstone Turbine all issuing very solid
IPOs as a result of, in my opinion, their business models in new technologies
and / or alternative fuels. There is arguably a general perception within
the financial community that energy companies incorporating new technologies
into their business models will gain an increasingly strong lock on the
energy market in the next two years. With few exceptions, energy companies
exploring new technologies that have issued IPOs over the last several
months have performed comparatively well.

As commercial and industrial customers want various service options that
reduce their dependence on traditional utilities and the transmission grid,
start-up companies like SmartEnergy might find a very profitable niche.
Perhaps the greatest marketing edge that SmartEnergy has is its customer
service, again resulting from its online presence. Customer interaction
can be conducted via the telephone or over the Internet, enabling 24/7
account access and the ability for customers to check their accounts at
any time.

The downside, of course, is customer reluctance to sign up with a start-up
company that they may not know. In addition, SmartEnergy faces tough 
competition
from other online energy providers that also are gaining momentum in 
deregulated
markets, including Utility.com and Essential.com. None of these companies
has yet gone public, and are instead focusing on building critical mass
and establishing their brand identities. Yet, of the three, SmartEnergy
may be the most aggressive in terms of expansion, and could be on the fast
track to an IPO in the near term.

In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list 
of Transwestern's "major" shippers to California with contact names and phone 
numbers.  I've defined "major" as anyone with total firm contracts of 
25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Thanks,

Here's one for you to chew on for awhile.  As we approach the transition to a 
new organizational structure in ET&S, let's rethink the role and competencies 
of the legal department.  I'd like each of you to answer the following 
questions and circulate your answers to me and each other.  To avoid having 
anyone's answers unduly influenced by anyone else's, please send your 
responses at 12 noon on Thursday.  No, this isn't being graded, and doesn't 
affect the PRC process or any other process.  I just want to get access to as 
much original thinking as possible.

1.  What is the ET&S law dept. currently best at?  (give one example).  

2.  What is the ET&S law dept. currently worst at?  (give one example).

3.  Without regard for any past objectives, what should our top 3 objectives 
be?  (make these very specific--objectives like "We should manage legal and 
regulatory compliance and optimize shareholder value"  don't cut it).  

Thanks for your responses.  DF

Excellent idea!!  There is ample opportunity for all three of us in the hot 
air business.  I talked to Dave yesterday and I think this is a great fit for 
him.  He's back to doing what he does best--convincing investors and 
customers to pour money into a hole in the ground!

I was in Houston Wednesday and got a chance to catch up a little with the 
hooker&cooker tandem.  You may know that David has started into a new venture 
selling either compressed air or energy from compressed air (he's not sure 
which yet).  We agreed that his only concern is that you might want to enter 
the market because with all your hot air, the market would be saturated!

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Just wanted to communicate that I contacted Drew earlier today to suggest that
we check the pricing and execute the Conversion Agreement for Gallup.   As you
guys know, the recent price valuation for deliveries associated with Gallup 
have been 
well below the earlier market quotes.  

 Given the short term market reaction to the colder weather, we may be able 
establish
prices similar to the earlier market quote.   Based on the response from Dave 
and Drew
I have requested the pricing and hope to have that information by mid-day 
tomorrow.

would they buy an intrastate, CPUC-regulated storage project??  Maybe to

 Tino called today to report on their meetings with DOE last week.  Tino, 
Dennis Langley, and their outside lawyer Jim Slattery met with Bill 
Richardson and DOE staff to discuss the "sole source" procurement approach to 
DOE's obtaining an alternative power supplier for Kirtland AFB and Sandia.  
Tino reports that Richardson signed off on the sole source approach, subject 
only to DOE review of the final contract to assure its consistency with the 
public interest.  Tino believes that the combination of significant Native 
American involvement in the overall deal structure along with a power price 
that is lower than DOE's current PNM rates will satisfy the "public interest" 
standard.  

 Slattery is set to begin discussions with DOE next week on the overall 
structure of Dennis' proposal.  I am surprised that Dennis would go this far 
before hearing from us on the economics, but Tino made it sound like the 
initial discussions would be fairly general--i.e., to explain to DOE that the 
plan is to build a new pipeline and a new power plant and to do the whole 
thing in partnership with the Isleta Tribe, but without talking about 
specific economic issues.  Sounds to me like Dennis has Richardson on board 
but is nevertheless planning to pitch to the lower level DOE staff people 
what a great deal this is for the Tribes and therefore the government.  

 Tino, not surprisingly, is eager to see numbers and sit down to discuss 
them.  He suggested a meeting the first week of May in either Houston or KC.  
I asked Tino whether he could get firmer numbers from DOE than we currently 
have on (1) total electric and gas load (current and projected) for the AFB 
and Sandia and (2) actual price DOE currently pays for gas and power.  He 
didn't think he could get better information before the first week in May.   

 On another related topic, through Shelley Corman's group  I got acquainted 
with a guy named Tim Beldon who runs the ENA transmission capacity book for 
the Western U.S., out of Portland.  I talked with him for a few minutes about 
power flows and pricing in the N.M-Arizona area and he seemed pretty 
knowledgable.  He has a transmission engineer on his team who is an expert in 
verifying utility claims of transmission constraints.  Apparently, ENA buys 
and sells a lot of power in the four corners area and is pretty familiar with 
the transmission availabilty and power pricing situation up there.  I didn't 
discuss with Tim the specifics of the project we are looking at, but did tell 
him that Kevin and Steve were looking at a potential power plant load and 
trying to figure out how serious it is.  Kevin, if you guys think Beldon 
could provide useful info on the cost and availability of firm and non-firm 
transmission for the surplus power out of Albequerque up to four corners, 
please give him a call.  It is OK to disclose to Beldon what we are working 
on, but please inform him that we are subject to a confidentiality agreement 
and that further disclosure is improper.  

Please let me know whether a meeting with these guys the first week of May is 
doable.  Thanks.  DF

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

The note below was a portion of Terry Galassini's Weekly Report.  I wasn't 
sure if either of you have been a part of the test information.


**Gallup Compressor Station & Mainline Expansion
A field test was completed and initial results indicate a compressor 
efficiency around 80 - 82% which is within Cooper's guarantee.  A not to 
exceed cost of $3 Million was provided to Marketing for station modifications 
to facilitate an incremental mainline (West of Thoreau) firm capacity of 10 
MMcf/d.    Additional work by E&C to fine tune the not to exceed estimate is 
targeted for completion by December 8th.  The mainline expansion potential is 
directly related to Gallup since the discharge pressure must be increased to 
970 psig to achieve an additional 10 MMcf/d on the mainline.  The San Juan 
Lateral firm capacity would remain at 850 MMcf/d.

Subject: LG&E issue

Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law 
bullets this morning.  A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and 
Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).  LG&E's 
gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into 
Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.   Rockey 
and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good 
arguments for avoiding the liability.  The unexpected (and unmetered) 
deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance 
during the referenced 3 month period.  Accordingly, I assume the cost of 
replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should 
not affect earnings.   I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this 
matter.  DF

Subject: Gallup Station - Demand Rebate



Hey Drew,
 
Sorry that we did not get to meet last week when you were in town.  I have 
pulled up some information on the project performance and wanted to share 
with the group.  I was very concerned by the comment that the project was on 
a rate to cost TW an additional $1.0 million for the year because the demand 
avoidance program was not in place.  I do want to confirm that Arnold 
Eisenstein at ET&S working on the development of the programming to support 
TW's efforts to minimize demand expenses.  It was my understanding during the 
development of this project, that TW was targeting a 75% avoidance for an 
annual basis.   I offer the following details regarding the actual operation 
of the station in 2000. 

Peak load for 12,000 hp = 9,621 kw x 3 = 28,864.0 kw per Quarter

Actual Utilization
   3rd Quarter 2000      % of Max  4th Quarter 2000  % of Max
 kw - generation   22,684.8      78.6   17,779       61.6
 kw - transmission 25,421.0      88.1   22,992       79.6
 
 Target $'s @ 75% 99,142      75.0            73,480      75.0
 Net Actual Rebate  $'s 75,935        78.6                105,181        61.59
  difference            ($23,206)                  $31,702   

Overall net for 2000 under Rate 21 appears to reflect that TW has saved 
$8,496 above their target rebate of $170,622 (75% avoidance) for the 3rd and 
4th quarters.  In addition, ECS has made payment to TW under Rate 19 that 
resulted in an additional $118,441 paid to TW.   Note that ECS has proposed 
to included the transmission demand in the Rebate process which is not 
specifically addressed the Compression Service Agreement.  


Currently TW has access to the web site that graphically displays the current 
Tri-State generation load as well as several years of month by month 
history.  This access was conveyed to TW as soon as the confidentiality 
agreement between TW, ECS and Tri-State was executed and delivered to ECS.  
At this point, EE&CC (now under ET&S) was notified that the system access was 
available to package the load monitoring programming.  As I mentioned above, 
that effort is underway.  

I will be glad to meet and/or discuss these issues when you are available.  I 
will be travelling most of the next (2) weeks but you can reach me via email 
or my
cell phone (713) 851-7703.   Based on the information that I was able to pull 
together, I just don't see the magnitude of dollars that seems to have TW 
concerned.
I would like to discuss at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,
mk

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY
CONTRACT APPROVAL FORM


Please review the attached revised non-standard discount letter to Duke 
Energy Trading & Marketing (DUKE) and the associated letter from Transwestern 
to Duke which outlines the conditions of Transwestern's Contribution in Aid 
of Construction (CIAC) payment to Duke for certain facility upgrades.

The revised discount letter eliminates the reference to actual fuel 
(calculated at 1.5% for the EOT Area) which Duke shall provide to 
Transwestern.  All fuel which Duke shall provide Transwestern shall be at the 
Tariff fuel rate.  Bob Burleson has decided not to monetize the difference 
between actual fuel and Tariff fuel (difference being only .19%) and revise 
the rate given that the current economics of the deal already provide for a 
24% rate of return (not including any fuel retainage "value added" factor).

Transwestern shall pay Duke $750,000 for Duke facility upgrades in order to 
increase gas receipts into Transwestern from Duke's Artesia plant and Big 
Eddy gathering system by an incremental 20,000 Dth/d.  Duke shall 
subsequently subscribe to a five year transportation contract for 20,000 
Dth/d of East of Thoreau  (EOT) capacity at a $.05/Dth/d one-part rate 
effective November 1, 2000.    Duke has been given alternate receipt and 
delivery rights in Transwestern's EOT Area.  Duke has also been granted the 
ability to flow to California on an alternate basis at a total rate of 
$.09/Dth/d. 

Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  Please contact me at x5702 
if any questions arise.

If the condition in OneOk's release tied to KN's settlement is "simply 
unacceptable" to ONeOk, then there is no deal unless we simultaneously 
receive the $$ from KN and OneOk and simultaneously sign the agreements.  We 
will need to set up a closing type of event (not necessarily in one city, 
over the phone and fax is ok) and hold each other hostage until all the paper 
is signed and wire transfers received.  Just in case she's curious, my 
position is we don't sign the release until the wire transfer is in our 
bank.  They can take the risk of the deal falling apart at the last minute--I 
don't think we should.  DF

 <<KN Settlement Letter.doc>>   Tangie,  the attached file relects our
required changes, deletions and/or additions to the Settlement Agreement.
Mostly minor clarifications with the exception of Paragraph 2 (b), which is
simply unacceptable. KNGG will not agree to make it's settlement with NNG
conditional upon actions NNG requires from Oneok, which as you know, are
beyond KNGG's control.

                          If the revisions set forth within the attachment
are acceptable to NNG, please so advise. I will be happy to initiate a wire
transfer tomorrow if we can, at a minimum, exchange fax copies of the
Settlement Agreement.

Drew,

I have replaced you with both Dari and Tony in the routing system.  They will 
both receive all CAF's that would have come to you and should be able to 
approve them. 

Dari, Tony - if you have any problems approving let me know.  Unfortunately 
there is not a way at this time to split out north and south deals so you 
both will receive all general counsel level CAF's.   If this becomes a 
problem let me know and I will try to do something for you.  

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  

Thanks

Linda

Honestly,  Drew Fossum told me "If you build it, they will come".

Well, the ET&S Contract Administration Group has successfully reconfigured 
the contract file room in Houston to house any and all ET&S agreements in a 
secured environment.  But frankly, we are disappointed in the response that 
we have received to date.  We have only received a few documents from the 
Minneapolis Area Office and from Market Services in Houston.  Hopefully, the 
memo that I sent to you on April 7th was forwarded to your direct reports 
with instructions on providing any originals or copies of agreements created 
outside the CMS/CBS systems to the Contract Administration Group in Houston.  
If you would like me to forward this memo to you again, please let me know.

We have established contacts for all locations across ET&S to receive and log 
any originals or copies of agreements/documents given to them by department 
employees before forwarding them to the Contract Administration Group in 
Houston.  The contacts, who have already been notified of their role in this 
process, are:

  Department   Contact

  Marketing (Omaha)  Laura Lantefield

If you have not already done so, please forward the April 7th memo (or this

Subject: Re: Enron Gas Storage Deal Structure Working Notes for LRC  


I just wanted to clarify a few points mentioned in this diagram:  

1.  The reason that gain recognition may be precluded under the equity sell 
down if Enron maintains a guarantee is because guarantees are considered 
"continuing involvement" under FAS 66 : Sale of Real Estate.  We would 
essentially own an interest in an asset which is considered real estate (per 
accounting rules). By maintaining a guarantee, Enron has not given up all of 
the risks and rewards of ownership and therefore true sale treatment would be 
precluded.

2.  The lease versus executory contract  debate is centered around the nature 
of the offtake agreement coupled with our involvement in the project.  
Involvement that requires us to take operational risk coupled with taking 
capacity leans toward a lease.  However, each deal is different and there 
isn't a bright line test for determining lease vs. executory; although, it 
certainly looks better if our offtake is minimal.  As well, LD language 
should not only be present but should be significant or market based.  In 
addition, the contract should not mention the storage facility, only that 
capacity will be provided.  Determining whether we are in a lease versus and 
executory contract is based on a preponderance of the evidence (more facts 
pointing toward executory contract versus lease).

3.  In the General Notes section, you mention the Trust being funded by all 
debt and contribution to the project being considered equity.  I'm unsure 
where this conclusion was reached.  This is not something I believe we fully 
discussed.  Whether of not it can be funded by all debt is something I will 
have to digest and get back to you about.   How much money is coming in 
through the investment trust?  From the diagram is looks like Enron ownership 
would be 30% instead of 12% if that piece is considered debt.  30% ownership 
does not necessarily lead to consolidation of Project Co. LLC.  

4.  Two more items of interest that we did not discuss are our Affiliate 
Rules and FAS 98 Sale Leaseback.  Under our affiliate rules, if the capacity 
contract is deemed an executory contract and qualifies for MTM Accounting, we 
can only mark the portion of the contract we do not own.  So long as we 
maintain a 12% interest, we could probably only MTM 88% of the contract.  
However, there is debate in this area depending on our level of "control".  
Affiliate rules normally cover greater than 20% ownership investments unless 
we exert significant influence.  I believe we will be in control of the 
structure.  This will require more discussion later.

-FAS 98 Sale Leaseback is not a good place to be but is something to keep in 
mind.  However, we can be proactive and work toward keeping ourselves out 
lease land and structure this as and executory contract.

Per my request, please allow me sometime to digest this structure and consult 
with my colleagues.  I will be in touch.

Team

I have summarized in the margins of our DRAFT deal structure the "high level" 
issues that Gail Tholen, Jin and I discussed on Thursday.   These are 
preliminary guidelines and as our deal evolves and our partner's desires 
change, we will have to potentially address completely different accounting, 
regulatory and tax issues.     We hope to touch on some of the issues that 
this structure may raise from a Regulatory perspective with Drew Fossom when 
we meet next Tuesday at 10:00AM.  

Please comment and advise as you see fit.

Thanks

Subject: Re: TW  

I think the example of when quantities may be subject to transportation and 
fuel is when an Operator overpulls at a delivery point and then cashes out 
the imbalance, TW could be out the transport and fuel.  For example,  

  DP is SoCal/Needles: scheduled volume is 700,000/d
     actual volume delivered is 720,000/d
     imbalance is 20,000/d, SoCal owes TW
     TW collects transport & fuel on 700,000/d (bill on scheduled volume)
     SoCal cuts a check to TW for dollar value of 20,000/d
     TW doesn't collect transport & fuel on 20,000/d
  Payback in-kind doesn't have this problem:
     The 20,000/d transport gets scheduled at Needles, TW collects the 
transport & fuel      (bill on scheduled volume), but we physically give 
SoCal 20,000/d less on that day

Is this the correct example?  I'm copying Lynn Blair to verify.

agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

Believe it or not, we just received a 25 page cert petition to the Supreme
Court filed by Bath Petroleum.  As you will recall, the Second Circuit's
decision was an unpublished per curiam order.  Even more remarkable is that
Carter  Phillips of Sidlley & Austin signed the petition as counsel of
record.

I will send a copy to Patty.  We can talk next week about our brief in
opposition.

AES Expands Into South American Hotbed Columbia
By: Susan Kellogg, Issues Analyst

AES Corporation announced further international expansion through its=20
acquisition
of KMR Power Corporation ("KMR"), a privately owned electric power plant
developer and operator in Colombia, South America. KMR has controlling
interest in three natural gas-fired power plants having a total capacity
of approximately 600 MW.  AES will be acquiring two of the three natural
gas-fired power plants located in Cartagena  through a 100% interest in
the 314 MW TermoCandelaria power plant and a 62% interest in the 90 MW
Mamonal plant.

ANALYSIS: AES continues its "non-strategy" of acquisitions in the purchase
of KMR. In a recent interview with Dennis Bakke, AES CEO, I asked him sever=
al
times about AES "strategic plans," to which he answered, "We don't have
(one)."  Ideas often flow from the bottom up in the mega-power company
due to its decentralized structure.  Decisions are made in response to
a unique company mission which is "to serve the world and steward its=20
resources,
making clean, safe, reliable electricity available."

So why venture into Colombia, a hotbed of political and social upheaval
with an uncertain business environment? A risky business by many energy
companies' standards.  But AES has created a dramatic international network
guided not essentially by the almighty dollar, according to Bakke. "We'll
go anywhere we are needed, or wanted, and can live our values and principle=
s."

So, given its unique company policies and experience in South and Central
America, KMR is a prime target. AES is perhaps the most suited to successfu=
lly
penetrate the dictatorial climate of Colombia and spark a change as they
do what they do best =01* buy, command and redirect electric service from
that monopoly into a clean, reliable and democratically supported power
service.

AES has made headlines throughout the year 2000 with its continuing list
of acquisitions and development in countries including Chile, Bolivia,
Argentina, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, England, Tanzania, Venezuela,
Puerto Rico, Brazil, Bulgaria, Republic of Georgia, and most recently,
Oman.

The acquisition of the Venezuelan utility C.A. La Electricidad de Caracas
(EDC) captured the headlines for several months earlier this year. AES
was involved in what was billed as a "hostile takeover," in a process that
intrigued the energy community.

AES purchased approximately 35,529,500 American Depository Shares (ADSs)
- including ADS's subject to guaranteed deliveries, representing approximat=
ely
49% of the outstanding shares. Dennis W. Bakke commended the Comision Nacio=
nal
de Valores, the Venezuelan Securities and Exchange Commission, on its final
action to allow AES to extend its offer after several stressful attempts
to close the deal.  But Bakke said the action would send a strong positive
signal for foreign investment in Venezuela.

"We were hoping to serve that country and we thought we could do a lot
better job than was being done by EDC. We didn't give a second thought
about controversy. We knew this was the right thing to do."

Bakke maintains that Venezuela has been run by a handful of very wealthy
and powerful families for many years. AES has the clout, the money and
the mission to go in, shake things up and, in line with AES' goals,  "to
create a stronger economy, a more competitive society." The strategy in
Colombia appears to continue that focus in South America.

"We've made a lot of changes (in the company) and it's not only going to
change Venezuela, but I think it will make a big difference in the neighbor=
ing
states as well."

Bakke is irrepressibly enthusiastic about the AES mission, although admitti=
ng
that maintaining its lofty principles is a challenge.

"(Our position and principles) seem to always be under attack," said Bakke.
"I know of no other corporation in the world of any significance that sees
its role in the world the way we do. But, our purpose has grown over the
years and actually deepened as we've expanded further and further into
the world."

AES has had another winning year. A world leader in generation, its value
has doubled in the past year,  Generating assets include one hundred and
twenty-five facilities totaling over 44,000 MW of capacity world wide.


Can it continue balancing the tightrope of economic growth and philanthropi=
c
philosophy? So far, AES seems to have been "touched by an angel" in its
endeavors into areas where "others fear to tread."

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) concession that the

SCIENTECH IssueAlert, November 6, 2000
Evergreen Solar, Inc. Issues Successful IPO; Do Alternative Fuels Increase
Stock Value?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Waltham, Mass.-based Evergreen Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: ESLR) issued an initial
public offering of 3,000,000 shares of its common stock at the IPO price
of $14 per share. Evergreen Solar develops, manufactures and markets solar
power cells, panels and systems throughout the world. The IPO reportedly
will raise $42 million in gross proceeds to support further expansion and
development by Evergreen Solar.

ANALYSIS: Here's yet another case of a relatively unknown company going
public based on grand marketing ideas rather than a solid track record.
Yet, surprisingly, the IPO has opened strong. Last Thursday (11/2), Evergreen
Solar's stock closed 36 percent above its offering price, at $19.00. At
the close of the market on Friday, the stock price had dropped to $17 ?,
but still represented a strong showing while other IPOs last week (both
energy and non-energy) have crashed and burned (Excelergy, for example).


What makes the strong IPO even more startling is Evergreen Solar's 
less-than-stellar
financial history. Since its inception in 1994, Evergreen has incurred
significant net losses ($2.5 million in 1998, $2.9 million in 1999 and
$1.9 million for the first six months of 2000). As a result of ongoing
operating losses, Evergreen has a cumulative net loss of $12.3 million
as of June 30, 2000, and has stated clearly that it "expects to incur 
substantial
losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable." In
1999, product sales only accounted for 8.2 percent of total revenue, with
the rest coming from research grants. Granted, Evergreen is still in start-up
mode with regard to a large-scale production of its business, but still
it seems very odd to see such a strong IPO from a company that is really
just getting started.

So, what gives? Doesn't it seem logical that a company should demonstrate
financial stability before it goes public? And that if it's not financially
stable, the stock price should go down and not up? I'll provide one theory,
but first let's establish exactly what Evergreen Solar is all about.

The company's sales since 1997 have been composed primarily of solar panels.
Evergreen plans to begin large-scale manufacturing of its solar power products
in a new manufacturing facility in early 2001, a growth strategy that the
IPO proceeds obviously would support. Evergreen's principal objective is
to become a leading producer of high-quality solar power products, primarily
for the on-grid market and the off-grid rural electrification market. What
makes the company unique, according to Evergreen, is its String Ribbon
technology, which reportedly avoids the slicing of solid block of silicon,
which is required for most solar-power technologies. Evergreen's String
Ribbon technology reportedly cuts the use of silicon in half, which reduces
manufacturing costs without impairing product reliability.

In December 1999, Evergreen Solar formed a five-year strategic distribution
and marketing contract with Kawasaki for the Japanese market. Essentially,
Evergreen has agreed to sell its solar power products in Japan exclusively
through Kawasaki. In fact, the partnership constitutes the bulk of Evergreen's
business. In the first six months of 2000, sales to Kawasaki accounted
for approximately 70 percent of Evergreen's product revenues. After the
IPO, Kawasaki will have an 8.4 percent stake in Evergreen.

The risks associated with Evergreen's business are formidable, and the
company admits that its stock price could fall substantially if quarterly
revenue continues to be disappointing. Beyond that, Evergreen's success
hinges on the potential growth of the solar power market, which is still
in question. Evergreen contends that distributed generation technologies
(point-of-use electric generation that either supplements or bypasses the
electric grid) will be one of the most promising areas for growth in the
global electric power market, and within DG technologies solar power has
experienced significant growth over the last 20 years. In addition, solar
power produces zero emissions, and may grow as a result of renewable energy
requirements in various states.

This may be true, but at the same time there are other competing DG 
technologies
such as fuel cells, microturbines and wind power, which may slow the grow
of solar power. Plus, there's little proof that Evergreen's String Ribbon
technology will produce significant cost-savings to make it a standout
technology. There are other risks as well, not the least of which is the
exclusive relationship with Kawasaki. If the relationship goes sour, this
could dramatically diminish Evergreen's potential revenues and market share.

So, with this market profile, the question of why Evergreen had such a
strong IPO still remains. I think the answer is that Evergreen's business
focus is exclusively placed on alternative power. At a time when e-commerce
stocks are under growing pressure to demonstrate financial success, stocks
based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular
are being received particularly well by investors. There is arguably a
general perception within the financial community that distributed generation
technologies will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market
in the next two years. Commercial and industrial customers want various
options that can reduce their dependence on the grid. With regard to 
alternative
fuels and distributed generation technologies, investors may believe that
either utilities or large end-users will begin to develop these technologies
as deregulation continues.

Remember Active Power (Nasdaq: ACPW), whose shares soared on expectations
that flywheel energy storage devices will be a leading technology. On its
opening day in August, Active Power stock increased by 210 percent, from
the opening price of $17 to $51 1/8. Although Active Power's stock price
has bounced around since then, it still closed at $30 on Nov. 3, a very
respectable level and approximately 111 percent above its original price.
Another example is Capstone Turbine (Nasdaq: CPST), which is currently
trading at $45 3/8 after opening at $16 in June.

Along with alternative fuels, venture capitalists also appear to be responding
to technology startups that plan to provide software and related services
to energy companies. Then there is the growing market of exchanges, such
as Pantellos, Enporion, Enermetrix and the like, which could be the next
big round of successful IPOs.

The long-term question is how long such stocks can continue to open so
successfully, without having a strong financial performance to support
the opening. E-commerce stocks started opening strong about a year or two
ago, but began to take a downward decline this spring as investors demanded
to "see the money." Evergreen Solar and similar stocks may be following
a similar path, which makes time a critical factor. The bottom line is
that it is a real race for a company like Evergreen Solar to secure as
much funding as it can and grow its business while the financial climate
remains strong.

CEOs Speak on the Strategic Importance (or Lack Thereof) of Information
Technology in the Energy Industry

Four CEOs participated in a panel entitled the "CEO Mega Panel: View From
the Top" at the 48th annual EEI/AGA Energy Information Technology Conferenc=
e
in Phoenix this week.  The moderator was Charles Bayless, former chairman,
president and CEO of Illinova.  The remaining three CEOs included: Keith
Stamm, CEO, Aquila Energy; Dr. Matthew Cordaro, president and CEO, Midwest
ISO; and James Pignatelli, chairman, president and CEO, UniSource Energy.


ANALYSIS:  This panel was diversified in a very interesting manner. The
conference organizers did a good job in getting a cross-section of the
energy industry in transition.  The trading organization specialist was
represented with Aquila, the ISO specialist was represented with the Midwes=
t
ISO, and the vertically integrated utility was represented with UniSource
Energy.  Each panelist was asked what role information technology (I/T)
played in their respective organization.  Their answers may surprise you.

Dr. Matthew Cordaro of the Midwest ISO went first.  Dr. Cordaro stressed
that I/T was very critical to the operation of an ISO, saying "it is=20
essentially
the foundation of the ISO." He mentioned that the Midwest ISO had started
from scratch and would have to be able to handle hundreds of thousands
of transactions every week in a real-time operation.  Among the=20
responsibilities
that the Midwest ISO is entrusted with are: monitoring the congestion on
the grid and taking appropriate action, preventing gaming through market
monitoring, settlement processing (who owes who what), and handling the
dispute process.

The Midwest ISO signed a contract with the Regional Transmission Organizati=
on
(RTO) Alliance on July 20 of this year to deliver an integrated control
center system (ICCS) that, when complete, will provide $50 million in=20
infrastructure
for the MISO.  The RTO Alliance, which consists of ALSTOM ESCA Corporation
of Seattle, Open Access Technology International (OATI) of Minneapolis,
Perot Systems of Dallas, Texas, and TenFold Corporation of Salt Lake City,
Utah, will deliver an electricity transmission system that will enable
MISO to match electricity demand with available transmission. The hardware
and software in the ICCS project will support MISO's operational functions
including transmission planning, reservation, scheduling, real-time monitor=
ing
and control, settlement and billing.  Dr. Cordaro also stated that Lodestar
was involved in the MISO and that communications had been outsourced to
AT&T Solutions.

Keith Stamm of Aquila Energy went next.  Keith began by clarifying Aquila's
focus as trading: owning very little assets in a high-volume, low-margin,
high-volatility business.  I/T is very important in the trading business.
 Real-time information must be known and disseminated appropriately to
the right individuals.  Keith believes that one of Aquila's strategic asset=
s
and strengths is its risk management system.  Aquila strives for a real-tim=
e
calculation of risk.

Aquila Energy, a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United, Inc., has been a surprisin=
g
winner in the trading marketplace this year, showing a 113-percent growth
since last year with $9 billion total revenue for the past six months,
of that $55 million in trading revenue compared to $18 million in 1999.
The EBIT was $34.2 million vs. $9 million a year ago. Aquila has gathered
top traders and intellectual, financial, and risk management personnel
to enthusiastically participate in the power marketing race.

Keith mentioned a recent alliance with five other companies =01* including
top traders AEP and Duke Energy =01* as an investment step Aquila perceived
was necessary to keep pace with trader tycoon Enron and other online tradin=
g
platforms. The Energy Trading Consortium (Duke Energy, AEP, Aquila Energy,
Reliant Energy, Southern Company Energy Marketing and El Paso Energy) is
in progress to create an exchange that the participants hope will reap
benefits from the transaction cost, liquidity, volume and speed of exchange=
.
 This consortium differentiates itself from EnronOnline by bringing many
buyers and sellers to the platform as opposed to one-to-many.  Another
competitor recently launched is e-Speed's TradeSpark.

James Pignatelli of UniSource Energy went last and had some controversial
statements concerning information technology.  James stated that I/T in
the vertically integrated utility is not strategic, at least not at the
present time.  James believes that I/T will become strategic someday (in
the deregulated market).

James claims getting frustrated with platform switching in the I/T arena.
 He mentioned pulling in his I/T folks and saying, "Let's switch the=20
distribution
network to DC power and once the public has bought new appliances, we'll
switch back to AC." While James' comments may have been controversial with
the more than 500 attendees and approximately 50 energy CIOs in the audienc=
e,
he does have a point.  The vertically integrated utility's core strength
is to generate power and distribute it to "captive" customers reliably.
 While some I/T systems (like outage management and SCADA devices) may
be strategic in this sense, the other parts of I/T are questionable and
could be candidates for outsourcing.

James claims to be working on B-2-B and B-2-C initiatives at the moment.
 His vision for B-2-C is a smart chip in the residence that has access
to instantaneous pricing information.  The residence will "buy" electricity
for itself from the most efficient supplier and it will be able to reduce
load, thereby reducing the T&D utility to a simple conduit for service.


James and Charles Bayless both were involved in New Energy Ventures prior
to its sale to AES.  In 1997, Tucson Electric invested $3 million in NEV
and Charles Bayless (then Tucson Electric's chairman, president and chief
executive officer) and James Pignatelli (Tucson Electric's senior vice
president and chief operating officer) served on New Energy Venture's=20
administrative
committee.

It is interesting to view the different parts of the energy marketplace
as it unbundles and the profound impact that is occurring on the associated
I/T systems.  If one were to stop and think about it, deregulation could
not occur without the complex I/T systems that are employed today in the
marketplace.  I wonder what Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull would have
thought about an unbundled electric marketplace.  It is, in fact, undoing
their design of an integrated electric system constructed for operational
efficiency.

Subject: ECS Gallup contract: Update

I spoke with the person who administers the Members Only website at 
TriState.  I explained to her that we had been a customer under Rate No. 21 
since July but only obtained access recently.  She processes the request 
forms, and seemed to indicate that obtaining access is really a matter of 
routine.  She said we should have been able to get access as soon as we 
became a customer.  I told her we had signed a confidentiality agreement and 
she confirmed this was routine also.  I did not press her on the specifics of 
how ECS/TW obtained access, as I felt she had already given me enough 
information to tend to confirm our suspicions.  She was helpful, and had we 
known to contact her or someone in her department I feel certain we could 
have talked our way thru the red tape (if any really existed).

Subject: ECS Gallup contract

Here are some bullet points based on our conversation Friday morning 
regarding the ECS Compression Service Agreement.  These bullet points 
summarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a 
conversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined) 
regarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of 
the lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have 
additional comments, please let me know.  

We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that 
up to you, but do let me know if I can help. 

-  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a 
monitoring system that would automatically 
alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  

-  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission 
for TW to access the "Members Only" portion of CDEC's website (which contains 
load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a 
confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.

-  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on 
the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   "Good faith" 
by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any 
difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted 
in this regard.  

-  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load 
times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers 
with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this, 
but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have 
access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.

-  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July 
could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it 
did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information 
from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should 
therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.

-  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring 
system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the 
website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.

I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of 
the website; I'll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted 
"on a case-by-case basis."  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you 
know what I'm able to learn from them.

Subject: IT news from FERC

On Friday I attended an industry luncheon with Fernanda Young, FERC's Chief 
Information Officer.  She discussed some of the electronic filing and 
research changes coming to FERC.  The crux of the discussion is that within a 
few years (by 2003), FERC's internet website will include a searchable 
database that functions very much like Lexus/Nexus (except for the exorbitant 
fees).

For electronic filing, the first step begins tomorrow with comments (without 
service lists) being filed electronically.  Filers do not have to duplicate 
with a paper copy.  All filings, which can be received by FERC in almost any 
format, will be converted to Adobe Acrobat (.pdf files) by FERC for viewing 
online and available within minutes of being received.   The electronic PDF 
version will be the official copy for pagination citations.  The next round 
of filings to be accepted electronically will include interventions and 
protests.  Coming on line further down the road are documents with extensive 
service lists, as Fernanda is intent on cleaning up those lists of duplicate 
or "stale" names, companies and parties before going forward with electronic 
service of parties.  That process could be very involved, since each party 
will have to be contacted with a chance to respond before being removed or 
changed from a service list.

Another sticking point with major filings is the issue of electronic 
signatures, which is a security issue rather than a legal issue.  Electronic 
signatures demand the highest level of security and will be very costly to 
implement.  Fernanda believes that encryption offers sufficient security and 
she will urge the Commission to make an initial recommendation that does not 
include electronic filing.  This will be discussed with industry through a 
series of informal outreach sessions over the next few months; Fernanda 
expects some pushback on electronic signatures from some industry members, 
especially attorneys and law firms.

As for internet access and research capabilities, the FERC homepage will be 
revamped to include better design and more accessible information for 
non-FERC watchers (ie, the general public).  RIMS and CIPS will eventually be 
combined into one database that will be searchable (by words contained in a 
document's Abstract) and easy to use for researching and printing documents.  
All documents will be in PDF format.  The timeline for these changes is 
relatively short, with the full transition of the database and electronic 
filing requirements completed by 2003.

Susan Scott would like authorization to order an Aeron chair for each of her

problems, which she has.  Many people at Enron already have this type of 
chair, but we rarely, if ever, have a surplus because they are so popular.  
The cost is $567.77 per chair plus tax.  Please approve the purchase of two.  
Thanks!

The New Power Company: Going Green While Stock Price Drops
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

The New Power Company (TNPC, NYSE: NPW), which bills itself as the first
national residential and small business energy provider, announced that
it has signed a Letter of Intent with Community Energy, Inc. to provide
wind-generated energy to customers in the Philadelphia area. Under the
terms of the agreement, TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community
Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast 
Pennsylvania.
The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of 2001.

ANALYSIS: This is an interesting development, especially considering that
TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant
number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from
PECO Energy. This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers
who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain. On the other hand,
it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company,
founded earlier this year by Enron (along with partners AOL and IBM).

As you may recall, just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached
an agreement with PECO Energy to supply "competitive default service" for
approximately 300,000 of PECO's residential electricity customers who have
not selected a competitive energy service provider. Green Mountain formally
challenged this agreement, arguing that the PECO/TNPC agreement is "not
in the public interest" and that Green Mountain should have been awarded
the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question.
Thus, it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of
wind power to its portfolio of services. Up to this point, TNPC has been
working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers,
such as the approximately 285,000 natural gas and 20,000 electricity customers
it purchased from Columbia Energy Group. The acquisition of the customers
in PECO's territory was a major coup for TNPC, which is still in start-up
mode. Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from
PECO, the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further
objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity
as a provider of renewable energy.

Community Energy, the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power
that it will market, began making wind power available to businesses in
Pennsylvania last year. TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy
in fixed kilowatt-hours, allowing for more customized service and tailored
use of power. Interestingly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed
a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about
37,500 MW of green power to aggregated state agencies. This indicates that
desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania, and any energy
provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green
power in its portfolio. Thus, while renewable energy was not a fundamental
component of TNPC's original business plan, the company appears to be moving
in this direction (at least in states where it is strategic to do so).

However, this announcement comes on the heels of TNPC's announcement of
its third-quarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price. TNPC's
revenues for 3Q 2000 were $18.2 million, derived from the sale and delivery
of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states 
(Pennsylvania
and New Jersey). Gross profit was $1.3 million, or 7.2 percent of revenues.
Yet, the loss on earnings before income tax (EBIT) was $68.3 million. The
net loss for the quarter was $69.9 million, or $2.96 per basic share. TNPC
reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history.
Therefore, the company contends that its year-over-year comparisons are
not meaningful or indicative of future performance. The company's goal
for 4Q 2000 is to achieve revenues of approximately $60 to $63 million,
with an estimated year-end customer count of 340,000.

Eugene Lockhart, TNPC's CEO, said he was pleased with the 3Q performance.
Lockhart contends that TNPC "achieved both our overall financial performance
targets and business objectives," and referenced the fact that the company
is still building its "systems and architecture" so that it can continue
to penetrate additional competitive markets. In addition, TNPC has raised
approximately $546 million in funding which the company is using primarily
to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation.

However, despite its positive outlook, after TNPC made its earnings 
announcement
its shares took a nosedive, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy
provider's ability to meet its objectives. The shares closed last Friday
at $9, which is a dramatic drop from the average price of $25 before the
3Q earnings announcement. TNPC issued its IPO on Oct. 5, 2000, at a price
of $21 per share, which at the time seemed quite high for a start-up energy
company with a limited track record. A day after its opening, the stock
closed at $27 per share. The stock was received so favorably for two reasons,
in my estimation. First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments.
In two separate, private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital
Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214
million in start-up capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron
is the majority owner of TNPC, with 57-percent control. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and
small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC. Together
with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has come out of the gate
running with a significant beginning customer base of over 325,000 customers.

Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock, and
the company is at a crossroads. In order to keep its momentum on track,
TNPC needs to do two things. First, it needs to acquire additional customers
to expand its base. Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best 
opportunity
to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace
in those states. Second, as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov. 6, 2000,
energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative
fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors.
Consequently, it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that
it will be a provider of wind power. This could potentially send the stock
price on a upward climb again, despite the fact that financial success
of the company is still unproven.

Regarding the customer base expansion, Ohio looks like the next state that
TNPC will target. Just last week, the company filed an application with
the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state.
Yet, it's clear that TNPC is still fine-tuning its marketing approach.
In Ohio, it is offering customers competitive energy prices, flexible payment
and pricing choices, and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive,
but there is no mention in TNPC's application that it will provide renewable
energy in Ohio.

Moreover, several questions remain. Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role
for itself as a renewable energy provider, or it just providing wind power
in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state? Will the addition
of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC? Will TNPC 
demonstrate
revenues of $63 million in 4Q 2000? And where will the company's next 
acquisition
of customers take place? All of these questions directly impact the future
success of TNPC.

Subject: ECS Gallup contract: Update

I spoke with the person who administers the Members Only website at 
TriState.  I explained to her that we had been a customer under Rate No. 21 
since July but only obtained access recently.  She processes the request 
forms, and seemed to indicate that obtaining access is really a matter of 
routine.  She said we should have been able to get access as soon as we 
became a customer.  I told her we had signed a confidentiality agreement and 
she confirmed this was routine also.  I did not press her on the specifics of 
how ECS/TW obtained access, as I felt she had already given me enough 
information to tend to confirm our suspicions.  She was helpful, and had we 
known to contact her or someone in her department I feel certain we could 
have talked our way thru the red tape (if any really existed).

Subject: ECS Gallup contract

Here are some bullet points based on our conversation Friday morning 
regarding the ECS Compression Service Agreement.  These bullet points 
summarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a 
conversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined) 
regarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of 
the lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have 
additional comments, please let me know.  

We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that 
up to you, but do let me know if I can help. 

-  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a 
monitoring system that would automatically 
alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  

-  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission 
for TW to access the "Members Only" portion of CDEC's website (which contains 
load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a 
confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.

-  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on 
the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   "Good faith" 
by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any 
difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted 
in this regard.  

-  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load 
times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers 
with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this, 
but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have 
access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.

-  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July 
could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it 
did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information 
from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should 
therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.

-  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring 
system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the 
website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.

I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of 
the website; I'll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted 
"on a case-by-case basis."  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you 
know what I'm able to learn from them.

I agree with MKM--I think we either said or at least implied in the options 
conf. and filings that ROFR cap. isn't posted as available until the ROFR is 
waived.  I think that approach is the logical way to handle postings and that 
we are pretty much locked into that approach.  On the commercial issue Rita 
mentions below, it seems to me that Elizabeth Brown has the commercial 
impacts backwards--the marketers have always told us they are able to 
negotiate higher rates if LESS CAPACITY is posted as available because of the 
appearance of scarcity.  On that logic, we should want to keep ROFR capacity 
off the EBB until the right is waived.  DF

Subject: Re: TW Unsubscribed capacity & ROFR  

My thoughts on that we just filed to state that ROFR capacity isn't posted as 
available.  Yet, this , as I understand it leads the market to think it is, 
and then when a market requests the service, we'll tell them it isn't 
available.  Seems to head us to bad customer relations and false impression 
on capacity available.  If its under contract, we shouldn't falsely advertise 
it as available in my opinion.   What are others thoughts?  MK

According to Elizabeth Brown, TW Marketing does NOT want to change their 
Unsubscribed/General capacity posting to exclude ROFR.  They would prefer a 
footnote that capacity may be subject to ROFR.  As I understand it, TW 
Marketers feel that they  can negotiate better prices for capacity if it 
isn't widely known that the capacity is under ROFR.  Elizabeth suggested that 
they talk to Susan Scott.

I confirmed with Bob Johnson & Doug Aschwege that NNG's posting excludes 
capacity that is subject to ROFR.

I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a 
draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 
1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.  
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and 
will address issues raised in protests.
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail

Per Louie Soldano, I called Dave Sinclair (GPG ROW) about whether we have any 
ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the BNSF railroad.  
In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter.  Apparently, a bunch of 
utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to 
figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative.  If the RR owns 
its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be 
able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate.  In other words, 
the RR would be treated just like any other landowner.  If we did that, Dave 
thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war.  Since our lines cross or 
parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that 
would be foolish.  

I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was 
interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW 
without too much pain.  If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to 
suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this.  Assuming we 
can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the 
appropriate time,  we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW 
should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we 
decide to go forward.   

Other than the BNSF issue, I don't think we have any specific "to dos" or any 
specific comeback date to Dennis and Tino.  So what do you guys think should 
happen next?  DF

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout
and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy
monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While eternal
flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
like the way they do business."  A spokesperson for Enron said the two
cultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  According
to the company, "The deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  With
Hades' ability to attract and retain new customers, we see this as a
fabulous
growth opportunity for millennia to come."  According to several energy
industry insiders, Hades' high heating demand with very little need for
summer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.
Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide
and approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.  Enron is one of the
world's leading energy and communications companies.  The company owns
approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron
ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to Work For
if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A Week," and
is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by customers
with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts.

Subject: ETS risk management policy revisions

I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
Policy. 

Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.

Dan

The Commission accepted and suspended Northern's SLA filing to be effective 
December 1, subject to refund and other conditions, including Northern's 
providing additional documentation.  Specifically, the Commission denied the 
requests for rejection of Northern's filing and request for consolidation 
with Northern's Order No. 637 proceeding.  However, the Commission concluded 
that  Northern's filing lacked adequate documentation and is requesting 
Northern to provide the following documentation within 21 days of the Order:

1.  A narrative explanation and work papers containing detailed calculations 
supporting the derivation of all numerical values included in the attachments 
to its filing, including rates, allocations, load factor calculations and 
billing determinants.

2.  A narrative explanation and all calculations which Northern needs to 
recalculate the rate impact of the return and tax components associated with 
the SLA .

3.  Documentation including commodity prices and accounting entries for both 
the SLA and the cash imbalance mechanism showing how the SLA balance changed 
each month during the 2nd adjustment period (period ending March 31, 2000) as 
a result of activity related to the cash imbalance mechanism and how each 
monthly value of the cash imbalance mechanism was determined. 

The parties have 21 days to comment on Northern's additional data.  The 
Commission anticipates that with such additional documentation, the issues 
raised in this proceeding could be resolved on the merits without the need 
for additional administrative procedures.  The Commission further stated that 
Northern need not provide information related to the SLA balance for the 
period after March 31, 2000.  

I will forward a copy of the Order as soon as I receive it.  thanks, Maria

Subject: TW Compressor Monetization

Attached is my analysis based on a sales price of $14.2MM and $14.8MM with a 
buy back in the 7th year.  The loan structure for Hanover assumes that the 
difference between the sales price and TW's buy back price would be amortized 
over the contract term.  The remaining balance of the loan is assumed to be a 
balloon payment at the end of the finance term.

I will put together some analysis on a 9 year term and forward this on to you 
when it is completed.

Subject: Electric Developments  

I consulted with Kevin before I took the oars in trying to answer your 
question, as well as the questions raised in Drew's e-mail.  Here's what we 
found out...

Steve's question:

What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New 
Mexico (maybe 3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us 
expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California?

What you're really asking here is "What are the comparative economics of 
energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline?"  In this 
analysis, there are a few considerations -- (1) original capital cost to 
construct facilities, (2) the operating cost of the facilities, including 
energy loss, and (3) environmental and other permitting considerations. 

 Engineers tell us that, as a rule of thumb, high voltage transmission lines 
and tower facilities cost approximately $800,000 to $1MM/mile to construct 
turnkey.  This figure is comparable to the $1MM/mile "rule of thumb" we use 
for turnkey construction of mainline diameter (30-36") high-pressure steel 
pipeline.  

In terms of operating costs, for anything over 100 miles in length, there are 
three (3) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission: (1) 
transformation loss, (2) radiation loss (EFM) and (3) heat loss across the 
conductors.  A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3%.  This 
number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on 
Transwestern's pipeline.   

The most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission 
lines is in the area of permitting.  There just aren't many new transmission 
lines being approved.  It was suggested by more than one source that an 
electric transmission project on the order posited in your example, could 
take anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization.  The issues of 
electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation around high voltage power lines, along 
with other wildlife endangerment concerns, are significant obstacles in 
securing permits for right-of-way.

In short, the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be 
comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and 
electric transmission lines, the protracted permitting process for electric 
transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate 
returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure.


Drew's questions:

1. What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts 
his plant?

For purposes of this exercise, I'm assuming we're talking gas-fired 
generation.  Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding 
where to site a new electric power plant:
 1. Market area demand (distributive) and/or Transmission access to market
 2. Water rights for turbine cooling
 3. Ease of permitting (environmental, encroachment, fed/state/local 
regulations, affected agencies/jurisdiction)
 4. Proximity to natural gas pipeline/supply infrastructure  


2. Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over?

FERC Order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of 
conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and 
between other utilities and/or power pools in the various operating regions.  
FERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission 
access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate 
their transmission/reliability functions from their wholesale merchant 
functions. The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under 
FERC Order 436/500/636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines.  It's 
pretty obvious from the California example this past summer, that with 
respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual 
states, particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of 
Independent System Operators (ISO's), there is substantial room for 
improvement (and possible further FERC involvement).
 
"In the open access final rule (Order No. 888), the Commission issues a 
single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of 
service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission 
service.  All public utilities that own, control, or operate interstate 
transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro 
forma tariff.  They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own 
wholesale energy sales and purchases.  Order No. 888 also provides for the 
full recovery of stranded costs--that is, costs that were prudently incurred 
to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use 
open access to move to another supplier."  


3.  How do IPP's decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc. 
separately)?

In my experience, there is no "one size fits all" formula or strategy.  For 
example, in the past we've seen Calpine take a very hands-on approach to 
supplying its IPP projects.  In the mid to late '80's, during the build out 
of several QF's (cogens), Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground 
and dedicated them to the project.  In today's market, Calpine has scavenged 
the gas and basis traders from Statoil and set-up a natural gas desk for the 
purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western 
U.S. power projects.  In other projects, developer/owners and their lenders 
are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply/transportation 
to the project.  In short, projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply/ 
transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics 
and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFP's for gas 
supply/transportation, or whether to take a more hands-on approach ala 
Calpine.


4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care?

Last December, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, a final rule on Regional 
Transmission Organizations (RTO's).  Order 2000 builds on the foundation of 
Orders 888 and 889 (issued in 1996).  According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker, 
Order 2000 makes "a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations 
from the influence of electricity market participants."  Therefore, Order 
2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the 
functional unbundling adopted in Orders 888 and 889, continuing balkanization 
of the electric transmission grid based on corporate, not state or regional 
boundaries, as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of 
privately-owned transmission companies.  

FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation.  The order 
initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation.  The 
Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned "public 
utilities" that are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and requires these private 
utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate 
the needs of transmission owning state/municipal, cooperative and federally 
owned systems.  FERC believes that, regardless of format, RTO's will offer 
the following benefits: (1) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused 
by structural changes in the industry, (2) improve efficiencies in 
transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion 
management, (3) improve grid reliability, (4) remove remaining opportunities 
for discriminatory practices, (5) improve market performance, (6) increase 
coordination among state regulatory agencies, (7) cut transaction costs, (8) 
facilitate the success of state retail access programs, and (9) facilitate 
lighter-handed regulation. 

Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility, voluntary RTO 
formation and transmission rate reforms (i.e., incentives), Order 2000 defers 
for case-specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved 
in order to create an operational RTO.   Moreover, Order 2000 does not compel 
any transmission owner to join an RTO, but provides only regulatory guidance 
and incentives for willing participants, as well as a veiled threat of 
further consequences for the hold-outs. 

As to the final part of the question ("why should we care?"), presumably, the 
development of a fully-functioning RTO network will promote both the 
efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders.  As 
FERC reads it, the future of gas-fired generation for both merchant and 
utility systems, depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission 
system.  Therefore, the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and 
the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure.  Unfortunately, 
sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately 
cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals.  


5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?

Natural gas prices of $5/MMBtu can only "kill" gas-fired power plants in 
those instances where (1) there are more economical alternatives to natural 
gas fuel, (2) demand for electric power is offset through demand side 
management or (3) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly 
prohibited from use as a power plant fuel.  In the Western U.S. marketplace, 
particularly in California, I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel 
for electric power generation.  Renewable resources currently meet less than 
5% of the total electric resource requirements.  $32/barrel oil prices give 
fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas (even at a $5/MMBtu 
price).  Moreover, California environmental and permitting regulations make 
the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than 
natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible.   While demand 
side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting 
resource needs, historically, they have served only a minor role in 
offsetting the growth in electric power.  As to the final point, I'm unable 
to comment on the risk of future legal/regulatory restrictions governing the 
use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel.

When we originally decided to use my staff meetings for "graduate education" 
one of the hot topics was the electric industry.  We all had a first lesson 
on this topic in Shelley's electricity seminar last summer.  Now, John and 
Kevin have graciously agreed to join us Tuesday at 1:30 to discuss recent 
developments in electric markets and NN's and TW's efforts to attract power 
generation load to the system.  Specific topics I hope to cover include the 
following:
1.  What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer 
puts his plant?  
2.  Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over? 
3.  How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.  
separately)?
4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care? 
5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?
 Depending on how deeply we get into these topics, we may need to schedule a 
follow-up session at a later date.  I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.

Please Note:

We have changed the correlation of the Transwestern's hedges to the same 
index(El Paso Permian) that the derivatives were transacted.  We feel it is 
appropriate to make this correlation change due to management's anticipation 
to make the 2001 sales at an El Paso Permian index.  Due to this change TW 
has a perfect correlation, therefore the associated Value at Risk  will be 
zero.

I don't see any immediate problem.  As long as the advertising didn't 
interfere with the effectiveness and efficiency of Hot Tap as a tool for 
satisfying our posting and notice obligations, FERC shouldn't care.  The 
revenue would be nonjurisdictional and would be treated as such in Northern's 
or TW's next rate case.  As to the "type of advertising," I can't think of a 
legal or regulatory reason we need to be picky, but we may want to exclude 
certain types of services that seem to rely heavily on internet advertising 
if you know what I mean.  DF

but would obviously want to choose a vendor that would benefit from exposure 
to the Hot Tap audience. 

The revenue from such an idea varies.  If it passes the legal and regulatory 
test I will look into potential customers and firm up some figures.

Thanks,
Steve

Mike,

Finally talked to Steve Winston.  Oneok will meet with us in Omaha on the 
afternoon of Monday November 20th.  They will bring representatives from 
Business Development, Engineering, and Operations but no attorney's.  The 
meeting will be limited to CO2 mitigation.  They would like us to provide 
them with:  1) all facility or operational alternatives that we have or would 
considered including their cost, and what we would charge to provide them as 
a service,  and 2) any contractual or tariff actions we could take (like 
getting the CIG gas receipt moved to Dumas). 

Steve indicated that Prax Air (s.p.?) is challenging Oneok's "force majeure" 
contention and is holding Oneok accountable for nonperformance.  Steve will 
fax me a copy of the notice they received if Oneok's attorney's approve.  
Steve also indicated that since the CO2 level has come down this month, they 
will try to put the Helium plant back on today.

Subject: Re: Gallup Mods  

Apparently, someone has told Stan that they can make some changes to the 
horsepower and some of the piping and increase thruput by 30 to 50 MMcf/d.  
Steve Harris told Drew that the theory had not been proven as of yet.  Steve 
was surprised with the announcement.  I'm told that Stan believes that 
operationaly we can be ready by the end of the first quarter of 2001.  
Apparently Stan has talked with someone at FERC about expidited treatment (I 
do not have confirmation on this. It is all hear say.).  Terry Galasinni and 
I have a meeting tomorrow (12/21/00 in the PM) to discuss what is happening 
and how we are to get the information quicker.

Donna is continuing to work on the 10 MMcf/d expansion.  Once we know exactly 
what is happening we will modify our filing to match.

An update on the possibility of moving 20 MMcf/d off the San Juan Lateral and 
the cleaning of the lateral.  I have talked with planning and they have 
confirmed that if we only flow 850 MMcf/d on the lateral and by cleaning the 
line they can increase the suction to the Gallup compressor to 775 psig, the 
existing equipment will work to gain the incremental 10 MMcf/d from east of 
Thoreau to the California border.  We are going to meet with Bob McChane 
today to discuss.

Now that the celebrating has died down, lets decide whether to seek rehearing 
or clarification of the order.  If there is anything in it that disadvantages 
us, we should consider rehearing, particularly since it is a nearly certain 
that our friends at SoCal will file a nasty one. (It might be good for Steve 
H. or Bill or whoever has the best relationship with SoCal to make a high 
level courtesy call to extend the olive branch and tell them that we'll work 
with them to minimize their concerns blah blah blah.  At minimum, we'll 
probably learn if they do intend to seek rehearing)  

I see two things that may be worth seeking rehearing on:

1.  The requirement that we disclose our discount agreements in 15 days.  
FERC really punted this issue.  They say that "since the expansion capacity 
is fully subscribed we see no reason why Transwestern should not publicly 
disclose the agreements. . . . "  This is the first time I've heard of any 
rule that if your project is fully subscribed you therefore lose your right 
to confidential treatment of sensitive pricing info.  At minimum, we could 
argue that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because FERC didn't 
even mention its normal regulations and procedures governing filing of 
discount reports.  It just cited the certificate regulation that requires an 
applicant to "file" its rate information with the Commission (which we did) 
and ignores the regulation (Sec. 284.7(c)(6)) that doesn't require a pipeline 
to publicly disclose its discounts until 15 days  after the close of the 
billing period to which the discount pertained.  The commercial people need 
to decide if we care about this issue--i.e., how upset will the customers 
with the high rates be when they learn about the low rates?    Also, Frank 
and Steve and Susan--since the order imposes a 15 day deadline on this issue, 
do we need to file for a stay first and then rehearing? 

2.  The ECS issue.  
I think we can work around this for the Gallup project, by filing a report 
describing the operational control TW has under the O & M agreement.   I've 
talked to Mark Knippa of ECS and he is running the idea by Courtney and will 
get back to me today.  My real worry is what the "operational control" 
requirement does to our future outsourcing/ monetization projects.  I think 
ECS and Hanover need to have operational control over the assets in our other 
deals (i.e., TW compressor monetization) in order for both of us to get the 
accounting treatment we need to monetize the forward revenue streams.  If we 
agree that TW will keep absolute operational control on this deal, FERC will 
use it as precedent when we come in with the TW compression deal.  Arthur 
Anderson will crap on the monetization part of that deal (which is, after 
all, the whole point of doing it) if TW retains too much control over the 
asset.  I'm not sure how to solve this yet, but lets all put some thought 
into it.  

3.  Any others???

I'll turf to MKM the question of whether we need to set up a meeting on this 
and when to chat.  DF

I got a call at 10:30 a.m. from George Briden indicating that his client's

Houston for tomorrow's meeting.  They will be in their Denver offices all 
next week and suggested that we might meet up with them there.  Drew has 
indicated his willingness to meet with them in Denver next week.     
Given this change in events, I'd suggest that we pack-up a small contingent 
to go to Denver and meet with them.  I'm thinking Terry or Ron, plus Steve 
Harris (if available) and myself.  I don't have any dates/times yet.  I'll

what days/times will work for you next week?  Thanks.

See attached note.  I'm thinking that for a preliminary discussion with this 
[potential] customer, we should high grade the meeting as well as limit the 
number of meeting participants to no more than 5-6 from our side.  Bear in 
mind that Drew has a relationship with George Briden already and he will be 
here in Houston for this meeting.  In addition to Drew, I'd like to see 
representatives from TW Commercial, marketing services, and facility 
planning/engineering involved.  If you feel I've missed a function here that 
should be included, please advise.  Let me know your availability and/or the 
availability of your designee.  

Audrey, will you secure a conference room for us on that date/time:  1:30 - 
3:30 p.m, Tues. July 11th.   Plan on about 8 people.  Can we get a 
coffee/soft drink/snack set-up also?  Thanks.

George,
Thanks.  Let's plan on about 1:30 p.m. CDT on July 11th here in Houston at 
Transwestern's office in the Enron Building at 1400 Smith Street.  Just check 
in at the security desk, ask for me and they'll direct you to the elevators 
leading to our (41st) floor.  I don't think we'll need the whole afternoon, 
particularly at this stage, but I'll plan on at least a couple of hours.  

I'll ask a couple of reps from our engineering/operations group to join us 
and be prepared to answer questions about TW, its operation, as well as the 
estimate and underlying engineering of the lateral pipeline.  I'll forward 
this to Drew so that he can make his arrangements to join us also.

I look forward to meeting you and your client in person.  Call me if you have

This sounds great--I take it that they are still seeking interconnects with

Subject: Big Sandy Project

Kirk,
Great to hear that the project is moving forward.  I think TW feels it's 
emotionally vested at this point!  I will ask the Facility Planning folks to 
get started on providing a more detailed "budget quality" estimate of the 
cost to construct the interconnect and metering station.  With recent changes 
in FERC regulations concerning pregranted authority to construct delivery 
points, TW can immediately proceed to build without the complication of a 
FERC prior notice filing as was required in the past.  

Therefore, the only limiting factor at this point is the time it takes to put 
together the estimate, as well as the documentation we'll need in order to 
implement a new delivery point on the system.  To this end, I see the 
following documents:

 1.  Letter Agreement authorizing TW to open a work order to proceed with the 
budget quality estimate.  This will involve a commitment by Big Sandy to 
reimburse TW for the cost of the engineering if Big Sandy ultimately pulls 
out of the project.
 2.  A Facilities Construction and Operating Agreement providing for the 
reimbursement by Big Sandy for TW's construction of the tap and/or metering 
station.  This agreement would also provide for TW's operation of the 
metering station if Big Sandy elects to it to TW specification in order to 
avoid the CIAC.
 3.  An Operator Balancing Agreement (OBA), a standard tariff form agreement 
defining the role of Big Sandy as delivery point operator as well as the 
disposition of any volumetric imbalances that may accrue during the month.

>From a timeline standpoint, we can be in the position to get these documents 
completed within a relatively short time (30 - 60 days?) depending on whether 
there are any sticking points in our negotiations.  By the way, the only 
agreement that may take some time to work through is no. 2 on the list, 
although with our recent experience in hooking up other plants on the system 
this past year, we've already done a lot of the "lawyering" spade work.

Not that I'm especially found of meetings, but it's been a while since we've 
met to discuss the physical requirements of the facilities.  Moreover, we've 
got some new people in our Facility Planning and Engineering and Construction 
groups who would benefit from meeting their counter parties on the project 
side.  May I suggest a face-to-face meeting where I can bring our planners 
and engineers to meet with their counter parties to kick off this project?  
We can meet anywhere its convenient for you guys.  

I look forward to working with you on this project.

Jeff-
Well it has been a few weeks since we last discussed the Big Sandy
Project, and I want to move forward based on our last
conversation/e-mail.

Specifically, I would like to formalize a more detailed interconnect
(MSA/tap) study and associated cost estimate for Big Sandy.  I also want
to obtain from you a timeline, including all the necessary
documents/agreements, based on a projected Big Sandy online date of
8/1/03.

At this point, I am recommending that the Project look to TW for most if
not all of its' natural gas requirements, and thus, the pressure
integration issue is not relevant.
We are simply looking for a TW tap with mainline pressure, and a TW
constructed MSA.
I understand the CIAC issue, and as such, the Project may elect to
construct the MSA per TW specs, to mitigate the tax implications.

Please let me know what additional information require to support this
activity.
Thank you in advance for your efforts in bringing this project to
commercialization.

Kirk

He's not a nazi, he's a commie.  Actually he's a democrat but such subtle 
distinctions escape me.  What MKM is talking about is a conversation I had in 
DC with a buddy of mine who is a commissioner on the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission.  He said there is a move afoot to expand regulation of 
financial products like weather hedges, spark spread swaps and similar 
industry specific instruments that his agency has not regulated in the past.  
(they just regulate the commodity exchanges like the NYMEX, Chicago Board of 
Trade, etc.)  He also made it sound like Enron Online had made his staff 
people more nervous about the lack of regulation over those kinds of 
products.  The current strategy, he explained, was to solve the problem of 
the CFTC's arguable lack of jurisdiction over such products by getting the 
agencies with jurisdiction over the industry to which such products were 
being sold (i.e., the FERC as to energy products) to regulate the stuff based 
on the CFTC's guidance.  I assume that Kean's group is on top of this, but I 
haven't had the chance to check yet.  I talked to a guy in the DC office 
about 6 months about CFTC issues and will follow up with him on Monday and be 
sure they are aware of this leftist plot.  I can't remember his name just 
now, but he works for Cynthia Sandherr, I think.  I'll let you know what is 
going on after I talk to those folks.  DF

Dan also made a comment when we were chatting that the trading floor and EOL 
tour was "discouraging in a way" because they were not yet prepared to 
regulate such activities. I thought it was kind of frightening that he feels 
they need to regulate such a free market, although it was not clear exactly 
what he meant and I was not able to pursue it with him.

Subject: Re: Pueblo  

Here are some peaker data points:

Two LM6000's in simple cycle configuration can be installed for between $43 m 
and $50 m, providing a total of 80 MW.  Looking at a 10 year deal, there is 
no way to recoup this value and ENA would not be willing to take the back 10 
years on its books without an offtaker.  If EES or DOE were willing to step 
up for 20 years, there might be an opportunity.   Assuming a 9700 heat rate, 
$3 per MWh O&M, and NYMEX plus $0.39 for gas, the spread option for a peaker 
at 4 Corners would be worth between $33 m and $47 m.  The first number 
represents the intrinsic value, and the second is inclusive of an option 
premium.  ENA's desk (EPMI) would pay somewhere in between.  Having just 
inquired with the desk regarding their appetite for taking positions (short 
65 MW, long 80 MW) in Albuquerque, they were luke warm.  Considering 
transmission constraints into Albuquerque, their bid offer spread might run 
the range of the extrinsic value on the 65 MW load.  

Depending on site conditions (available infrastructure), a barebones LM6000 
plant could make economic sense.  The plant host would likely need to pay 
some sort of premium for generation reliability.  EES could sell fixed priced 
energy with a reliability premium to the DOE.  ENA would back-to-back the EES 
contract, managing market price risk and economically optimizing the 
peaker.   

As a stand-alone market play, a peaker is marginal at best.  By receiving 
value for reliability, the project might have merit.  Based on the thin 
margins, I am skeptical that we would want to build a plant larger than the 
host's load... that is more MW than that amount on which we could expect to 
receive some sort of demand charge.  Ultimately, the demand charge needs to 
make up the shortfall between EPMI's swap value and the cost of the plant.

Subject: Re: Pueblo  

Thanks for the extremely helpful analysis Steve and John.  I'm getting a 
pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently 
configured.  Just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of 
observations for the group to react to, along the lines of Steve's "However" 
section of his memo:

1.  Running this thing as a baseload unit won't work.  The fuel cost is a 
killer.  However, I keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 Corners spot price 
someone mentioned on the phone.   Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to 
support a peaking merchant plant?  How often are those types of opportunities 
available, and could a power plant in Alb. capture that upside by 
transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system?  
  
2.  We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant.  
Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE/DOD 
electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor.  I think we have all 
assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell 
surplus power into the grid (either at 4 Corners or, after N.M. elec. 
restructuring, into the Alb. area).   I just found the numbers I was 
remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual 
1998 consumption was 334.5 million Kwh.  By my lawyer-math, that is about a 
60% load factor for DOE.  If the DOE load is only 60% L.F., and the plant 
only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that 
arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds 
some benchmark rate ($.05/Kwh?  $.10/Kwh?  higher?)  the plant might run at a 
30-40% load factor on an annual basis.  The question is can we reduce the 
capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit?

3.  Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand 
charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., DOE) but sold the rest of its output 
into the grid only when profit opportunities arose?      

4.  If the answer to 3. is no, would ENA backstop the debt financing by 
signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what 
the government needs?   At what price?  Based on its knowledge of volatility 
and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners, and future profit 
opportunities that will be available in Albuq. is that just a dumb bet, or 
would ENA get interested if someone else (i.e., DOE) split the risk and 
reward?  

John, how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a 
way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley?  If we pull the plug on the 
project, I'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our 
information on why the turbines we would use can't provide acceptable 
economics.  I don't expect that we'd want to disclose the swap value analysis 
in Steve's memo, however.  

Thanks again, and I'd appreciate anyone's reaction to the above questions.

Subject: Re: Pueblo  

John's proposed plant costs are consistent with what we have seen for our 
ongoing LM6000 development.   I have priced 130 MW at Four Corners  assuming 
Permian gas plus 50 cents for transport.  This also assumes $4.70 per MWh for 
O&M and an 8000 heat rate.

For an hourly 7x24 product, the intrinsic value of the gas-power swap is 
$52.5 million on a 20 year deal, well below the $108 million estimate of 
constructing the facility.  A ten year swap is worth only $42 million (NPV = 
-66 m ).  That implies a market mid-price of $34 per MWh levelized over the 
period.  

Using the ENA Power and Gas structuring model and curves, we can determine 
the following:
1.  New build gas turbines cannot compete against the New Mexico market on 
price.  
2.  LM6000 CCGT efficiency gain does not pay for HRSG and ST over a ten year 
period.

However:
1.  Transmission constraints could create market value in Albuquerque that 
does not exist at Four Corners.
2.  ENA's power prices typically undersell the market.
3.  Commodity pricing does not accurately value capacity or reliability in 
constrained markets.

If Enron wants to do a deal in Albuquerque, we should be selling capacity and 
reliability.  Given the number of power- critical industries in the area, we 
could look at siting several remote units at different locations in the 
city.  Numerous chip manufacturing facilities and the Kirtland base could 
support several LM6000's for power reliability that is specific to their 
installations.  

I might also suggest that peaking units would have advantages over CCGT 
units.  Existing generation already provides ample baseload supply, however, 
the production of peak and intermediate energy is not necessarily well suited 
to existing units.  LM6000's have exceptionally good ramp rates that provide 
real value to a utility customer.  Not only can the HRSG/ST hinder the 
flexibility of the units, it can add substantial capital and operating 
expense with little real market benefit.  

We should also explore the ability to schedule load.  If the DOE wants to 
peak for a test, would it be willing or able to schedule a test for the 
off-peak hours?  Under those circumstances, we might be able to cut them a 
break on power and provide reliability of supply.

Bill,

Yesterday, we decided to look at two options for Pueblo; a 60 MW case and a 
140 MW case.  In order to match these outputs as closely as possible with 
available equipment, I made the following selections:

Case 1
Equipment     3 X GE LM 2500 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 22 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   67 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  73.4 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  8170 Btu/kWh (HHV)

  
Case 2
Equipment     3 X GE LM 6000 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 44 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   130 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  143.7 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  7900 Btu/kWh (HHV)

There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized 
the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F 
for estimating power sales.  I have attached files that show the build-up of 
the estimated EPC price for the plants. 

The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file 
attached.  The projections are based on:

70% debt financing at 10% rate.
10-year project and debt life.
8500 hours per year at average output (97% capacity factor).
Gas at $4.40/MMBtu.

The results turn out pretty much as anticipated.  Even with the larger plant, 
we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.

 You all should have received by now a photocopy of the 1998 Compliance 
Report from the Enron Gas Pipeline Group Compliance Committee that may be 
used to report 1999 compliance report activities.  In my January 5, 2000 memo 
to you all, we requested that handwritten comments/updates be provided to my 
attention by February 15th.

 I have yet to receive any such comments/updates.  Please provide any

These look good to me. My only question relates to Susan Scott and the 
suggestion that she sometimes bends over too far to satisfy her clients and 
thus might lose here effectiveness as the lawyer. This point is not 
mentioned. If you plan to cover this in the sitdown that is fine. I think it 
is a point that deserves mentioning to her.

Here's the deal--I just talked to my guy out in Kennebec S.D. and got a
glowing report on the situation.  His opening day group is down to 6 guys
so he is only giving them access to half of his fields--we get first shot
at the rest.  He's got so many pheasants he's worried about us limiting out
to fast and getting mad.    I assured him that the way we all shoot that
wouldn't be a problem.
When:  Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29.
Where:  Kenebec S.D.  (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from
Omaha)
$$:       $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.   If we dwindle
to less than 8, its $100 per guy.  (he will cut us some slack on this if
some of you can only hunt 2 days.)
Fish:  Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included
Lodging :  Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.  Super 8 is a
lovely place:  motto is "Labs sleep free."  $100 per night, 4 guys per
room+ $25/head/night.

So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.   I'd like to get 10 locked
in solid by end of Sept.  More than that would make the hunting a little
clumsy.  Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due
around this time.  What a lame excuse!!  You were there for the first 4,
right?  Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?  If you guys have anyone
else that's interested other than the folks that have already been invited,
let me know as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have
around 10.  Talk to you.  DF

NATURAL GAS REPORT--RESIDENTIAL GAS COSTS RISING
Residential costs for gas will rise this winter as the wholesale cost of
natural gas has doubled since last year. Local distribution companies
will feel opposing pressures of reducing the impact on customers,
while recouping their costs.

* This is not a one-year phenomenon. Wholesale prices are expected
to remain high through 2003.

* Rising gas prices were previously overshadowed by high heating
oil costs, but the spotlight will soon turn to gas as residential prices
could rise by 50 percent or more.

I will need to have any exception requests for vacation carry over (beyond 40 
hours) no later than February 15.  Any request you submit should have 
appropriate justification (i.e., what were the extenuating circumstances that 
prevented the employee from being able to take his/her vacation during the 
year).  Since carry-over reports can no longer be run by Payroll, timekeepers 
should be able to access year-end  vacation balances.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.

I agree that we should saya minimum term of five years. The in-service date 
will depend on exactly what mods need to be done which will not be defined 
until Friday or Monday but we need canvass the market now since the timing is 
right. The in-service could hopefully be even earlier.

First,  I thought the inservice was to be earlier than 3rd quarter??  confused
Second, on term I'd suggest we say a minimum of five years, so if someone 
wants to bid for a longer term they can--
Third, in the 3rd paragraph change the reference to term, to as specifed 
above-
Fourth, in the last paragraph, add minimum term of five years again.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

Randy from operations side we wouldn't have a problem operating the system if 
it can be worked out through legal. If it's decided that we will do this 
there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost 
together if you would like.
Thanks

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Subject: Draft -- TW posting/bidding procedures

Maria and Drew:  Lee and I wanted you to preview our draft before we submit 
it to a wider audience.

Some comments:  I've not yet included the automatic open season similar to 
NNG's; I need more information on why NNG does it that way before I try to 
sell our marketers on the idea, and I've e-mailed MKM about it.  Also, we did 
not include a minimum time frame for response to bid solicitation because 
thought it unnecessarily limiting.  

Would like you to take just a few minutes to give us your initial comments 
and also your opinion on how best to circulate this (i.e. to MK's group 
first, then to marketing?).  

Many thanks.

Subject: Pueblo

I heard from Tino this afternoon and here's what's going on:
1.  Tino has been focused exclusively on right of way issues.  He's been 
flying around in helicopters, etc. and not worrying about much else. They've 
got environmental people already doing non-field work on possible routes, 
like checking for available turtle studies and cultural resource stuff.  
Dennis has been focused on the political angles (apparently) and has 
purportedly gained some additional intelligence about PNM's effort to get DOE 
to re-up their contract for a new two year term.  Tino says DOE told PNM to 
pound sand and will continue to take service under month-to-month rollover of 
the existing PNM-DOE contract until some alternative (i.e., Dennis) comes 
along.  
2.  Tino wants to get deeper into talking to us about possible deal 
structures very soon.  This topic includes at least three things:  (1) how to 
structure the ownership of the pipeline to maximize Enron and Dennis 
finincial upside; (2) how to structure ownership of the power plant and 
related facilities to maximize Enron and Dennis financial upside, while 
satisfying DOE on Indian ownership, and (3) how to streamline the regulatory 
approval process.  An example of the concerns Tino and Dennis are focused on 
is "if the pipeline has a regulated rate of return, but the power plant has 
to share profit with the Tribe ownership entity, where do we put the bulk of 
the return???"  Also of concern is how we cut Dennis in on a slice of 
upside--stock in Enron?  Profit sharing on the power plant or pipeline 
ownership entity?  Something else? 
3.  What do the economics look like?  This is obviously a threshold question 
that we ought to be moving toward an answer on for ourselves, even if we 
aren't in a position yet to share the information.  Specifically, given what 
we know about the likely cost of the pipeline, and the likely capital cost 
and heat rates of the turbines ENA has available, and what we know about 
forward gas curves, and what we know about how much power PNM supplies to DOE 
and at what rate (from the document Tino gave us in KC and PNM's tariff), do 
we think we can build this thing and beat PNM's current price to DOE?  Can we 
beat it by 10%?  Can we beat it by 10% and have enough $$$ to sweeten the 
deal for the Tribe (partly because that would make it more attractive to 
DOE)?    

I suggested to Tino that he ought to put together a list of the issues that 
they are working on and that they think we should be working on and what the 
critical path issues and decisions are.  If we do the same, then we'd be in a 
position to get another meeting together and have a productive agenda and 
find out if this project has real potential or not. 

Bottom line, I think if our analysis of question 3 is that we can hit decent 
RAROC numbers and still undercut PNM's existing DOE contract and cut the 
Tribe in on a decent share of the power plant upside, we ought to move 
forward aggressively.    DF

Just wanted to communicate that I contacted Drew earlier today to suggest that
we check the pricing and execute the Conversion Agreement for Gallup.   As you
guys know, the recent price valuation for deliveries associated with Gallup 
have been 
well below the earlier market quotes.  

 Given the short term market reaction to the colder weather, we may be able 
establish
prices similar to the earlier market quote.   Based on the response from Dave 
and Drew
I have requested the pricing and hope to have that information by mid-day 
tomorrow.

Attached below is a proposed timeline for activities and deadlines for 
completion of such activities associated with the upcoming TW auction on 
EnronOnline. The timeline is set in order to meet the July 1 deadline for 
implementation. We have tried to structure the activities and deadlines so 
that it can be adapted to other GPG auctions as well. I appreciate everyone's 
help in advance in meeting these dates which I certainly realize are tight 
but are necessary in order to meet the July target. The key activities which 
are critical for completion for the week of May 15 are as follows:

1.Webtext for TW Auction----Finalized by Monday May 15 (to be handed off to 
EOL for auction site design). 
2.Draft Customer Letter announcing auction out for internal comments by 
Wednesday May 17.

In addition, a GPG distribution list for review of certain activities (i.e., 
customer letter, internal employee announcement, press release) has been 
included. We will  update this timeline once a week. If you have questions, 
please call.

THANKS for everyone's help in moving us along so quickly so far!!! We will be 
able to meet the July goal!!!

Julia



Thank you,

Tammy

Subject: Introduction

One of Steve Kean's newly formed Working Groups is for "Rates & Tariffs".  I 
have been asked to lead this group.  For those of you who don't know me, I am 
in Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Affairs group, in a section called 
"Rates/Regulatory Services."  Our working group will have about a dozen or so 
people from various parts of Public Affairs.  You have been 
selected/volunteered to participate in this effort by your group leaders.  

The Working Group members are:
Ray Alvarez
Sergio Assad
Roy Boston
Mike Grimes
Kyran Hanks
Rita Hartfield
Nancy Hetrick
Tom Hoatson
Paul Kaufman
Valeria Lima
Bob Neustaedter

Having this group will give us a great opportunity to identify needs related 
to rate and tariff issues across many business lines and countries, share 
resources, problems and solutions, and generally improve the cohesiveness of 
Steve's organization   One of our first tasks will be to think through and 
concretely specify what we expect to accomplish as a group.   We do not have 
a specific product mandate per se - it will be up to us to figure it out and 
deliver it.   Some possibilities are - identifying rates and tariffs policy 
positions, developing policies where none now exist, but are needed, 
identifying rates and tariff resources available to the group, and acquiring 
resources needed by the group. 

As a preliminary matter, could you e-mail me your group name, position, 
location, phone, e-mail address, and "area of expertise".  We will assemble 
this information in a roster to be distributed to the group.

Early in January, we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an 
initial meeting.  Please be as flexible as possible.  In some cases, we are 
many time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired 
time. 

As a second preliminary matter, please give some thought to and e-mail me 
what you think a group like this should accomplish.  Remember, the roster 
above has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tariffs!   We 
will compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and 
distribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeting.   At that 
first meeting, we will talk through expectations of us and of each other, and 
the proposed goals.  
Please have your inputs to me by January 7.  I look forward to working with 
you.

Thanks Lou--looks good.  Given the amount of $$ we've spent the last 2 years 
on this I hope we can hold them to this deal.  DF

Come out with a whole bunch of cool new machines and your stock gets 
whacked.  What a weird deal that is.  Anyway, when do you think the new IMacs 
will be out in stores?  I still havent' got around to buying Sandra her IMac 
and now she thinks she wants the IMac notebook so its a good thing I didn't 
do this last month.  Do you concur that the new ones are worth the wait or 
should we pick up an old one on mega sale once stores start clearing the old 
ones out?  DF

Please find out what you can about which issues FERC is interested in on the 
Gallup rehearing requests.  I.e., did they issue the tolling order because of 
our rehearing arguments on the confidentiality issue or SoCal's on the rate 
discrimination issues?  Anything you learn would be helpful, but this info is 
not so important that risks should be taken to get it.  Thanks.  DF.

Drew - I visited with the Senate sponsor (it is now officially SB159) in New 
Mexico and he would probably like to have some comments from Enron at the 
hearing, whenever that is (nothing set yet).  I think that you or Mary Kay 
(since Mike will likely be gone) would be the appropriate officer to 
testify.  I will try and draft some comments since there may be little notice 
for the hearing.  If you disagree, please let me know.

On another matter I asked Rob to find out who Tri-States Gov't Affairs person 
was and it turns out he is an old friend of mine (Dave Mazour) from my water 
resources days.  I spoke to him today and he was pleased to hear of our 
efforts to help.  He also reiterated that his Board is adament they will not 
be regulated by the PRC and will walk from the deal.  I'm sure I will have 
more conversations with him.

I appreciated your taking time to call Carpenter.  All of this helps our 
cause.

Title: Midmonth Report: Early Warning
Author: N. American Gas Team

*********************************************************

After a warm October, the first cold weather this year
has provided an early warning of what winter could bring
for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the
great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating
markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge
in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British
thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound
in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply
and moved the price of gas back above that of residual
fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of
gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow
most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap
extends through the remainder of November, a heavy
early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for
unprecedented high prices through the winter.

Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750
billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record
low heading into the heating season, and even a normal
winter would reduce inventories to a near record or
record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness
places the gas price playing field in the broad
territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf
Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next,
difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance
could come from switching to distillate oil, but low
distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean
that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per
MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely
drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a
combination of some switching to resid in industrial
boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end
users may be required. None of these measures comes
easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed
by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold
weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price
volatility at levels above the price of resid and
extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather
forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects
Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see
Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time
high for December. But even this estimate could prove
low. If the current cold snap extends through early
December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00
per MMBtu range.

Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum
CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a
maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record
low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this
level was reached only through a fortunate combination
of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent
warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is
likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong
way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to
offset warmth early this month, increasing the
withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on
average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of
the past two years. By the end of this month, the US
inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to
350 Bcf.

CERA estimates that normal December weather would
require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf
per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per
day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would
apply consistent pressure in the market through December
and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to
reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996
all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as
inventories remain on this path the pressure does not
end even with the end of winter, as a significant
increase in injections next year would be required for
inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf)
by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to
help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the
magnitude required both to offset power generation
demand growth and to allow this increase in storage
injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced
out of the market.

Demand-Keeping Warm
After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong
rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and
forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter
(November through March) was the warmest of the decade,
and there will be a significant rebound in heating
demand in the residential and commercial sectors as
weather returns toward normal this heating season.

Under normal weather conditions,
* Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5
Bcf per day higher than last year's.

* Monthly average heating demand through the winter
would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day
in January.

* December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per
day relative to last December.

Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further
increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to
normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal
scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day
relative to normal weather.

Fuel Switching
With natural gas markets this tight, there is
significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the
market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic
to price in the short run, which leaves industrial
demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the
market. This winter we expect

* all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an
alternative to gas to do so

* a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of
demand for power generation relative to last winter

* industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500
MMcf per day off of gas

* gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil
prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas

For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of
4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf
per day increase in demand relative to November, with
increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel
switching.

Supply-The Rebound
The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage
inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to
rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48
capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the
soaring gas-related rig count.

* The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of
Mexico is related to the combination of

- the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt
discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup
of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf
per day later in 2001

- the response of the shallow water to the strong
late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity

* Other important capacity additions are occurring in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in
2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play
in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in
Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam
play.

* Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New
deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs
are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older
rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining
rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling
companies struggle to round out drilling crews.

Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West
Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies
prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and
triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and
Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is
exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has
contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per
MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in
the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through
February, with significant widening in differentials as
heating loads decline.

Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but
the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance
is delayed once again, this time until December 1.
Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA
estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf
per day. During November that total should climb to 750
MMcf per day, despite the later published start date.
With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound
in midwestern demand relative to November and December
last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant
premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast,
differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to
spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into
the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:
* Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has
brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub
prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East
will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating
demand in the region will keep differentials within
about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects a December average differential of $0.25 per
MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show
significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm
week in the Rockies could still push differentials
toward $0.50 per MMBtu.

* San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close
to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant
pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads
in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub
differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies
pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin
to average $0.20 per MMBtu.
* Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the
rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub
and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to
trade within a relatively narrow range during the
winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either
east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA
expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per
MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per
MMBtu for December.
* Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are
now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the
onset of the heating season has offset those increased
flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15
per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in
the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the
strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December
differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect
to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub
at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices
$0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of
this increased basis differential is caused by fuel
costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from
the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would
have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at
$5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite
additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast
from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no
additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this
gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000
MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the
capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's
weather be colder than normal, we could see severe
spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000.
These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in
January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and
the extent to which new electric loads are realized.

Canadian Markets-Winter Begins
The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in
western Canada but is only now being felt in the East.
Storage peaked in the West in early October at
approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf
below the five-year average. Even with modest
withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are
still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs.
Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing
levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well
above the five-year average. With the eastward movement
of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin.
This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with
the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada.

The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal
"freeze-up," which bodes well for a longer winter
drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to
reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next
year.

Further Delays for Alliance?
The "commercial" in-service date for Alliance has been
delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of
problems with clearing the line, delays in the
completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant,
the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline
has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up
since September. It is estimated that flows for November
will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the
full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern
Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see
Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per
day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border
and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep
TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year-
over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern
Canada.

High Prices: Strong Pull West
The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also
provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential
has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a
result of this increased pull. For December, the
differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for
a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule
(US$5.10 per MMBtu).

Great--Texans know the difference between a dog and a bird.  Still unclear 
whether they recognize the distinction between a hen and a hun!!!  (Read 
John's email more carefully!)  Of course, at Pheasant Haven you can shoot 
both (and probably the dogs too) so the difference doesn't matter.  Kevin, 
I've been thinking about your original reqeust and may need to exercise the 
Legal Dept. veto.  These customers of yours are the same ones that can't 
drive a jet ski without paramedics around, right?  And now you want them 
wandering around Nebraska heavily armed???  What the hell are you thinking?

Tell you what, just to make sure I can tell the difference between the lab 
and the Hen, I'll bring my own Lab!  Besides, when I hunted there last, we 
couldn't shoot hens.

PS-- I have my personal duck lease down here that we can also make 
available.  There are overnight quarters if we need them.  (Last year we took 
over 600 ducks off the properties).

I'm not aware of any legal or regulatory prohibition on our performing such a 
service for Citizens.  We can't actually buy the assets without a FERC 
certificate, but that's not what you are suggesting.   I can think of one 
example on NN in which Northwestern Pub. Service owns a some branch lines and 
we operate them.  Whether we do it as a separate legal entity or as TW is a 
strategy call that will depend on whether we want to keep the revenue stream 
out of the regulated pipeline entity.  Since TW doesn't have a rate case 
until 2006, there is probably no reason to put the contract in a separate 
entitiy until we get down the road a ways.

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

PG&E Fights Toxin in Gas Stream, Movie Fallout

     Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran 
Dame of
     combination energy utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., whose film 
career and notoriety
     seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold 
statuettes. 

     Look no further than your local first-run movie theaters and the 
real-life drama, "Erin
     Brockovich," taking the actual name of the latest heroine to put PG&E's 
familiar logo in
     the klieg lights. Unfortunately for PG&E, toxins like chromium or PCBs 
in association
     with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. 

     Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier 
this month, a new
     real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates 
getting into the
     southern part of its California gas transmission system. 

     The movie is the story of a legal assistant --- a twice-divorced mother 
of three young
     children --- who single-handedly challenges PG&E, exposing its alleged 
operating
     mistakes that led to the use of chromium in its pipelines and eventually 
in the local water
     supply of a small, remote, high-desert town called Hinkley, which is 
about 130 miles
     northeast of Los Angeles. Lawsuits emerged in the early 1990s based on 
the
     development of tumors and other health problems among many of the 
Hinkley residents.
     By PG&E's own admission decades earlier it legally discharged wastewater 
containing
     chromium into the ground at its compressor station near Hinkley. Some of 
the chromium
     eventually got into the groundwater, and PG&E acknowledges it "did not 
respond to (that)
     problem as openly, quickly or thoroughly as it should have." It provided 
drinking water to
     nearby residents and arranged for medical exams for residents wishing to 
have them.
     PG&E also worked with local and state officials to clean up the problem. 
In 1996,
     however, PG&E settled a class action suit (one of several) with 650 
Hinkley residents for
     a record $333 million. 

     "The movie is a dramatization and it is pretty entertaining, so I liked 
it," said Jon
     Tremayne, a PG&E utility spokesperson. 

     PG&E CEO Robert Glynn told his employees, "It's clear in retrospect that 
our company
     should have handled some things differently at that time. And I wish 
that it had." 

     Litigation against the big energy firm continues. Involving the same 
transmission pipeline
     and geographical areas, the current PCBs found in PG&E's interstate 
supplies are
     coming through Enron's Transwestern Pipeline unit at the 
California-Arizona border from
     New Mexico but are not at harmful levels at this point in time. Routine 
testing early in
     February turned up the suspected cancer-causing chemical, which was used 
as a
     lubricant in high-pressure pipelines and compressor stations until it 
was banned. 

     "What we are talking about here is very low levels (ranging from 2 to 22 
parts-per-million,
     or ppm), well below (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) levels 
(50 ppm),"
     according to Tremayne. 

     Since the installation of a series of filter separators on both sides of 
the
     California-Arizona border, PG&E has concentrated on testing and 
following up along its
     southern transmission system that extends some 350 miles to the town of 
Kettleman in
     the northwestern part of the central San Joaquin Valley. PCB traces have 
been found,
     and PG&E has been working with the local gas distributor in the area, 
Southwest Gas
     Corp., to test for signs of PCBs in the nearby Barstow and Victor Valley 
distribution
     systems. As of March 22, none of the definitive results were in and 
there won't be much
     before the end of this month, according to Tremayne. 

     Both state regulators and the federal EPA have been notified of the 
situation. The federal
     EPA confirmed that PCBs are authorized for use in concentrations below 
50 ppm. It is
     the EPA laboratory tests that showed PCBs were known to cause cancer in 
laboratory
     rats. 

     PG&E spokespeople were assuring the public last week that the utility 
will "take any
     additional actions necessary" as a result of data from the ongoing 
testing it is doing of its
     transmission system and interconnecting distribution pipeline systems. 
And the utility is
     planning to install additional filter separators at various locations 
along its pipeline. 

     PCB-containing lubricating oils once were used routinely by a number of 
U.S. pipeline
     companies in their gas pipeline compressors, which help push the fuel 
through the pipes.
     While they are no longer used, some of the oils have remained inside 
some pipelines since
     the 1960s and 70s. If present, they are carried in liquid droplets in 
the natural gas stream. 

     Between the newly released motion picture and PG&E's local wrestling 
match with the
     PCBs, another class action lawsuit against PG&E stemming from the 
original chromium
     issue heads toward trial, pushed by residents in Topock, AZ and former 
residents of
     Hinkley not involved in the first suit. A trial date has been set for 
Nov. 27, and CNN's
     "CourtTV" program is proposing to provide live coverage.

which we'll use as the true up mechanism.  I've designated the agreement to 
be sent out by fax and FedEx, with two signed originals to be included to 
speed execution by PG&E.  I think Rod is the logical candidate to sign it but

Subject: Re: P G & E Credit Assurance  

Rod, Paul and I spoke and have only two changes. The second one is a more 
significant change to the true up mechanism language in paragraph #4.  Julia 
is in agreement with the changes.

Paragraph 2: after "by wire transfer", add "according to the underlying 
agreements." 

Paragraph 4: We felt this sounded a little complicated and may appear to be a 
deposit.  We would recommend changing the paragraph to read:  "Transwestern's 
invoice applicable to February, 2001 business, which is to be delivered to 
PG&E on or before the 1st of March, 2001, will include a true up of PG&E's 
prepayment for February, 2001.  All subsequent invoices will similarly 
include a true up of PG&E's prepayment for that production month." 

If you have any questions, please give any of us a call.

Subject: P G & E Credit Assurance

 In order to comply with the request we have made to P G  & E of a 12:00  
P.M. CST deadline, Chris Chung of P G & E has advised that our proposal has 
to be submitted to him by Noon today in order to effect a  wire transfer by 
the Monday deadline. Drew is close in the completion of generating the 
Agreement, however, with the internal review and approval process, it is 
doubtful we can achieve the timetable needed by P G  & E. It would be my 
recommendation that we extend the deadline from Monday, January 29 at Noon to 
Tuesday, January 30 at Noon. This would permit our internal review with the 
expectation of sending P G & E our Agreement by Monday morning and allowing 
time for their review. I have spoken to Drew and he is comfortable with this 
approach. Additionally, in my conversation with Chung, I indicated that our 
approach and proposal would be for P G & E to wire transfer the necessary 
funds prior to our providing transportation for February and then payment 
would be expected to be made for the January transportation on the 
appropriate due date in February. (Approximately the tenth )

 Please advise your comments at your earliest conveniece.

 Thanks and Regards.

Subject: 1999 NNG & TW Audited Financial Statements

Heather Mueck (AA) advised me this morning that in spite of our recent letter 
order from the FAO by Jim Guest, AA still does not believe we have enough 
evidence (other than our own opinion) to justify regulatory asset treatment 
for the Y2K costs.  While this position is consistent with what they had told 
us before we made the filing, they had given us no clue last week when they 
were providing their comments on our browncover drafts that they still had a 
problem with the Y2K assets--even when they were relaying Roger Willard's 
comments.

The bottom line is that they will have a PAJE on Northern for the amount of 
the asset  (aproximately $3.6MM), but the amount on TW (less than $.5MM) is 
so small they will pass on it.  As I understand it, that won't preclude a 
clean opinion on NNG this year, but the PAJE will continue in future years' 
audits until the asset is approved for recovery in Northern's next general 
rate case.  Therefore, if we have additional Northern PAJE's in future years, 
the combined effect would be used to determine whether or not a clean opinion 
would be appropriate in those years.

I assume we will suffer the scarlet letter of the multi-year PAJE, rather 
than write off the reg asset in the 1999 Brown Cover and be required to flow 
the write-off through consolidated earnings (and internal scorekeeping) in 
the year 2000.

>From this side, Sharon Damron's reaction doesn't fit with what I've heard 
from other pipes.  For instance, Staff called one of the CMS pipes to 
schedule a tech. conference on Nov. 14, but the pipe couldn't do it that day 
and offered to schedule it for the 15th -- Staff answered that they would 
schedule something for January in that case.  This story is more in line with 
what I've heard about the timeline for Staff.  

Also, in other cases Staff has given scheduling deference to meetings with 
customers (settlement meetings in Dominion's case, which caused Staff to 
postpone their 2nd tech. conference by 7 weeks).

Another thought on this.  Sharon Damron seems like a flunkie--she clearly had 
no authority to discuss alternatives.  If we feel strongly about pushing the 
tech conf. to January, I'll bet we could talk to Damron's superiors and get 
them to do that, particularly since they put this off so long before changing 
course on the timing.  DF

Sharon Damron called me today and asked us to pick a day between Dec. 11 and 
15th for a NN 637 tech conf.  I reminded her that a few weeks ago she had 
told me Staff didn't expect to schedule a tech conf until after the 
holidays.  She said that has changed and Staff now wants the tech conf. in 
Dec.  but she couldn't or wouldn't tell me why the change occurred.  I also 
told her that we are organizing a settlement conf. for the end of Nov. and 
asked if it made sense for us to see how that effort went before deciding 
when to schedule the tech conf.  She said they needed the tech conf. that 
week in Dec. no matter what.  Lets talk.  DF

First question:  "yes."  Maria, please draft something up for Mike.  Second 
question: "your call."  Maria or I could be available if you think it would 
be productive.  If they are going to get into any deal structure issues, or 
any questions on the documents, its probably a good idea.  DF

Drew - Do I need some kind of confidentiality agreement? An attorney present 
to discuss at first meeting?

MKM - One questions Jim Gill had was how do we get around FERC requirements - 
someone from Regulatory available to discuss at first meeting or.....?

Although we believe the operating agreement and other details are in order, I 
hadn't just planned to send them as is to Hanover. Some counseling may be in 
order here, as I'm moving into new territory for me......

Subject: Hanover!

Mike,

Talked to Jim Gill at 4:30 pm.  They are very interested.  He proposed the 
following steps:

1)  Send him an equipment list.  I think the Description and Location 
Schedule 1.1 from the P&S Agreement would more than suffice.

2)  He would like to visit the stations with the Hanover V.P. of Operations 
and one other person.  (He indicated 3 total.)  A quasi due diligence look at 
the condition of the facilities.  He would like access to records etc. during 
his visit.

3)  We could set down and talk "financials" after that.

He did not seemed surprised that I did not have good station plot plans to 
supplement the equipment list.  I will get a package together tomorrow.  
[Forgot to get his address. dah!]

I conjectured that you would want to discuss this with him further tomorrow.  
He said he would be in all day.

Charlie

I just got back after spending the day at jury duty.  I was one of 60 that 
had to go through voir dire.  They picked up to juror 43 but I do not think 
they would have gotten to me.  I am sure that I was struck by the defense 
counsel.  This was a criminal case and it appears that their would be some 
type of mental capacity test.  The defense attorney asked the 60 of us if the 
government should provide mental health services for those who could not pay 
for them.  This immediately rankled my Republican blood and I raised my 
hand.  I was the only one who did that.  Call me heartless but I am now in my 
office instead of hearing how the devil made him do it.

No word on the Supremes.  I think the longer they take the worse it looks for 
Gore.  If they knew that they were going to find for Gore they would have at 
least lifted the stay with some parameters on how to recount.  The longer it 
takes the less like The Goreinch will not be able to steal our Christmas.

We are freezing our butts off down here.  It is in the 30s and we may have 
some sleet or freezing rain tonight.  That is enough to shut down this city 
for a week.  Nothing what you are used to up there.  We enjoyed having you 
over the other night.  Mary and I were glad that you put us on the list for 
your traveling circus.  Tell Sandra to come on down.  It is really not that 
bad.  And the stock price is back in the high 70s.  We have money again!

Yesterday, Fred Ni from the FERC called with some questions regarding the TW 
options filing.  Most all of his questions centered around the determination 
of the highest value.  
 Bottom of page 7, last paragragh, we say Shipper call options will be 
awarded upon the highest rate payable for the  option component.
 Then in the bullets that follow we say, based on the criteria known in 
advance-  I told him that we would post the   elements and it would determine 
the highest value.
 Then in the next paragraph we say again sold in a bidding process to only 
those parties that place the highest value  on the option.
 Then on the actual tariff sheet, 98 we refer to in  33 c) method of awarding 
options, ?? being is the highest value
 Then on tariff sheet 157, in the Option Fee section he felt we should refer 
to the elements that make up the highest   value; volume , rate and term
As you can tell, this all centers around the elements of determining the 
highest bid,  I advised him that it included rate, volume and term that the 
option call was for.   We need to clarify these in writing as soon as 
possible.  I told him we would do so in our answer to interventions.  He said 
the sooner the better.  We also need to add expriation date on tariff sheet 
98 c as to items included in the posting, since it could be different than 
the exercise date.  

I'd say all in all this is good that this is his only concern and that he 
called before any protests etc.  He said he like the filing-  but was just 
confused on what we meant by awarding to the highest value.  

Susan, I assume you will be drafting the answer, although at this point I 
haven't seen any protests, let's try to have the answer filed Friday or 
Monday at the latest.    Please call if questions-  MK

On Thursday last week the Commission eliminated the old "Texas Eastern" rule 
that required pipelines to obtain prior FERC approval before contracting for 
transportation and storage capacity on upstream or downstream pipelines.  The 
new rule allows pipelines to acquire and use such capacity without going to 
FERC first.  The rule does reiterate that bundled sales of gas are still 
prohibited, and further provides that the acquiring pipeline will be 
financially at risk for the costs of the acquired capacity.  Interestingly, 
the acquiring pipeline apparently has the option of selling the acquired 
capacity under its own rate schedules or of releasing the capacity pursuant 
to its capacity release program.  The order is silent on whether the price 
cap applies to short term releases of acquired capacity.   While we are still 
reviewing the order and may provide additional guidance at  a later time, I'd 
emphasize for now that our normal contract approval procedures and authority 
thresholds should be deemed to apply to capacity contracts.   For example, 
the "Approval Authorization for Cash Expenditures" dated Feb. 3, 2000 
provides Dave and Steve with authority up to $250,000 on operating expense 
obligations.  

Please contact me if you have any questions on this matter.  DF

meeting live over the Internet.  We can contact Jan Butler at 3-7629 (she is 
sick today) or David Reininger or Julia Morelli at (703) 993-3100 or visit 
Capitol Connection's website at www.capitolconnection.gmu.edu if we are 
interested in viewing the demo.  The cost for the video/audio version would 
be $65 for the 1st computer connection and $15 for each additional connection 
with a maximum charge per site of $200.  Are we interested in seeing the demo?

The way I understand the suggestion, we will always be able to change a slate 
if we need to.  This puts more of the responsibility on us to keep the names 
updated if any changes need to be made.  I guess I have no problem with that 
as long as we can develop a systematic way of handling this and then be 
disciplined about following that system.  Bill--I suspect you will end up 
being our "system" so are you up to it?

Subject: Revisiting Annual Elections for Domestic Entities


With the goals of (i) getting the corporate database as up to date as 
possible; and (ii) increasing the efficiency of the Corporate Services 
department, I would like to suggest the following changes: 

Given the constant restructuring of Enron there are usually several major 
projects in the works to change the slates of directors and/or officers.  As 
we are handling approximately 2,500 active legal entities, it takes a great 
deal of time to sort out the details, handle the data entry,  prepare the 
election consents for your review and signature line initials, and circulate 
for signature..   However, if we take domestic annual elections out of the 
equation we can solve one problem area relatively easily.

As you are aware the domestic annual election project is a very large 
undertaking both for the Corporate Services group, and for the various legal 
groups.  Historically, it's been a time for the operating groups to review 
the slates of directors, officers, and attorneys-in-fact, make changes, 
review again, make more changes, until the final unanimous written consent 
resolutions are produced, initialled, and signed by the directors or 
stockholder(s) - a frustrating process that has frequently taken many months 
to complete.  I'd like to recommend to you that we reduce the annual 
elections to a more "administrative" function, i.e. the annual election of 
directors only (as required by state law).  I'm suggesting that we re-elect 
the existing  directors as of a specified date (within 13 months of the 
previous annual election to conform to state law), the consents are prepared, 
sent for your review and initials, signed by shareholder(s), and placed in 
the minute books, and the project is over!  All other changes to the director 
and officer slates, and attorney-in-fact appointments are submitted by you to 
us in the normal course of business throughout the year.   We'll send you 
annually the familiar slates of directors, officers, and attorneys-in-fact 
for your review, but the pressure on you and on us to respond to a specific 
election date is removed.  You  review the slates, discuss them within your 
operating groups, and choose your own date for resignations and elections, 
entirely separate from the annual election of directors function.

I look forward to discussing this with you and/or your staff, and I'm open to 
any comments and suggestions that you might have.  What worked well 
historically has become a nightmare for all concerned and it's time to open 
the box and re-examine the contents now, before we start all over again in 
June 2001!

If I don't hear from you I'll assume that you agree with this suggested new 
format and you won't hear from us on this subject until June 2001.

Best regards
Kate

MidAm advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline, probably today, 
to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the Carlton timing problem 
(i.e., the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement).  
If Midam does so, Enforcement will then contact Northern for a 
response--probably Dari or MKM or I, but who knows who they'll call.
If they do, the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary 
response to MidAm:

1.  Midam, and all of our customers, are aware that a Commission order on the 
June 2, 2000 Settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for 
this Nov-March period can be determined.  The flow obligation for sourcers 
like MidAm will be slightly higher--by about 3%--if the settlement is 
approved.  For all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation 
numbers would be under the two scenarios, settlement approval or settlement 
non-approval, we have given that information.  We gave that information to 
MidAm also.  We can't file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number 
for this heating season until the Commission addresses the settlement.

2.  The true financial impact of the current uncertainty on MidAm is 
minimal.  We believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based 
on the lower flow obligation number, but with an option to increase their 
purchase quantity if the Commission approves the settlement.  MidAm may have 
done that, but we don't know.  If not, and if the Commission approves the 
Settlement, their only real "cost" would arise if they have to buy the 
additional flow obligation volume--about 1100 MMBtu/d for MidAm--now at a 
higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they 
locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply.    Given the large drop 
in gas prices the last several days, there may not be any increased cost.   

3.  The bottom line is that we really need an order on the Settlement.  The 
majority of Northern's customers support it as a fair solution to the Carlton 
problem.  MidAm is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues.  
MidAm is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old Carlton 
mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving 
that windfall.    


That's the end of the proposed script.  The last bullet may go to far, but I 
like it.  Frank and Steve, MKM suggested that you guys get Doering and Gorak 
and others to call FERC (hotline or otherwise--I don't think it matters) and 
express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.  DF

No, we are paying them $3 mm in addition to handing them the Hobbs line and 
giving them the option on the Eldo-Spraberry line.  I haven't really thought 
about it, but I guess the transfer price for the Hobbs line should be some 
nominal amount--$10 or something.  I'll give you and Louie a call in a bit to 
discuss.  Thanks.  DF

Mr. Fossum,

Just today I discovered that Enron NNG recently advertised an attorney job
vacancy in Omaha.  My wife and I are native "Omahans" and wish to return to
the area.  Out of hope that you have not yet filled the position, I am
attaching a cover letter and a resume for your consideration.

Thank you for any consideration you might extend me.

Subject: Gallup - Status Update

The Rolls-Royce vibration engineer has reported that the compressor itself is 
not inducing the abnormal vibration levels on the drive end bearings.  The 
engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not 
harmful to the compressor for the short term.

It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to 
vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be 
reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any 
further feedback.

TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the 
vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which 
can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit 
piping. 

EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have 
decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction 
strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage.  
The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It 
is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system.

EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running 
without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running 
intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run 
time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should 
have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed 
with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor.

It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while 
the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the 
reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment 
or apply stress to the compressor nozzles.

James Pfeffer

$2.5MM SAP accrual which I will use to offset the increase in the Corp 
charges for this year instead of charging to the pipelines.

$5.0 -$6.0MM I hope to be able to carry over to next year.  It depends on the 
$ some costs really come in at.  We did some things in the second quarter to 
hold income back.  I can't  really reverse this year.  If our GPG target does 
go up to $401MM, I will have a $35 MM hole at my level.

I wrote off business development projects and some other things.

The inventory deal is still up in the air.  Rod will know more tomorrow.

At this point in time, even if it happens higher, we will still have a hole.

Maybe they can try the structured products???

Tracy,

Can you tell me what the ($10.2) for Enron Pipeline Company is in the 3CE 
(primarily in Q1 & Q2)?  That seems to be creating the remaining GPG hole for 
the year.

Our officers had been counting on having more reserves to carry into 2001 to 
help fill the NNG and TW gaps.  I also heard from Bob that the inventory deal 
may still be viable at a higher amount - more like $20MM.  Do you have any 
updates on that?

Thanks,  Elaine

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

Good point on the timetable.  If we can get to the letter of intent stage 
Caithness soon after this meeting Jeff is setting up--by mid July maybe--what 
would a realistic timetable be?  It looks from the map like the ROW would be 
all along existing hiway--not virgin territory.  If this thing is a "lateral" 
not mainline, and if we can keep project cost below the 2001 prior approval 
blanket cost limit (whatever that is--around $21 million I think) can we 
build under the blanket???  Lets talk before the meeting in Houston so we can 
have a complete reaction for the Caithness guys on cost, timetable, etc.  DF

Jeff, I realize you plan to bring the Certificates group in at a later date.  
But if they want gas service by the second quarter of 2001, we are most 
likely in trouble already.  Unless there has been ROW work and environmental 
surveys completed.  From the time we get approval to move ahead on the 
project, the certificate process will take approximately one year.

Please call, if you would like to discuss further.

Subject: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC. Project

The project's consultant, George Briden, of Snake Hill Energy, called me 
today to say that Caithness Corp. has decided to move forward with plans for 
the Big Sandy, LLC. Project.  To refresh your memory, the project is a 
proposed IPP to be located about 40 miles south of TW's pipeline along 
Highway 93, about 2 miles outside of Wickieup, Arizona.  I've attached a 
simple bitmap below (click on it and hit "view") indicating the location of 
the project relative to Transwestern's facilities.  Ultimately, the project 
would be built for approx. 1,000 MW of generation in two phases.  Phase 1 
will burn approx. 80,000 Dth/d, and phase 2 will burn an additional 120,000 
Dth/d.  Initial indications are for the project to be in service in early 
2002, with the lateral pipeline and gas service required as early as Q2, 2001.

Caithness Corp., based in New York, is a privately held company with diverse 
interests including geothermal (renewable) electric generation facilities 
(Coso Plant) in California.  George reported that Caithness would like for 
Transwestern to build, own and operate the plant with facility costs (current 
estimate, $20.3MM) to be amortized vis-a-vis a throughput/rate commitment.  
Caithness would also like the project to be interconnected to El Paso's 
system and the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline if that project should ever 
be completed.

Obviously, we'll have to wade throught the legal/regulatory issues 
surrounding this deal structure, as well as the requisite credit assurances.  
With respect to the former, I think if we view this pipeline 
ownership/operation structure more as a financing mechanism with associated 
operating agreements, then we're probably OK.  With respect to the later, 
George assured me that Caithness can/will set-up a funding mechanism that 
would give Transwestern sufficient assurance of payback.

George would like to bring down a couple of representatives from Caithness to 
meet with Transwestern sometime the week of July 10.  He suggested either 
Omaha or Houston for the meeting, inasmuch as he'd like Drew Fossum to be 
present.

Drew, I'm thinking it might be easier/better to have the meeting here in 
Houston given our immediate access to maps and engineering data regarding the 
lateral pipeline.  If you concur, what day(s) do you have open that week and 
is there an opportunity for you to hop Bill's plane for either one or both 
legs of the trip down here?  I'll ask Ron Matthews and maybe one or two 
others to join us so we can cover a fairly broad base of functions in one 
sitting.

Will you get back with me as soon as you can?  Others on the distribution, if 
you can sit tight we'll get you more information as this meeting date/time 
comes together.  Thanks.

Subject: Government Affairs Organizational Changes


FYI:  Attached is a memo from Rick Shapiro outlining organizational changes=
=20
in the Government Affairs group, most significantly the appointment of a ne=
w=20
head of the Washington office.

This is a great time to be at Enron. The challenges and opportunities at=20
Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day.  This presents enormous=
=20
challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us=20
individually.  As we discussed at the staff meeting last month, this requir=
es=20
us to constantly reevaluate our priorities, our methods of getting things=
=20
done, and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs=
=20
of the entire company.  While we have done an outstanding job as a group=20
within our current structure, changes are necessary at this time.

The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the=20
assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi=
n=20
the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair=
s=20
strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies.  The belo=
w=20
mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities:

1. Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets:  Jim Steffes
2. The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies:  Harry Kingerski
3. Enron Broadband Services:  Sue Nord
4. Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks:  Lisa Yoho
5. Enron South America:  Jose Bestard
6. Federal Government Affairs:  Linda Robertson

With the impending retirement on March 31, 2001 of Joe Hillings, I am pleas=
ed=20
to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November 6,=
=20
2000, as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for=20
leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office.  Lin=
da=20
was a Congressional staffer and partner/principal in two Washington law fir=
ms=20
prior to spending the last eight years with the U.S. Department of Treasury=
,=20
the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public=20
Liaison, for Secretaries Rubin & Summers.  Linda brings a terrific=20
background, both in energy and financial services, and is a welcome additio=
n=20
to our team.  In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs=
=20
groups and strategy in Washington, the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und=
er=20
Joe Hartsoe=01,s direction will also report to Linda.  Joe Hartsoe will als=
o=20
retain primary responsibility for NERC activities, although Charles Yeung a=
nd=20
Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe=
s=20
in his capacity of directing our activities for ENA.  Ray Alvarez will be=
=20
transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the 1s=
t=20
quarter of 2001 and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group, reporti=
ng=20
to Joe Hartsoe.

On a personal note, I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio=
ns=20
that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service=
. =20
Joe=01,s work ethic, intellect, and integrity have established Enron as a=
=20
company that is respected throughout Washington.  I will have more to say=
=20
about this as Joe=01,s retirement draws closer, but I look to him to be a v=
ital=20
part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur=
=20
over the next days and weeks.

I will be relying heavily on the above-identified six individuals to ensure=
=20
that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating=20
companies; that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business=
=20
strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future; and,=
=20
most importantly, to thoroughly understand how our organization can=20
contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis. =
=20
Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the=20
Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide=20
execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals.

In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government=20
Affairs organization; the following changes are being made.

In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the=
=20
EES group of companies, Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the=20
rates/regulatory group, now renamed Government Affairs Support Services.  =
=20
This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services=20
throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise=
=20
over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi=
ll=20
soon be entering.  Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati=
on=20
and report to Harry.
Jeff Brown, Tom Delaney, Mary Hain, Ron McNamara, Christi Nicolay, Thane=20
Twiggs, and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role=20
supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets. Alberto Levy=
=20
will be relocating from our Caracas, Venezuela office and will also report =
to=20
Jim.  A couple of special mentions:  Jeff Brown has done an outstanding job=
=20
in leading the CUBR (Coalition for Uniform Business Rules) process over the=
=20
last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO=20
efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning=
=20
wholesale electric markets in the U.S.  It is also my hope that Steve Walto=
n=20
will play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale=20
electric market issues.  The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess=
es=20
of the electric industry, coupled with his industry-wide credibility, will=
=20
provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts=
=20
across North America.
Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin=
g=20
the company=01,s efforts at PJM.  Tom will also continue to be an=20
organization-wide resource on technical issues regarding generation=20
interconnection and distributed generation.  Kathleen Sullivan has recently=

Sue Nord will head up the group that supports EBS.  Scott Bolton and Donald=

Lassere, while reporting to Sue, will continue to provide leadership on=20
telecommunications issues.  Scott and Donald have done outstanding work and=
=20
will continue to be integral to our efforts in this area.
Finally, the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process, beginning 1/1/01, wi=

be extended to all of Government Affairs in North America, including Federa=
l=20
Government Affairs and Mexico.  The RCR Committee, beginning immediately,=

Roberston, Jim Steffes, Lisa Yoho & myself.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thank you

Steve - is Leslie Launer(sp?) an Enron employee?   I know she once was, but I 
believe she lives in New Mexico and is used by Enron at times.  Do we use 
her?  What is her status and relationship with the pipeline group??

Do you get any reports from Tom Rutherford on New Mexico??

Subject: Gallup compliance filing

Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control 
agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At 
this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested 
by the Commission.

I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is 
checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW 
Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I 
do not expect the agreement to change significantly.

Thanks!  I'll keep the Nebraska plates for about a year just like you kept 
your Texas plates after you moved up north!

Subject: Organization Announcement



Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

Subject: New Power plants vs. rising gas costs

My thoughts are this:
 those plants under development (i.e. past the planning stages and into 
permitting or construction) will continue to move forward.  Their fuel costs 
are most likely already locked in or there is a pass thru mechanism to the 
power buyer.  

It is really only the near term gas prices that are high in this 
backward-dated market.  The 10 year gas price curve is still relatively 
inexpensive.  Those power plant projects in early planning stages or those 
with higher merchant risk will likely be delayed but that depends on where in 
No. Americal they are located.  Those plants slated for severely constrained 
NERC territories will probably continue to move forward, as evidenced by 
recent announcements for new plants in the MAIN and WSCC regions.

just my thoughts, you get what you pay for.

Drive to Succeed: Enron Prefers Toyota to GM

To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil 
and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead 
reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and 
pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. 

In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue 
its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference 
attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their 
skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its 
production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. 
The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the 
Houston audience. 

"In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry," he said, pointing 
to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford 
Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping 
all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things 
upside down. 

When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. 
It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to 
do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, 
packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy 
companies are now adopting that method. 

In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy 
industry. "We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them 
the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
over the industry." 

Enron, which has had a shareholder return of 1,333% in 10 years (January 1990 
to November 2000), saw the changes required by new technology and 
deregulation and redefined its core competencies, which grew from its 
pipeline business. Skilling said to remain successful, the Houston-based 
corporation plans to continue to morph. 

"It all hinges on one good idea Enron had in the 1980s, that vertically 
integrated structures had dominated our industry and the structures were 
starting to break up. In the energy industry, the reason was deregulation. 
Fundamentally, this is a better business structure for two reasons: you can 
be supplied with cheaper cost components and it allows you to change much 
more quickly." 

Instead of bigger energy companies, Skilling said he expects to see many 
smaller companies, "maybe thousands tied together electronically and 
vertically." The transformation and interaction costs are "collapsing across 
the economy." As an example of interaction costs, Skilling used bank tellers. 
In 1985, it cost a bank $1.50 a transaction. To bank on the Internet today, 
it costs a bank less than a penny. 

This drop in interaction costs is a major reason Enron finds the bandwidth 
market so attractive. In 1995, the length of time to provision bandwidth was 
six to eight months. Today, it's two to three months. And next year, Skilling 
predicts it will take one second. 

"We will have bandwidth on demand by next year," he said, and added that 
Enron plans to be the leader in the field. 

Similarly, long-term gas contracts in 1982 took two to three years to 
execute. In 1989, they took nine months. Three years ago, they took two weeks 
to execute. Today, using EnronOnline and other similar Internet trading 
systems, it takes less than one second. 

"All of the sudden the world has changed. We have the same manufacture cost, 
but interactive costs collapse. I think that because of this, we'll see the 
collapse and demise of integrated energy companies around the world," 
Skilling said. 

To survive, Skilling advised companies to "virtually reintegrate" what they 
need. "If you have an old vertically integrated mind set, it's tough. Give it 
up. I know there are still power producers who are buying gas reserves. I 
don't get it. It makes no sense whatsoever. You can get it online at the 
lowest cost. If your business strategy is dependent on this, it will be a 
very hard row to hoe." 

Each stage of production will become increasingly competitive in the next 10 
years, predicted the Enron president. "You're not just competing against 
three people in West Texas, but thousands around the world." 

Opportunities exist, he said, for those companies that "go with the flow and 
find ways to compete. Create low cost, dependable market interfaces...provide 
packaged turnkey solutions for customers through complex structures, 
differentiation and customization." 

The only threat is from the old way of doing business, he said. "But there is 
tremendous opportunity to do things for customer you've never been able to

offering real options to customers, moving quickly and being entrepreneurial. 

"At Enron, this has been the whole premise: to be able to change by 
responding and reacting to the environment. By getting components together 
and packaging them for the customer."

Subject: Proposal to Caithness Big Sandy

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.  Article 6 of the 
Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) 
with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an 
automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading 
conditions on CDEC's system.  We had a pretty good idea when we signed the 
contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start 
date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to 
"assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same 
result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and 
expenses" associated with the manual system.  We will fight with them about 
who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to 
"assist" us in managing the cost.  In the mean time, we need to make sure 
that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to 
mitigate future costs.  Do we have someone who is watching this out there?  
We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to 
manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.  James 
had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I 
guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to 
us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.  That sounds like a 
BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we 
can figure out a solution.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: Gallup Rebate

Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression 
Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management.  My understanding 
was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order 
for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak 
load periods.  We have not received access to this information which has 
resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of 
July through September.  Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder 
of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.  This cost is 
averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have 
in August and September.

I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 
that MKM's spies intercepted.  She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and 
discussed it with him.  Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the 
attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer's duplicity, but 
after tempers cooled, MKM and I decided not to send it to  Stan or urge him 
to send a written response.  As it stands, MKM and I will probably bring it 
up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated 
communication to the producers.  Stan may also bring the letter up orally 
next time he's on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to 
handle this situation.

Subject: REVISED NMNG Contract Approval Request

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL FORM

Various revisions have been requested for the five year New Mexico Natural 
Gas (NMNG) contract.  Please review the revised discount letter which 
includes the following revisions:

1) Clarification of Shipper's alternate rights at discount rate.

2) Deletion of paragraph granting NMNG the ability to change monthly MAXDTQ 
quantities subject to a floor level.  (Tariff already provides this ability 
subject to mutual agreement of Shipper and TW).

3) Addition of language which waives Shipper's ROFR rights.  

4)  Addition of language which would allow TW to apply a possible additional 
future surcharge if TW were to file for authorization to recover Y2K costs 
through a new surcharge.

In this particular discount letter I did not include language which allows TW 
the ability to retain capacity release revenues above the discount rate as 
this issue was not a part of the original negotiations. However, this 
language as well as the language overviewed above in 1), 3) and 4) will most 
likely be adopted as "standard" discount letter language in the future.

Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.
All officer approval will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential 
Level Approval

Jim--its been a long time since I bothered you!  Congrats (tentatively) on 
the settlement with the Navajos--sounds to me like you and Mr Soldano did 
some fine work! 

 We still haven't pulled the trigger on arbitration of the OneOk imbalance 
(the measurement issue) but we are getting closer.  Before we do, I wanted to 
get your thoughts on our "two prong" strategy once again.  You will recall 
that we intend to initiate the arbitration and simultaneously file a dec 
action in Texas state court.  That approach is described briefly in the 
attached pleading.  The pleading is pretty brief and terse--both Grant Harvey 
at Gibbs and Bruns and Britt wanted to keep the dec action as straightforward 
as possible.  I'll ask my secretary to block off an hour sometime this 
afternoon or early next week if your schedule permits.  I look forward to 
talking with you!  Thanks.  DF

I called Tino today to let him know that our affiliates are sniffing around a 
power plant opportunity and potential gas bypass pipeline in Albuquerque.   
Kevin, you should be getting a call from a guy in Portland whose name I can't 
seem to find right now.  He had gotten my name from Thome out there and 
called to let me know that ENA is interested in pitching either PNM or some 
outfit called "Delta" on development or expansion of a gas-fired power plant 
in the south part of Albuquerque.  It didn't sound to me like ENA was very 
far along in their deal.  I explained to this guy what we were involved in 
and swore him to confidentiality.  I also told him he need to call either 
Kevin or Steve before he talked to PNM.  I thought it was a little curious 
that ENA is interested in generation in Alb. all of a sudden.  

On the Tino front, he apologized for not calling after their big DOE 
meeting.  He said it went very well and that DOE is considering their 
offer--$.085/Kwh power less revenue sharing for all surplus power sold.  Tino 
and Dennis offered DOE 70% of the $$ from the surplus power sales until a 
certain target is hit (probably a target equivalent to DOE's current PNM rate 
less 10%) and then 30% of any additional $$.   Tino and Dennis really blew 
some smoke by showing the DOE guys this summer's Four Corners spot prices 
(generally in the $200-400/mwh range) and doing the math for them. On that 
basis, the net delivered power cost after rebate comes pretty close to zero.  
Even using a more reasonable sampling of Four Corners prices, the DOE price 
is apparently better than their current PNM price.  The big issue is whether 
DOE can figure out how to keep the rebate $$ at Sandia, rather than lose the 
$$ to treasury.   Sounds like the Dennis and Tino show is still flogging this 
deal pretty hard, so I reminded Tino that we are eager to do anything we can 
to help. 

Bill or Kevin, please forward this to Bill Gang--I couldn't get my computer 
to recognize his name.  

Please call if you have any questions.  DF

Please forward this to all ETS lawyers.  DF

All:  Please take a look at this article.  El Paso's inartful internal 
documents are creating the same kind of fun for them that Microsoft had 
during the recent antitrust unpleasantness.  I know that we can't control the 
way people think about issues such as market behavior, price strategy, etc.  
We can, however, remind ourselves and our clients to be very precise and 
careful in the way we talk about, and particularly, write about, such 
issues.  I'd like each of us and our clients to keep problems like El Paso's 
and Microsoft's in mind when we put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard.  
Thanks.  df

Business/Financial Desk; Section A
Deal for Use of Gas Pipeline Stirs Dispute on Competition
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN

03/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Early last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen 
companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from 
Texas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starved 
California. 
The winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company, 
which buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Paso 
Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid, 
in total, for bits and pieces.
Why pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint 
against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer 
is simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its 
sister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of 
natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity. 
According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of 
filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally 
that the deal would give them ''more control'' of gas markets, including the 
''ability to influence the physical market'' to benefit the company's 
financial positions. 
El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response 
to California's complaint, said the state ''grossly distorted'' company 
documents by quoting words and phrases out of context. 
The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the 
natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric 
power plants. 
At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive 
abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal 
regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry 
officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor 
unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize 
profits. 
More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country, 
moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to 
fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses. 
Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But 
experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New 
England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants. 
In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in 
the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy 
crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from 
price manipulation and profiteering. 
''They are the market maker with this pipeline,'' said Loretta Lynch, the 
president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled 
to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages. 
El Paso ''sets the price in California,'' Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was 
intentional. ''It has affected the price,'' she said, ''for everything 
related to heat and electrical power prices in the state.'' 
California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant 
''has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity'' on 
the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's 
owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to 
other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said 
that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit 
anticompetitive behavior. 
The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to 
make money by widening the ''basis spread'' -- the difference between what 
gas can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end 
of the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California. 
As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price 
of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that 
pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2 
billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 
months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup 
the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically 
is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in 
the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas-New Mexico price in 
December. 
To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations 
of market manipulation are ludicrous. 
High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are 
easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's 
utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or 
store enough gas for winter. 
''The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,'' 
said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North 
America. 
Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific 
Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in 
a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed 
company documents. 
''It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy 
Corporation,'' the utility said in the filing, ''that the business strategy 
El Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue 
involved manipulation of price spreads.'' 
The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal 
between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the 
agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry 
observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as 
the agency's public meeting on Wednesday. 
Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said 
recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of 
the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option 
that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic 
feet of gas a day. 
Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the 
chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that 
their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement. 
Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a ''gut-wrenching'' decision, Mr. 
Smith said, but was ''a first-class gesture'' to California. El Paso Merchant 
paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until 
May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that 
investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative. 
''No doubt about it,'' Mr. Clark said, ''we made good money.'' 
The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is 
expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The 
company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los 
Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent 
pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso 
denied the accusation. 
With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about 
anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created 
soaring profits for energy marketers and traders. 
Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints 
to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing 
capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California. 
In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline 
companies routinely favored affiliates. ''Abuses abound because of financial 
windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased 
complexity of the market,'' the company said. 
''There are some red flags right now,'' said William L. Massey, a member of 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was 
troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and 
power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural 
gas. El Paso is in all those businesses. 
''What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at 
work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand 
signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of 
affiliate abuse?'' he said. 
Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed. 
''There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse,'' said 
Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron 
Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of 
America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which 
California has brought its complaint about El Paso. 
To its critics, El Paso epitomizes the competitive concerns. It operates the 
nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest 
reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal 
Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market 
capitalization of $32 billion. 
At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts 
heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's 
much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is 
expected to earn about $1.4 billion. 
El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's 
profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it 
is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest 
quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to ''commodity 
market and trading margins'' that were enhanced by ''power price volatility, 
particularly in the Western United States.'' 
Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According 
to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was 
awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A. 
Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the 
bid. 
The presentation outlined what it termed ''strategic advantages,'' including 
''more control of total physical markets'' and the ''ability to influence the 
physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position,'' according 
to the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal 
to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to 
support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to 
limit its risk. 
For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation 
said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million. 
Under the heading ''Challenges,'' according to the sealed filings, the 
presentation stated that storage was needed ''to help manipulate physical 
spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost.'' 
On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at 
the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update 
for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: ''We will make 
money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread.'' 
The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by 
increasing the gas flow in the pipeline -- the load factor -- while 
increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and 
what it could be sold for at the other end -- the basis spread. 
In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the 
unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in 
months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices 
in the spot market. 
Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the 
pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in 
prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso 
Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last 
year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices. 
The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in 
the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal 
regulators, said California's complaint had ''misconstrued and incorrectly 
interpreted'' what it termed ''snippets of data.''

Attached is the URL for our new website for the Weekly Report.  The new 
format allows you to access the orders immediately and permits attachments 
from word documents as well.  Hopefully, this is an easier process for you.
We will be discontinuing the old format next Friday.

Click on Weekly Report below and it will bring you directly to the report.  
I'm using Explorer since it is more readable, but if you are defaulted to 
Netscape, you can still read the report.

Sack, lets see you try this with United flight #1292 from Memphis to Peoria.  
Hope all goes well in the airline bidness and hope to see you soon.  It won't 
be on one of your flights, however, as I've instructed my travel staff to 
avoid United just in case I get you and you decide to try out your old top 
gun moves on a DC10 or whatever the hell you fly!  DF

> Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement

> monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.
> Said Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While
> eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they
> require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier
> willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
> like the way they do business."

> A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
> together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits
> both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
> retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
> millennia to come."  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades'
> high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make
> it a
> very attractive energy portfolio addition.
>
> Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
> approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high
> growth rates over the last two thousand years. Enron is one of the world's
> leading energy and communications companies. The company owns
> approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron

I'm inclined to agree that its not worth responding to.  They also argued 
that imbalances should not be dollar valued before netting and trading are 
available, but that strikes me as an industry wid e policy issue and not a TW 
specific issue.  Any other thoughts?  DF

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they

Subject: Data Responses

I just had a good conversation with Sempra's regulatory person who is working 
on the data responses for Stephanie Katz.  Her name is Gillian Wright, and 
she is a "regulatory case manager" whatever that is.  She was pleased to hear 
about the extension til Wed 12:00 for her responses.  The best news is that 
she was a very chatty individual and was interested in our thoughts on the 
questions.  I told her that our answer no. 1 was just going to confirm that 
the recourse rate is in fact in our tariff where it is supposed to be and it 
is always "offered."  I suggested that her question no. 1 was a little 
different and to me, indicated that FERC just didn't understand the daily 
markets at all and further didn't understand very much about index to index 
deals and how they might be the best way to contract in many circumstances.  
She took that bait and said that their answer would focus on exactly 
that--that fixed rate deals create risk issues for trading companies that 
index deals lay off.  She also said that FERC's questions looked similar to 
questions Sempra Trading has had to answer on other deals and that she 
thought her answer would be similar.  I got a high comfort level that she 
viewed this whole thing as no big deal.  Are any of you aware of where Sempra 
may have been required to answer questions like these???  Kathy R:  have you 
seen any above-max index deals involving Sempra?  It may have been CPUC 
questions she was referring to, but I didn't want to make a big deal of it.

Gillian would like to get a fax of our responses to her at 213-244-8820 as 
soon as they are ready.  Susan and Maria please make sure we get that done.  
She said she'd send hers to us as soon as she could, but I didn't push for a 
draft to review as her thinking sounds consistent with ours.   

As for Sid, Scott Walker's regulatory guy won't be available until tomorrow 
morning.  Scott is having him call me then to discuss the answers.  Scott was 
appreciative of the extension, but frankly didn't sound like he planned to 
meet the Tuesday deadline anyway.  In fact, I'm not sure he cares all that 
much about meeting the new Wed. deadline.  DF

Thanks Bob.  I'd suggest that you handle the points in the first and second 
paragraphs of your email with Gary Peng, including updating the verbiage as 
you deem appropriate to address the North Dakota, weather, and mileage 
issues.  Please send to Mike Moran and myself the changes you propose 
(including the numbers).  We have already modified the language you reference 
in your third paragraph (per Michele Winckowski), so that's taken care of.  
Mike, you or I should let Rex know that a couple of these additional tweaks 
are coming through this other channel.  One of us can then send them directly 
to Rex if that would be helpful.    DF

Subject: Re: Enron Form 10-K  

We'll follow-up with Gary Peng (our contact in Corporate Reporting) on the 
numeric data and blanks.  However, for the verbiage for NNG we suggest adding 
North Dakota and deleting Wyoming from the list of states served outside our 
traditional market area.  Our research last year indicated that we no longer 
have any facilities in Wyoming and we do have facilities at Ft. Buford, N. 
Dakota.  This will conform to our Brown Cover footnote 1.  

The note in third paragraph about a warmer than normal winter in Northern's 
service territory in 1999 should probably be updated.  The decline in volumes 
from 1998 to 1999 was mainly due to cooler summer weather (less a/c) in the 
south end of the system.  We obtained this advice yesterday from Gilbert for 
another report requirement.  Also, the reference to approximately 17,000 mile 
pipeline is probably a bit high.  Our 1998 Form 2 reported just under 16,500 
miles.  This number ought to be consistent with whatever is used in the Item 
2 Properties section on page 29 for the aggregate of all Enron pipelines.  (I 
think Corporate obtains a table from the engineers for this disclosure).

The fourth paragraph needs to be deleted or replaced.  It appears to describe 
the Peak Day 2000 project which was old news in 1999.

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

A MEMO FROM DICK AMABILE


Thanks for enrolling in the upcoming P&D Facilitation training.  In order to 
make the best use of our limited time at the meeting I am attaching a copy of 
the "draft" material which will appear on the Intranet Site regarding P&D 
(Participation & Dissent).   The intent is for you to review the material 
before the session to gain some insight into what P&D is all about.  This 
will save us the time of having to review this material at the session and 
allow us to focus specifically on facilitation skills for the P&D process.  
We apologize for the somewhat disjointed format.  At the moment it is the 
only complete draft that is available, albeit in pieces.  I suggest you start 
with the last one listed below P&D Site maps.ppt and then progress through 
them in order 1,2,3,4,5.



P&D  was develop as a response to three of the 5 core ETC (Now known as the 
Pulse) questions identified by Enron for improvement. They are: 

  Most employees feel free to voice their opinions openly 
  My operating company does a good job acting on suggestions of employees
  Employees are encourage to challenge established 
procedures/policies/guidelines

Participation & Dissent know as "P&D" is an unique Enron created tool that is 
designed to provide our employees with a creative, free wheeling, 
non-bureaucratic vehicle for solving problems, addressing issues, enhancing 
decision making and developing new business ideas/opportunities.   One 
purpose of "P&D" is to create an atmosphere where employees can feel real 
ownership for decisions and express their views in a challenging and 
passionate way. "P&D" sessions are meant to focus on results and assist in 
producing measurable performance improvements.  "P&D" sessions are to assist 
our employees in driving change in an organized, efficient and effective 
manner.  It will help us leverage off our own best practices to produce 
faster results that positively impact our return on invested capital. At 
Enron we give our employees the power to dissent and with that power comes 
the obligation to participate in providing solutions/ideas. 

If you have any questions about this material, please feel free to contact 
Kirk McDaniel or myself.  We will be happy to answer your questions and 
provide additional context for the effort.

The only other thing we would like you to do prior to attending the session 
is to identify a potential P&D intervention within your own organization.  
This will provide you with a "real" effort to begin planning for at the 
session and make the application of the ideas directly actionable for you.

We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
            Dick Amabile

Colleen has some useful expertise because of her work on the Clifton Machine 
Shop project (i.e., setting up a new business entity within the ETS 
organization).  Tony and Lee have some time if Colleen's plate is full.  
Either one of them, relying on Colleen for "best practices" input as needed, 
might be a good team.  DF

structure such a "business".  I do not want this to get too far along without 
this type of input so that if and when it is presented for approval all 
financial i's and t's have been dotted and crossed.  Who would this be in

Subject: ETS risk management policy revisions

I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
Policy. 

Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.

Dan

Subject: Four Corners Pricing

Tino, attached is a spreadsheet with the info I think you need.  I got the 
publication wrong--its "Megawatt Daily" that posts daily prices.  Hope this 
is helpful.  DF 

Drew,

Attached is an excel file which contains pricing for the following delivery 
points January 1, 1999 through 
April 30, 2000:

 Four Corners
 Palo Verde
 Mead Nevada
 Southwest Power Pool

Let me know if you want any additional information.  We can get April 30, 
2000 to present information.  I just
have to call RDI--they put it out by quarter so at the end of July we will 
get the next disk.  They'll send me the
data if we need it.

Lorna

Subject: Meeting re Risk Management Policy

Drew, attached are my notes from our meeting today. The AA people provided a 
list of questions for us to review and asked us to get back with them on the 
questions. We agreed get back with them in two weeks. Also, Dan and Bob want 
to pow wow on the questions and the policy early next week. It appeared to 
Bob and me that to achieve AA's recommended objective of broadening and 
generalizing the policy along the lines of the Enron Corp policy, the best 
course of action would be to junk the existing one and start from scratch. I 
think you and I have previously agreed that the policy is too narrow. I have 
volunteered to create a new draft policy.

I am also attaching the existing draft policy with my comments.

   GOOD MORNING, 

I ask that you please attend one of these scheduled Safety Meetings.

The video is meant to be an emotional reminder to all of us on the importance 
of safety, and the critical nature of 100% of our employees supporting our 
safety program 100% of the time.  This would mean everyone in the Omaha 
office, as well as those in the field.

Safety is something that none of us can take for granted.  The 'Testament to 
Safety' video will certainly be a reminder of that fact. 

Again, I urge you to put it on your calendar.

Subject: "TESTAMENT TO SAFETY" PROGRAM


The "Testament to Safety" video was developed to make us all realize that we 
work in a potentially dangerous environment each and every day.  The video is 
very personal, emotional and poignant.  You will hear from three Enron 
employees who experienced life altering injuries.  The program will last 
about 45 minutes and will be presented in Room #149 at the following times:

   Thursday, December 7   Friday, December 8
      9 a.m.       9 a.m.
    10 a.m.     10 a.m.
      2 p.m.       2 p.m.
      3 p.m.       3 p.m.

Please attend the session that is the most convenient for you.  Other 
sessions will be scheduled and presented until every employee has had the 
opportunity to see this video.

A memorial poster has been placed next to your signed "Declaration of 
Inter-Dependence" in each floor's kitchen area.

UtiliCorp United reported a 75% jump in earnings per share for the third 
quarter led by strong results from its Aquila Energy subsidiary and an 
increased contribution from international businesses. "The energy merchant 
business continues to be strong," said CEO Richard C. Green. "Aquila's 
performance and the continued unleashing of value in our international 
businesses resulting from the initial contribution of our recent electric 
network acquisition in Canada and the successful initial public offering of 
our telecom business in Australia enabled us to exceed last year's third 
quarter results." 

Reliant Energy beat Wall Street estimates by several cents per share during 
the third quarter with a 37% increase in earnings to $389 million, or $1.36 
per share. Strong performance from the company's unregulated domestic 
wholesale generation operations and growth in its regulated electric customer 
base were the primary reasons for the earnings increase. "Our strong 
commercial management of generating assets and commercial gas and power 
positions in attractive regions of the U.S. has allowed us to break out of 
the traditional role of a local energy provider," said CEO Steve Letbetter. 
The wholesale energy unit reported a 642% increase in third-quarter operating 
income to $319 million compared to 3Q99. Gross margins increased by $372 
million. Reliant attributed the growth primarily to the expansion of 
commercial assets and trading in several regions, as well as higher energy 
sales and energy prices due to unique seasonal dynamics in the Western 
markets. Subsidiary HL&P's operating income jumped 13% to $500 mil
lion. Reliant's three gas distribution companies reported an operating loss 
of $15 million compared to an operating loss of $5 million for the same 
period of 1999.

Thanks.  I'll call Tino back and tell him not to fret about what he heard 
from Maddox --I know Tino and Dennis knew about the Cobisa project and I 
think he believed Maddox was working on yet another project.  I can get Tino 
comfortable without breaching our confid. agreement with Maddox by just 
telling Tino that we understand there is just one project down South of our 
target location, not two.  Also, I'll let Tino know that early April looks 
like the best time to get together to talk numbers and we'll call to set it 
up when we are ready.  DF

Subject: Re: Pueblo: CONFIDENTIAL  

Drew - Good timing.  Here's what I know:

1) Jack Maddox and I have spoken sporadically in the past about very nebulous 
projects in areas near TW.  (We even have a signed Confidentiality Agreement 
with him!)  After I read your memo, I called him to see what's going on.  

He is working on a 220 MW gas-fired plant near Belen, NM.  Houston-based 
Cobisa Corp. will ask the city of Belen to issue industrial revenue bonds to 
help it build this plant.  Power generated by the plant will be sold to 
customers through service agreements with electricity moving along existing 
PNM lines.  Plans call for construction to begin by Spring 2001 with 
operations to begin by 2003.  Kevin and I have a meeting scheduled with him 
next Friday, March 31 in Albuquereque.  We'll keep you posted.

2)  I received the economic analysis today which factors in some of Dennis 
Langley's wish list.  The "as good as it gets" rate, assuming the project is 
sized at 150,000 MMBtu and fully subscribed over the project life of 10 
years, is $.1631.  This does not include a) any ROW cost, b) a 50/50 split of 
any incremental revenue TW receives on its existing line as a result of 
additional capacity sold to serve new markets, or c) 25% of ownership in the 
assets and 25% of the cash flow stream after payout.  

 I need to continue working the economics with James Centilli.  In the 
meantime, our consultant, Mark Baldwin will hopefully provide us with 
critical market information near the end of March. This is also around the 
time when Tino should have his report on detailed the cost estimate of 
construction and environmental issues.  Maybe we should rally first part of 
April to see where we are.

Lorraine

Subject: Pueblo: CONFIDENTIAL

Here's the latest Tino-gram:
1.  Tino's environ. consultants have not discovered any stop signs.  

2.  The Isleta is interested in granting Dennis ROW/lease for the power plant 
as well as the pipeline.  The power plant could be located on Isleta land 
adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation.  Thus, the power 
plant could be connected to DOE's existing powerline infrastructure without 
ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land.  PNM would not be necessary to move 
power to DOE.  Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant 
optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power.  (maybe  this 
could be done through DOE to an interconnect with PNM on the Scandia 
reservation?)

3.  Dennis is using Jim Slattery, an ex law partner of mine in DC (and ex 
Dem. U.S. Congressman from Kansas), as his primary contact with  Bill 
Richardson at DOE.  My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship 
with Richardson, so this seems very likely to be effective.  Tino reports 
that "DOE is OK with the deal" and the next step is negotiating the power 
contract itself.  Tino said that DOE is aware that the capital for the 
project will not come from the tribe so the tribe's interest will be fairly 
thin.   It is unclear exactly how much indian ownership Dennis and Slattery 
promised DOE.

4.  Tino has run into a power plant consultant named Jack Maddox who says 
he's working on a 230MW plant to be located west of Belen.  Tino thinks he's 
working for the Laguna tribe, but wanted us to find out who is planning a big 
power plant out there.  Is this ours?  PNM's?  El Paso?  

Finally, the next key step is obviously the economics.  Based on what Tino 
told me, I'm convinced that Dennis and Tino don't have a real good sense of 
how much $$$ might be in this deal.  They are groping a bit and our initial 
analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight.  How are those

Danny, I'm resending as I had the same problem Cindy did.  I'll give you a 
call later today after I've talked to Harris to discuss the various Gallup 
scenarios to make sure you and I are on the same page.   The plan that makes 
the most sense in my mind is to ram the 10,000/d  project through asap, with 
no firm contracts to preserve our options on a NEWCO structure.  We'll 
simultaneously implement a new approach on San Juan fuel transport if 
possible and then throw the big expansion into the hopper at FERC in January 
as Stan suggested.  I hope that timetable is doable--it all depends on 
planning/ops deciding what they want to build and then clearing our financial 
hurdles.   DF

I agree with Danny's email that the key timetable issue for the incremental
10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the
15,000hp motor.  It was my understanding that the long lead time items were
going to be ordered shortly (if they haven't been already) and that we'd
take the financial risk.  If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals
won't be the critical path item they usually are.  I've reviewed the FERC
application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a
request for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would
expedite things.  Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would
allow us to avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San
Juan lateral.  If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan,
the additional horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional
flexibility or additional capacity.   I'll talk to Steve today to make sure
we are doing everything possible to expedite these efforts.  DF

I believe that Phil Lowry is looking at ways to get some additional
capacity out of the system as well.  We want to expedite these efforts
too..  I would like to see an application filed filed by January 31st to
get 30 to 50 MMCF/D.

Steve Harris and Phil Lowry should have the lead to get this done.  I am
willing to construct at risk but want to see the financials as well.

his DOE situation in detail and then take him up on the due diligence

I guess this is good news unless they introduce the "next steps" section at 
the meeting with a slide that is titled "Step One:  Shutting Your Sorry-Ass 
Pipeline Down ONce and For All" .   Seriously, the agenda doesn't seem to 
have any flavor of escalation, which is great given the  lack of attractive 
alternatives for our team right now.  Talk to you about this tomorrow.  DF

Rich,
Attached is a draft agenda for our July 13 meeting.
Most of us will be staying the night of 7/12 at the Holiday Inn in
Flagstaff.  Your directions look pretty clear but if you could send me via
e-mail or fax (415-973-6112) a map that would help keep us from getting
lost.

thanks,

Absolutely.  I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil and 
his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking etc.  
We'll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary on that 
project.  On the quick 10 million/day that we've been working on, there's a 
potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may get us the 
10 million much quicker and at a lower cost.  Steve Harris and I talked about 
it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or two.  We will be 
ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup if the alternative 
doesn't pan out.  We'll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d project with the 
Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes.  DF

Lets make sure we are picking-up on the other ideas Phil has for getting 
additional capacity on Tw.  If any of his ideas require regulatory approval 
we will probably want to include in the same certificate application.

Thanks for the update--Other than the Gallagher Boland $$$ I can't think of 
anything that we might be squirreling away and capitalizing.  (Grynberg $$ go 
to a work order also, but are expensed, right?).  Also, I absolutely trust 
you, but in the Ronald Reagan sense:  "Trust, but verify."  Adios.  DF

DREW - SINCE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON I SPOKE WITH ELAINE.   

WE HAVE CAPITAL CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC PROJECTS - SUCH AS AN 
EXPANSION PROJECT.  I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY OF THOSE AND I HAVE PROVIDED 
MS. PATEL A LIST OF ET&S PROJECTS THAT FIT IN THIS CATEGORY (I ONLY HAD A 
COUPLE AS WELL).

THERE COULD BE OTHER CHARGES WHICH ARE ALLOCATED TO A GENERAL OVERHEAD AND 
CAPITALIZED.  THE ONLY MATTER THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY WOULD BE THE 
GALLAGHER/BOLAND (OUTSIDE COUNSEL) COSTS.  WE HAVE THESE GOING TO A WORK 
ORDER FOR THE YEAR 2000 (A TOTAL AMOUNT OF ABOUT $425,000 FOR NORTHERN).  I 
BELIEVE WE WERE PLANNING TO ESTIMATE THE COSTS AS THE SAME FOR 2001 AND TREAT 
THEM THE SAME (ASSUMING ELAINE AND OTHERS GIVE US THE GO AHEAD).

ELAINE - ANYTHING TO ADD?  ALSO, I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE COLLECTING THESE 
CHARGES FROM ALL GROUPS AND WILL GET BACK TO US??  (AND YOU WILL PUT ME ON 
YOUR DISTRIBUTION LIST SINCE I DON'T TRUST DREW AND HE'S TOO SMART TO TRUST 
ME.) THX.

I guess you wouldn't want to use any of the joint venture entities to issue 
the guarantee because of the complexities of their ownership structures.  You 
also wouldn't want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate 
issues.  By process of elimination, I guess I'm OK with NN issuing the 
guarantee.  In my view, if Mavrix' commercial strategies are unsuccessful and 
Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those 
dollars in Northern's next rate case.  Thanks.  DF

Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp., which is a subsidiary of ETS, needs to 
satisfy TW's creditworthiness requirements in order to enter into a 
transportation agreement with TW.  Paul Cherry has suggested that Northern 
Natural Gas issue a guarantee.  Please let me know whether you think this 
would be acceptable.  If Mavrix wanted to hold NNG capacity, TW could issue 
the guarantee.

25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before

Subject: DUKE

Hey, the day's slippping away and I remember how yesterday went.  (Remember 
Kimball?)  I have a meeting with MKM and FX from 3-5 on the May 9 meeting in 
KC, so here are my thoughts on the call to Foglar:

 "Hey Murray, this is Drew.  We received the Chisos complaint and I thought 
I'd get ahold of you and see if there is any appetite at Duke to sit down and 
discuss resolving these issues in lieu of spending a lot of money on motions 
in Pecos County"   Grunt.  "I am curious whether the pleading is evidence 
that Duke/Chisos are not interested in resolving this outside the courts, or 
is it just a natural reaction to our letter;  a move to bring Northern to the 
table?"  Grunt.  "Is Chisos serious about litigating this?"  Grunt. "If 
Northern and Duke were to get together in the next 3 weeks, do you think it 
would make sense for Chisos to also attend?  Who do you think Duke would 
send?"  Grunt.  "Do you think Chisos would hold off on serving the petition 
pending discussions?"  

I can't think of much else to say/ask.   jrt

I saw in the press that N.M. has delayed electric open access until Jan 1, 02 
for residentials and small commercials and to July 1, 02 for large 
industrials.  That increases the likelihood that the Pueblo project will have 
to dump power in the wholesale market at 4 Corners for a while before retail 
markets start to open up.  One more thing to factor in.

I'm expecting to hook up with Bill Votaw of Enron Federal Solutions today to 
talk about Langley's "sole source" procurement strategy with DOE.  I hope to 
get Votaw on the phone with Langley's D.C. govt. contracts lawyers to discuss 
their theory.  We should be in a better position to raise a flag if the sole 
source strategy is really a high risk approach.  I'm not sure where that 
would leave us because the only other approach I can think of is to steer DOE 
into opening the power plant up for bids.  Langley does not appear interested 
in trying to win an open bid for the power plant, although frankly we would 
probably have about as good a chance as anyone of winning.

Once we clear up the government contracts issues (if ever) it seems to me 
that it would be time to expand the team to include Federal Solutions 
(potentially, if they see an angle to help them with their Kirtland 
outsourcing strategy) and ENA.  The ENA involvement would be particularly 
important so we could get a line of specific turbine availability and the 
specifications/economics that would result.  I'm probably engaging in wishful 
thinking again, but my hope is that the economics on a specific turbine/heat 
exchanger configuration work out a little better than the generic economics 
from the model that James ran.   If we think this thing is a potentially 
viable deal after I talk to Votaw and the Langley DC team, we need to grab 
Bill Cordes and discuss whether we go to ENA "from the bottom up," or through 
Stan "from the top down" to get hooked into a deal team over there.  Kevin, I 
still intend to hook you into the Votaw-DC call if you are available.  
Thanks. DF

PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources

Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both
companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will
acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free,
stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western
Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE
subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n
named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, 
Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including
its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into 
Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders.

Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated
equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including
conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new
holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western
Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of
approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total
enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9
billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for
as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's
earnings per share and cash flow.

Subject: Revised Contract Approval Request - Phillips Petroleum Company

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Phillips Petroleum Company's discount letter was recently approved by 
Transwestern's Officer group.   However, Phillips has now requested that 
Transwestern include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
applicable discount rate in the event that Transwestern's minimum Tariff rate 
were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
underlined when provided to Phillips).  The inclusion of this language would 
require Transwestern to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
flow under the term of the amendment.  Transwestern would file this discount 
on January 31, 2001.

Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be sent to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
approval.

Congratulations on the move!  Its great to see a reorg that actually seems to 
make so much sense!  Thanks again to you and Terry for watching the three 
stooges on Saturday night.  It was great seeing you guys again and getting

Effective immediately, Joe Jeffers, Manager of Technical Training and Skill 
Based Pay Administration, and his team of Dick Heitman, Cliff McPherson, 
Andrea Woody and Lupi Trevino will move from ETS Human Resources to ETS 
Operations Technical Services.  Joe will report to Steve Klimesh.  

This move will better align Technical Training and SBP Administration with 
Operations and enhance the interfaces that take place between this group and 
ETS Operations management and the field teams. 

Joe and his team have provided outstanding support to Operations in the past, 
and it is expected that this high standard of customer service will 
continue.  We will be sending more information in the very near future with 
regard to the individual support accountabilities of the team members.  

Please join me in welcoming this team and helping to make their transition a 
smooth one.

Would we be better off letting the trade associations fight this one out?  I 
haven't read the pleading yet, but from your description, I wouldn't be 
surprised if all of them oppose it--AGA included.  DF

Subject: Complaint Against Gas Sellers to Reimpose Price Caps - Docket No 
RP01-223

The National Association of Gas Consumers (an association of municipal gas 
systems) has filed a complaint against all sellers of natural gas in the US 
to re-impose wholesale prices caps.  They are seeking a benchmark (soft cap) 
of $2.74/MMBtu.

The benchmark figure is based on an average gas forecast from a recent 
National Petroleum Council study.  (Ken Lay is a member of the NPC).

The procedural rules are a bit fuzzy.  Ordinarily, respondents have 20 days 
to answer a complaint.   However, FERC rules provide for service on 
respondents.  Here NAGC has not named specific respondents.

This explains a lot.  Lets talk at 9 on what the status of the case is--find 
some trade press articles first thing mon. AM and don't bug Janet quite yet.  
Sounds like Bill has arranged a briefing by the NB people for our benefit  
(and probably an argument about whether we should intervene).  Thanks.  DF

Who in certificates has looked at the issues of using our compreesor turbines 
to generate electricity??
Also has anyone in Legal done any research on PUHCA issues.
I was just speaking with Bob Burleson and Rod Hayslett about these issues.  
Rod said that Danny is very interested and is considering power generation on 
the Florida system.  Do you know who from legal is on that team?
i assume there may be marketing affiliate isues also ??

Am I the only one having a deja vu experience?  I know you can't believe what 
you read, but the trade press makes it sound like capacity to California is 
worth about a zillion bucks--are we sure we want to do this???? DF

Natural-gas Prices Hit Astonishing Highs; Will Coal and Nuclear Benefit?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

According to a Dec. 5 report in the Wall Street Journal, natural-gas prices=
,
which already had been rising all year, shot up 11.4 percent to an all-time
high of $20 per million BTUs on Monday at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Today, reports are circulating that spot prices at the Southern California
border reached an astounding $41 on Wednesday, breaking the Daily Gas Price
Index's all-time record high of $39. The sharp increases are viewed as
a reaction to cold weather in the Northeast and forecasts of more to come.
Projections continue to indicate that natural-gas customers will see sharp
increases in their heating bills very soon. The current increase has result=
ed
from a volatile mixture of rising demand and decreased supplies for natural
gas, which has driven up prices by a total of 218.9 percent, or more than
$5, since a year ago. The uncertain future of natural-gas supplies may
be a contributing factor to an unexpected resurgence of interest in coal-fi=
red
and nuclear power.

ANALYSIS: Unfortunately, we are starting to see real evidence of the projec=
ted
rise in natural-gas prices, just as temperatures start to take their downwa=
rd
slope across most of the United States. Two months ago, the Department
of Energy predicted that households using natural gas would see the largest
year-on-year percentage increase in their bills, with prices rising about
40 percent on average. We've actually been seeing the price increase since
June of this year, when natural-gas hit a then-unprecedented mark of $4.686
per million BTUs. At that time, it was a shock to see those kinds of spikes
for natural gas, especially since the energy source is typically used mostl=
y
in the wintertime for heating. Yet, now as we move into the coldest months
of the season, I project that the all-time-highs of $20 to $40 per million
BTUs are something that might become all too common for the near term.

The Wall Street Journal article on the price spikes also reported that
the American Gas Association estimated that, as of Nov. 24, there were
about 2.502 trillion cubic feet of gas in storage. This represented an
11-percent decrease from the five-year average for that date. The United
States is mostly self-reliant when it comes to natural-gas supplies and,
as I've discussed in previous columns, the fact that a reported 60 percent
of federal lands has been placed off limits for natural-gas drilling certai=
nly
adds to the concern about future supplies. The Clinton administration and
environmental groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands
and prohibited drilling for natural gas (or oil) in states like Alaska,
where some 36 trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground.


Yet, at the same time, substitute forms of power generation, such as coal
and nuclear, have been restricted or downgraded in favor of natural gas,
which has only exacerbated the current demand on supply. EPA standards
have become so pro-natural gas over the last decade that few coal-fired
plants have been built in the last 10-20 years. Certainly, the public=20
resistance
toward nuclear power has been well documented, which has thwarted any plann=
ed
production of a new nuclear plant.

Ironically, it seems to me that we now find ourselves at a crossroads in
this industry that may in fact lead to a resurgence of coal-fired and nucle=
ar
power. Especially in states such as Texas and Oklahoma, which are very
reliant on natural-gas supplies, the current uncertainty about the=20
availability
of natural gas and reasonable prices poses a major dilemma. Despite the
recent trend of moving away from these two forms of power, I can point
to several developments indicating that the current predicament could creat=
e
a forced reliance on these power substitutes.

First, let's look at coal. It's been widely postulated that coal is cheaper
and easier to produce than natural gas, and its supplies are certainly
more abundant. As recently as this year, coal has accounted for about 54
percent of the electricity produced in the United States, although that
majority-hold over power production has come under attack. Emission=20
requirements
have forced many generators to shut down or minimize the use of their=20
coal-fired
generating stations. In fact, a group of seven utilities=01*AEP, Cinergy,
Illinois Power, Southern Indiana Gas & Electric, Southern Company, and
Tampa Electric Company=01*have been hit with a lawsuit by the EPA, claiming
that they contributed to some of the most severe environmental problems
facing certain parts of the United States. Specifically, the EPA has claime=
d
that the utilities violated the Clean Air Act with emissions from their
coal-fired power plants.

Currently, while natural-gas prices have soared, coal prices have remained
comparatively low and stable. In addition, clean coal technologies are
being put into place to reduce the amount of particulates released from
coal-fired plants. As a result, many generating companies are hedging their
bets that the rise in natural gas prices will continue by maintaining or
increasing their coal-fired generation. For example, AEP is the nation's
leading consumer of coal. Reportedly, about 67 percent of AEP's electric
generation is made at coal-fired plants. In response to the natural-gas
price spikes, AEP confirmed that it will continue to operate all of its
coal-fired plants at full capacity, despite the ongoing lawsuit from the
EPA.

Proponents of coal are using the so-called "natural gas crisis" as an=20
opportunity
to argue that electricity from coal can be provided at about half the cost
of other fossil fuels and is less costly and more reliable than intermitten=
t
power sources such as wind and solar. In addition, coal proponents say
that the cost of electricity would double if the United States were to
replace all existing coal-generated power plants with alternative forms
of power.

Nuclear power also could stand to benefit from the comprised supplies and
high prices of natural gas. Following the growing interest among several
European and Asian countries, several U.S. utilities have expressed recent
interest in expanding their nuclear assets. Corbin McNeill, co-head of
Exelon Corp., on Monday stated that new nuclear plants are needed and one
will definitely be built in the next five to 10 years. McNeill also noted
that the question of whether a new nuclear plant was built would depend
on a sustained increase in prices for natural gas, which remains the curren=
t
fuel of choice for new power plants. However, he rejected the notion that
building new nuclear plants would require the Energy Department's Yucca
Mountain spent fuel repository to be operational, an event that probably
won't happen until 2010.

Entergy is another example of a company that continues to aggressively
pursue nuclear power and may spark other companies to do the same in respon=
se
to high natural-gas prices. In late November, Entergy announced that it
would submit a counteroffer for the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant, which
is already in the midst of being sold to rival buyer AmerGen Energy (the
joint venture between Exelon and British Energy). Entergy, which has been
developing a strong nuclear platform for some time, believes that the=20
Northeastern
United States offers a strong market potential for nuclear power, and plans
to increase its offer for the Yankee plant and trump AmerGen's standing
offer of $93.8 million.

The next few months, especially as temperatures continue to drop, should
be very telling on two counts. First, will we continue to see the=20
record-breaking
prices for natural gas? (I say yes). Second, what impact will these price
spikes have on coal and nuclear? I think they should only have a positive
impact on future development of these two forms of power. However, the
question is whether or not new production of coal and nuclear can be put
into place fast enough to minimize the potentially disastrous impact from
the low supplies and resultant rising prices of natural gas. Only time
will have the answer to these questions.

I don't see any problem with this transaction since it appears to be limited 
to Louisiana assets, but the issue of whether we are impacted by the 
noncompete agreement strikes me as a commercial call.  Please let me know if

IssueAlert for  March 8, 2001 

Problems Mount for Sierra Pacific Resources,
Acquisition of Portland General Appears Uncertain

by Will McNamara 
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

The probability appears to be getting smaller that Sierra Pacific Resources 
(NYSE: SRP) will complete its $3.1 billion acquisition of Portland General 
Electric (NYSE: PGB) from Enron (NYSE: ENE). Enron disclosed in an 8K filing 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Feb. 27 that the sale of 
Portland General had been delayed because of "recent events" in California 
and Nevada that affected Sierra Pacific. Walt Higgins, chair and CEO of 
Sierra Pacific Resources, told Wall Street analysts that the acquisition 
agreement will terminate if it has not closed by May 1. 

Analysis: Yesterday I wrote about the apparent collapse of the merger between 
Consolidated Edison and Northeast Utilities (NU). Now, another high-profile 
merger appears to be unraveling. As with the Con Edison / NU deal, the 
problem facing Sierra Pacific Resources' pending purchase of Portland General 
from Enron is based in economics. Namely, it appears that Sierra Pacific 
Resources' recent financial problems have cast doubt on the company's ability 
to complete its purchase of Portland General. This is not a good development 
for Sierra Pacific Resources, as the financial and legal implications of this 
potentially dead acquisition could exacerbate the company's current financial 
problems.  

First, let me provide some background on this deal. The origin of Sierra 
Pacific Resources' attempt to acquire Portland General date back to November 
1999. Enron had purchased the company in 1997 as a strategic move to 
facilitate its intent to play a major role in the retail markets of 
California and the Pacific Northwest. At the time, Enron saw itself as a 
prototype for the future of the energy industry, adding transmission and 
distribution capabilities as well as more diversified fuel resources to its 
already successful wholesale marketing core. Stymied by the slow start of 
competition in California and Oregon, Enron underwent a transformation in its 
corporate philosophy. Under the growing direction of Jeffrey Skilling, Enron 
no longer believed that it needed to own hard assets to retain its place in 
the top tier of energy companies. That philosophy has served Enron well, as 
its success in nearly all of its business sectors has been well documented. 

Yet, Enron's transformation opened the door for Sierra Pacific Resources, a 
relatively small and regionally based holding company, to move in for a 
purchase of Portland General. Owning Portland General made more sense for 
Sierra Pacific Resources than it did for Enron. Portland General, which 
provides electric service to over 700,000 customers in the Portland-Salem 
area, was viewed as a good acquisition target as it would help Sierra Pacific 
Resources to gain scale and a foothold in two fast-growing states (Nevada and 
Oregon). Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to pay Enron $2.1 billion for 
Portland General, which included $2.02 billion in cash and assumption of 
Enron's $80 million merger payment obligation. In addition, Sierra Pacific 
Resources agreed to assume $1 billion in Portland General debt and preferred 
stock, taking the total value of the purchase to $3.1 billion. Portland 
General appeared happy with the scheduled sale from Enron, acknowledging that 
its own core business "delivering safe and reliable power with a customer 
service focus" was more in line with Sierra Pacific Resources.  

However, a number of economic factors on Sierra Pacific Resources' side of 
the table seem to be thwarting this acquisition. As I discussed in the Feb. 
22 IssueAlert (available at www.consultrci.com), Sierra Pacific Resources 
reported a significant fourth-quarter loss ($18.2 million) as a result of 
soaring costs of power in the western United States. The company incurred 
losses as a direct result of "the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased 
power in the volatile wholesale market." As a result, Sierra Pacific 
Resources filed with state regulators for an emergency rate increase. 
"Without some rate relief, the cost of fuel and power is close to crippling 
our ability to serve the needs of our customers," said Mark Ruelle, the 
company's chief financial officer. The company attributed the latest 
quarter's loss to nearly $258 million of unanticipated fuel and purchased 
power costs. 

Specifically, Sierra Pacific Resources reported a 4Q 2000 loss of $18.2 
million, or 23 cents a share. This compared with a profit of $26.8 million, 
or 39 cents a share, excluding a $56 million deferred energy write-off a year 
ago. Including the write-off, the company reported a loss of $29.2 million, 
or 42 cents a share, in 4Q 1999. For year-end 2000, the company reported a 
net loss of $39.8 million or 51 cents per share, a 177-percent drop from 
1999. 

In addition, the company's stock has fallen steadily over the last few weeks 
(at one point, dropping 11.8 percent to $10.80 on the New York Stock Exchange 
Feb. 7). At the close of trading on March 7, shares of Sierra Pacific 
Resources were priced at $13.80, which is still down from its 52-week high of 
$19.43 and book value of $17.82. The drop in stock price could make it 
difficult for Sierra Pacific Resources to secure the financing necessary to 
complete the purchase of Portland General. 

Meanwhile, Sierra Pacific Resources' available cash flow could be impacted by 
possible restrictions placed on the sale of its power plants. The Public 
Utility Commission of Nevada (PUCN) mandated divestiture as a condition of 
the 1999 merger between Nevada Power Co. and Sierra Pacific Power Co, which 
created the holding company Sierra Pacific Resources. Toward that end, the 
holding company and its wholly owned utility subsidiaries commenced a public 
auction of approximately 2,900 MW of power generation facilities. Of Sierra 
Pacific Resources' nine power plants, which are mostly fired by natural gas 
and coal, seven have been entered into sales agreements to companies such as 
Dynegy and NRG and will be sold upon final regulatory approval.   

However, over the last few weeks, there has been growing concern that Nevada 
regulators would not approve pending sales or authorize the sale of 
additional power plants by Sierra Pacific Resources, thus preventing the 
company from using the proceeds to pay for the acquisition of Portland 
General. Perhaps out of fears about depleting the Nevada's power supply, the 
Attorney General's Bureau of Consumer Protection, the Southern Nevada Water 
Authority and the AFL-CIO have urged that the sale of the plants be delayed 
or canceled. Further, Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn has called on the PUCN to 
reconsider the 1999 order that required Sierra Pacific Resources to sell the 
plants owned by its two utilities, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power. Any 
available cash that Sierra Pacific Resources was planning to use from the 
power plant sales to support its acquisition of Portland General may not 
materialize if the sales agreements are delayed or terminated. 

Ironically, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power Co. just received approval 
from the PUCN to secure $1.4 billion in bank loans, bond financing and 
preferred securities. However, due to agreements that the utilities 
previously made, none of the borrowed money may be used, directly or 
indirectly, to financially support its parent's acquisition of Portland 
General.  

Thus, Sierra Pacific Resources seems to be between a rock and a hard place 
regarding this purchase, which it apparently still wants to complete. It 
would appear that Sierra Pacific Resources will have difficulty financing the 
purchase of Portland General due to the combination of its significant 
financial losses, plunging stock prices and possible restrictions against the 
sale of its power plants. Presumably, these are the "recent events" to which 
Enron referred in its SEC filing.  

It is fairly clear that Enron no longer wishes to own Portland General and 
believes that the company does not fit into its strategy for continuing 
growth. What remains in question, however, is what will happen if Sierra 
Pacific Resources' pending acquisition is not completed by the May 1 
deadline, thus terminating the sales agreement. The problems associated with 
the Con Edison / NU merger are leading to litigation. One can't help but 
think that lawsuits would be inevitable in the Enron / Portland General / 
Sierra Pacific Resources case as well, as Enron presumably would seek to be 
compensated in some way for the $3.1 billion that the deal includes.  

Further complicating matters for Sierra Pacific Resources is a growing 
movement to municipalize the electric markets in Las Vegas and Henderson, 
Nev. On Jan. 11, the Southern Nevada Water Authority suggested that the 
agency could become a public power authority. Pat Mulroy, general manager of 
the water authority, recommended that the agency buy power on wholesale 
markets and possibly generate electricity from some of its own power plants 
to serve cities in the area. Efforts to municipalize electric systems in the 
southern half of the state could potentially gain momentum if Sierra Pacific 
Resources' financial problems worsen.

Jeff,
Thank you for the referral of the Citizens Kingman, Arizona project to Enron 
Asset Management Resources (EAMR), the new ETS service company, for further 
development.  We appreciate your willingness to "stay in the loop" with the 
project since you have the relationship with the customer.  

It is not often that we have the opportunity to take over the operation of a 
facility before in-service.  This is a great opportunity to operate assets 
that do not have a long and potentially risky environmental history, so we 
are excited about this opportunity.

This bid proposal is envisioned to be a joint effort between Operations and 
Market Services to:
Identify the functions required to perform the requested services
Price the delivered services
Identify the risks associated with performing the services 
Mitigate and/or price in adequate compensation for the risks

As the project is kicked off, we enter the information gathering stage to 
determine the configuration of the facility and the service requirements.
I have placed a call to Citizens to initiate this effort and will keep you 
informed of developments.

Julia, 
I am assuming that Donna Scott will be the primary contact for this joint 
development and that she will coordinate Market Service's efforts, therefore, 
she is copied on this e-mail.  Let me know if you have any changes to this 
approach.

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Guardian Pipeline said it bought five engine compressor packages totaling 
22,225 hp to provide natural gas compression on its 141-mile, 660 MMcf/d 
pipeline in Illinois and Wisconsin. It purchased the compressors from 
Compressor Systems, Inc. of Midland, TX. Combined, the compressors will be 
capable of delivering up to 750 MMcf/d of gas on Guardian. "Guardian Pipeline 
is continuing to make steady progress. This purchase agreement for a major 
equipment component keeps Guardian on track to meet its scheduled in-service 
date of November 2002," said George Hass, Guardian project manager. A final 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision on the Guardian Pipeline 
is expected by early 2001. In June, FERC issued a Preliminary Determination 
that the pipeline is in the public interest, subject to the outcome of its 
environmental review, and in July, FERC staff issued a favorable Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement on the project. In addition, the Public 
Service Commission of Wisconsin made a preliminary dete
rmination on the project in October, accepting the economics of a Wisconsin 
Gas lateral pipeline, which will connect Guardian with Wisconsin Gas' 
distribution system. Guardian will transport gas from interconnections with 
Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern, and NGPL at the Chicago hub near 
Joliet, IL, to northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin markets starting in 
November 2002. Its sponsors include CMS, WICOR and Viking Gas.

Got a call from Dennis out of the blue this afternoon.  He's pretty gung ho, 
and also alluded to several other projects he's got on the front burner 
(gas-fired power deals).  He had met again with some DOE folks in DC about 
the power contract and feels it is 70-80% locked in.  Have you ever known a 
project developer who would admit to less than 70-80% odds???  I look forward 
to talking on Tuesday.  DF

I reviewed the latest draft of AA's management rep. letter and caught a few  
innaccuracies in the way AA described the deal.  I attach a revised draft of 
the letter, with a redline version to highlight for you the changes I think 
we need to make to keep it accurate.  First, AA only listed two of the four 
agreements that comprise the deal.  They apparently forgot that we had 
created a second SBA.  Additionally, at Transcanada's request, we put the 
transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year.  You will recall 
that last year, Sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the SBA.  

Second, AA's bullet no. 4, as originally drafted, states that Northern does 
not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term 
of the agreement.  That statement is confusing given that Article VI.B of the 
Monthly Pack Agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is 
a form of purchase option.  That cash out mechanism was in Kent's bullets 
describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that AA 
looked at, so I assume they are OK with the mechanism and were just inartful 
in drafting bullet no. 4.   My simple fix was to leave AA's language alone 
but to add an "except for" reference at the beginning of bullet no. 4.    

Third, AA's draft of bullet nos. 5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous 
references to "other agreements" and "additional agreements" respectively.   
Since AA's list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete, 
these references in bullet nos. 5 and 6 were also innacurate.  Now that I 
have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete, I've 
clarified the bullets by adding the "other than those agreements referenced 
above" language to both bullets.  The couple of other changes in bullet 5 
simply clarify the meaning.  

Finally, I've modified the signature blocks per conversation with Bill to 
delete MKM and myself.  I am certainly willing and able to sign this letter, 
but MKM is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements.  
Getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time.  
Additionally, Bill's thought was that MKM and I are his direct reports 
anyway, so it doesn't serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the 
top guy has signed.   

Please give me a call if you have any questions or want to discuss these 
matters.

Shelley, Dale explained to Tony and I that the term "indicative data" should 
be included.  This term is a term of art to the traders and means data which 
relates to certain trading characteristics, such as how often, whether the 
trades are made in groups, etc.  (Dale can give you a more detailed 
explanation.)  Thus, this term would cover some things which "transactional 
data" may not cover.  Given these facts, Tony and I had included it in the 
original writeup.  Your edit of the last is sentence is fine, however, 
perhaps we should add "indicative data" back in to make sure we are covered.

Tony, please add any comments you have.

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of a policy to be distributed

basis upon which the policy is based is that the activities identified in the 
policy are currently performed by ENA employees. Of course, we still need to 
talk about this issue.

Jim - 
Great job on the Oelwein Incident presentation at the Safety Coordinators 
Workshop. I believe we all recognize that there is some legal risk in taking 
this proactive posture; I believe the risk to our employees is greater if we 
don't present lessons learned in a clear and prompt  manner. The comments I 
heard were very favorable, and many could relate this incident to ones they 
had been involved in. 

I love your standard opening of an open invite for an attorney joke, but of 
course am shocked that we would have field employees who have a joke ready!

Again, this sharing of information at this stage of the game adds 
considerable integrity to all of management.

Thanks again
Mike

I fielded a call today from Mr. Rob Cooper of U.S. Gypsum.  Mr. Cooper

Red Rock expansion capacity.  Moreover, Mr. Cooper has been in contact with 
SoCal Gas in order that SoCal Gas recognize firm deliveries from Transwestern 
at Needles in excess of the current (sustainable) limit of 750 MMcf/d. 

Mr. Cooper insists that he is making progress with SoCal Gas aimed at lifting 
the 750 window to 760, and that SoCal Gas has indicated U.S. Gypsum would be 
entitled to an exclusive right to the increased amount.   While trying not to 
be argumentative, I told Mr. Cooper that if SoCal Gas was willing to set 
aside a discrete increment of capacity for a single shipper, it would be a 
radical departure from current SoCal Gas policy.  Currently, SoCal Gas does 
not provide unbundled intrastate transmission.  They have only accepted or 
not accepted pipeline nominations, as the case may be, as an aggregate 
volume, with no distinction being drawn on who the upstream shippers were.

I set about to try to explain that there is no correlation (other than 
coincidental timing) between (1) TW discussions with SoCal Gas at raising the 
capacity window at Needles and (2) TW's effort to sell Red Rock Expansion 
space.  In addition, I attempted to explain that TW feels it will be required 
to follow certain rules pursuant to its tariff and FERC policy associated 
with making new delivery point capacity available on a non-discriminatory 
basis.  With respect to this issue, I told Mr. Cooper that, although we're 
currently discussing it, we'd yet to come to any decision on how, if 
incremental capacity does become available at Needles, TW would make such 
delivery point capacity available to its shippers.  

Mr. Cooper then proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how, if that's the 
case, then "he's wasted 3 weeks in active negotiations" with both SoCal Gas 
and TW aimed at securing capacity at Needles.  He said on several occasions 
that "end game" for him was to secure a firm portal from the interstate 
system onto and through the SoCal Gas system.  Mr. Cooper also expressed a 
concern that if he's forced into a competitive bidding situation with other 
big marketing companies (in his words, "such as ENA") for Needles capacity, 
then he probably couldn't compete, and once again, would be left on the 
outside looking in.  He pointed to the El Paso Merchant deal on EPNG as a 
prime example.  

Mr. Cooper said he wasn't ready to accept my explanation as to why TW 
couldn't commit to offering U.S. Gypsum an exclusive right to any incremental 
Needles capacity, and asked that I formally "run it up the flagpole" to 
senior management and get back with him by telephone with TW's "official 
position."   As an editorial comment, I'm not sure Mr. Cooper completely 
understands (or cares about) the landscape here.  I'd go so far as to say 
that from his style and the tone of his conversation with me, he won't easily 
take "no" or even a "maybe" as an answer.   The difficulty for TW is going to 
be in trying to persuade him that we're interested in his business and 
sympathize with his position, but that we face real legal and/or regulatory 
issues here, and they cannot be dismissed or ignored by U.S. Gypsum or any 
other customer.

I'd like to be in a position to call him back on Friday and give him TW's 
"official position" on his request for Needles service in the Red Rock 
expansion.  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Help?

Subject: Update on Marketing affiliate Conference


As you know, the marketing affiliate conference is still set for January 31.  
The Alliance of Energy Suppliers (EEI's generation arm) has filed a letter to 
postpone to conference.  The Commission hasn't acted on this request, so at 
this point the conference is still on.  Interestingly, the FERC hasn't issued 
a notice of the panel participants yet.  Bob Flanders of FERC says not to 
expect the notice before Monday -- so maybe there is some hope of this being 
canceled yet.  

In the meantime, INGAA is moving forward to prepare for the conference.   
Speakers friendly to our cause include INGAA - Joan Dreskin, AGA, Williams - 
Scott Turkington, and ENA.  Dominion is a mixed bag.  They oppose more strict 
rules -- but since they have already been applied in their merger, they may 
also say that such conditions should be applied to all.  

Joan Dreskin's comments will be very generic in opposition to rule changes 
and WIlliams will be fairly negative.  I'm afraid they come off as a bit too 
defensive.   So, basically the best case will likely be made by Leslie Lawner 
of ENA.   She knows the % capacity that ENA holds on our pipes.  She is aware 
of transactional data that is out there.  She has been briefed on the 
Dominion merger conditions (extension of the rules of all affiliates, logs of 
affiliate communications and visits, etc).  

I know that you probably already read Jan's summary of comments.  If you are 
interested, here are INGAA's working papers.

 - List of Roundtable Participants.doc
 - marketing affiliate comments 1-09-01.doc
 - Questions.doc

Please let me know next week if there is any specific point or argument (e.g. 
Drew's Funny Money email) that we would like to ask Joan or Leslie to 
raise.   Otherwise, I expect that we will have the opportunity to file a 
detailed reply after the conference.

SCIENTECH IssueAlert, November 10, 2000
Public Service Company of New Mexico to Acquire the Electric Utility 
Operations
of Western Resources
By: Jon T. Brock, Director, Strategic and Competitive Intelligence
===============================================================

Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) announced yesterday that it
intends to acquire the electric utility operations of Topeka, Kansas based
Western Resources (WR) in a tax-free stock-for-stock transaction.  The
deal will require that WR separate its non-utility assets from its regulated
utility business and spin it off to WR shareholders.

ANALYSIS:  In this day and age of a consolidating electric industry, strategic
combinations are becoming more commonplace.  This announcement took me
by surprise even though the signs were clearly marked for this type of
merger.  WR has had a tough time financially in recent years and has been
seeking a utility operations buyer for some time now.

WR busted up a planned merger between Kansas City based KCPL and UtiliCorp
United by attempting to acquire KCPL in 1996.  At the time WR share price
was above $30.  In 1997 WR share price soared to record highs of more than
$40.  WR attempted to acquire security company ADT but their bid failed.
 They sold their interest in ADT for a $800 million profit.  This profit
"masked" a rate review by the Kansas Corporation Commission that at the
time was cutting WR rates by $75 million, reducing earnings by 75 cents
per share.

WR, who obviously had a strategic focus on security, used the profits from
the ADT sale to purchase 85 percent of Protection One, one of the fastest
growing companies in the monitored security business.  Protection One hit
some hard times soon after the purchase by WR and as a result, their stock
tumbled.  WR investors became nervous when state and federal regulators
began discussing terms of the KCPL merger that might not necessarily be
favorable to them.  As a result, some moved their money out of WR and by
1999, WR share price had tumbled to $16 to $17.  In January of this year,
KCPL determined that the share price of WR and the financial considerations
of the merger were not advantageous to KCPL shareholders and called off
the merger.

WR immediately split itself into two organizations (regulated utility 
operations
and non-regulated business) with the intent of finding a buyer for the
regulated utility operations.  WR claimed in June of this year that 50
companies were being courted, including international companies, for the
utility operations assets of Kansas Power & Light (KPL) and Kansas Gas
and Electric (KGE).  Putting PNM on that list had not occurred to me.
But it does fit.

SCIENTECH interviewed Jeff Sterba, CEO of PNM, just weeks ago and asked
if the development of alliances, mergers, and acquisitions were a part
of the positive approach to PNM's strategy.  Jeff answered, "Very definitely.
Alliances focused on the things that are core to your business, and that
can bring a sustainable, competitive advantage are essential for us in
this industry.  The criticality of market channels can't be over-emphasized.
 Once you have a good market channel, that doesn't mean that everything
you put through that market channel you have to do yourself, or you have
to own. You can expand that reach to customers by forming alliances.  There
are times when acquisitions can also be an important investment if it involves
something that is core to your business. So, both alliances and acquisitions
will be a part of PNM's future."

Just weeks later PNM is buying WR.  Utilizing my rear view mirror now I
see the existing similarities between the assets of WR and PNM.  They both
operate regulated utilities with a generation fuel mix (including nuclear).
 They both have multi-commodity in electric and gas.  They both have wholesale
operations.  PNM actually has had a great year financially due in part
to a strong wholesale operation.  PNM net earnings for the nine months
ended Sept. 30, 2000 totaled $86.9 million, or $2.17 per share (diluted)
on total operating revenues of $1.15 billion, compared to earnings of $66.2
million, or $1.60 per share in the first three quarters of 1999.

PNM has adopted a "niche" strategy in the wholesale power market by developing
tailored wholesale power products for its customers.  While some of the
mega-traders in the wholesale market thrive on volume and a standard 
commodity,
PNM differentiates itself by creating a tailored power product according
to the needs of the buyer.  PNM has found success in this niche segment
of a large wholesale market.

The merger deal is expected to take between 12 and 15 months to complete.
 PNM will inherit approximately $2.9 billion in debt making the total value
of the deal worth $4.4 billion.  Fitch has placed its securities ratings
of PNM on Rating Watch Negative and WR on Rating Watch Evolving.  Fitch
plans to meet with PNM management soon in order to assess the full impact
of the merger.  Apparently some regulatory concern exists in Kansas where
deregulation has not occurred and where some rate inconsistencies exist
between Wichita and Topeka.  This may result in a rate case.  It should
also be noted that Wichita, Kansas currently has an ongoing effort to takeover
(municipalize) the electric system from Western Resources within its city
limits because of the rate disparity between Wichita and Topeka.  Wichita
has about 170,000 power customers -- roughly a fourth of all the customers
served by Western Resources. They represent more than $370 million of KGE's
$580 million in revenues.

PNM will increase its debt but is committed to reducing that debt and has
demonstrated its ability to do so.  PNM has decreased its debt-to-capital
ratio from 72 percent to less than 55 percent in the last seven years.
 The headquarters will be based in Albuquerque, NM and the chairman, 
president,
and chief executive officer will be Jeff Sterba.

CRECers,

Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his
emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a
number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift
emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have
met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E
reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate
reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline
transportation to the CA border.

I'm OK with this agreement.  Christine, I appreciate your explanation of how 
we developed the rate.  Hopefully, once FERC approves our purchase and sale 
of options, we can price them as a stand alone service.  For now, including 
the optionality as a bundled component of the total discounted rate--as we 
did here--is appropriate.

Team

I have summarized in the margins of our DRAFT deal structure the "high level" 
issues that Gail Tholen, Jin and I discussed on Thursday.   These are 
preliminary guidelines and as our deal evolves and our partner's desires 
change, we will have to potentially address completely different accounting, 
regulatory and tax issues.     We hope to touch on some of the issues that 
this structure may raise from a Regulatory perspective with Drew Fossom when 
we meet next Tuesday at 10:00AM.  

Please comment and advise as you see fit.

Thanks

-John

This may have been the case in others, but the IOS does say that it bid, if 
less than max is not available.  If Drew and Susan are ok to sign off, I can 
go with that and we do need to be specfic as to what we are going to include 
in the contract in the IOS package.  Lets hope it doesn't come back to bite 
us, assuming Drew and Susan sign off.  MK

Subject: Re: Transwestern Contract Approval Request  

Mary Kay -  In all of Transwestern's previous Interactive Open Seasons, the 
only capacity which Transwestern had posted for bid purposes was the primary 
capacity - no associated alternate flexibility was ever posted as being 
available to the bidders.  We have traditionally relied on verbal 
communication, only if asked by the shipper,  of any potential alternate 
rights associated with the primary capacity being auctioned.  I do not feel 
that in this recent IOS process that any shipper had possibly NOT increased 
their bid due to the impression that there was no additional flexibility 
beyond  the primary path rights of the capacity being auctioned.  However,  I 
do think that the TW commercial group should discuss how we communicate to 
any interested party those alternate rights  associated with future IOS bids 
or EnronOnline bids.   Thank you for your comment, please contact me if you 
need any additional feedback.

I understand that this capacity is what was posted on the IOS, however,  
these alternate point rights were not included in the posting as available, 
is there a concern that not all were aware of this and therefore they could 
have bid differently ?  MK

Drew -- HH did leave me the new lawyer's name and # so let's discuss whether 
we should phone him once Howard is safely on the plane to Costa Rica.  In the 
meantime, Lorraine already asked Meaders for the cases Howard cited, but he 
said he'd have to consult with his lawyers in order to do that, so I'm sure 
the answer will be "no."  Snooping around at FERC is starting to sound like a 
good idea, but I'm in uncharted territory here so won't do any of that before 
discussing it with you.

Ugh.  We'll keep working this angle if their new attorney shows up on deck, 
but I think Susan and I have done as much as can be done with Howard H.  Do 
any of you know what the Red Cedar facilities look like?  I.e. how many miles 
of line, any big diameter line, any compression, etc?  Howard must have read 
some old cases and gotten himself spooked that their facilites aren't 
gathering under the modified primary function test.  I'm not sure why he 
thinks signing a transport contract with us will make their situation any 
worse, but that seems to be his conclusion.  If Steve and Bill can't nudge 
Red Cedar's management into doing the deal, I'd suggest that you both or one 
of you ask Tsuri (sp?) to have his new lawyer call me and Susan after Howard 
leaves, maybe with one of the Kinder Morgan lawyers on the phone also, and 
we'll try to straighten this out.

I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation 
with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder 
Morgan lawyers.

Attached for your review is Jim Peters' rough draft. Jim tried to design it 
in such a way as to be as generic as possible, with the idea that factual 
differences between the parties would be put in the footnotes.  I am 
concerned he may be overreaching with regard to the legal objection, where he 
refers to TW/Northern as a "nonresident", given that (as I understand it) 
Northern and/or TW have facilities in Oklahoma.  There are also some 
grammatical changes that I would make.

I wonder if I could get ya'll to take a look at this and have you participate 
with me in a telephone conference with Jim later this afternoon?  If Drew, 
Jim or Bob could let me know what time would be convenient, I'll get it set 
up.  Many thanks.

Has the old adversary adopted an "if you can't beat em, join em" strategy?  I 
noticed that CNG is planning to build some high deliverability storage.  More 
competition is always a problem, but at least that is a vindication of the 
MHP strategy.  I noticed Vaina was quoted in the trade press.  Is he the man 
on Tioga now?  DF

Subject: daily firm on TW

The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer 
than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily 
firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for 
consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the 
other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a 
certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able 
to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."  In contractual terms all this 
would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), 
and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I 
see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in 
marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month 
period.)

I have been updated by Susan on her (largely futile) efforts to push ECS on 
the $200k we think they owe us.  Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday 
with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this.  If 
I understand ECS' position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and 
delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS' 
fault that manual peak monitoring wasn't operational until December .  That 
argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of 
warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right?  At 
minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to 
get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied.  But we heard nothing.  Is 
that our story?  

If its going to take me doing some yelling at Knippa or Steve and Rod talking 
to Redmond, lets decide what the script is and get it done.

Marathon and Phillips Join Protest

    Two more shippers have joined Amoco and Burlington Resources in their
joint protest against El Paso?s decision to sell to Enron 1.2 Bcf of excess
capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. Marathon and Phillips have
joined in the protest, attacking the entire deal as anti-competitive. The
protesters hope FERC will force El Paso to begin again with capacity
assignments. Amoco and Burlington had already protested the deal two weeks
ago at FERC, when they claimed the sale would violate El Paso?s rate case
settlement and tariff. The shippers argue that El Paso was trying to sell
part of that primary firm capacity at delivery points other than
PG&E/Topock), which the settlement prohibits. The settlement was intended to
protect PG&E and allow it to access service. If this capacity is delivered at
other points such as SoCal/Topock, it could add to the glut at that point,
the protesters argued. El Paso and Enron stand to gain if the basis
differential between the San Juan Basin and California remains large.
Marathon and Phillips say that Enron and El Paso can manipulate that basis
differential because between them and their affiliates they control all the
excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California.

Speculators Reduce Long Ratio

    Speculators have reduced the size of their bets on rising NYMEX crude oil
futures during the two weeks ending last year. Speculator long positions now
outnumber short positions by 1.4 to 1 compared with a ratio of 2.9 to 1 two
weeks earlier and 3.8 to 1 four weeks earlier. Prices peaked at a
post-Gulf-War high of $27.15 a barrel November 22nd and ended the year at
$25.60. Long positions in crude oil futures on the NYMEX held by hedge funds
and large speculators were 44,233 on December 28th, little changed from
44,693 on December 14th, according to the CFTC. Speculator short positions
doubled, though, to 31,868 from 15,364. Speculators also became less bullish
about both gasoline and heating oil as their short positions increased much
more than the long positions did during the two-week period. The ratio of
longs to shorts in gasoline fell to about 3-to-2 from 20-to-1. For natural
gas, speculators increased their overall bet that gas prices would fall. They
had placed bets for rising gas prices from April until mid-November, when a
lack of severe cold weather demand pulled prices down from a two-year high.
The following table shows the changes in speculator positions for crude oil,
heating oil, gasoline and natural gas futures.

Statoil Sells E&P Business to Equitable

    Equitable Resources, has acquired Statoil Energy?s Appalachian Basin Gas
Exploration and Production subsidiaries, Eastern States Exploration Company
and Eastern States Oil and Gas for $630 million. The transaction is expected
to close in February. The sale includes natural gas reserves totaling
approximately 1.1 Tcf, 6,500 production wells, and 4,000 miles of pipeline
network in Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Sale of the
exploration and production business is the first step in The Statoil Group?s
overall plan of complete divestment of Statoil Energy. Statoil Energy?s
remaining businesses, power generation, energy marketing and trading,  will
be offered for sale in a separate process starting later this month. The
divestment plan is part of Statoil?s overall restructuring program to
concentrate on its core business activities: exploration and production in
Norway and other selected areas of the world; the European natural gas and
energy business; crude oil trading, refining and marketing; and
petrochemicals. Equitable?s market capitalization is $1.1 billion.

EPRI Launches Customized Technical Support Services Subsidiary

   A new subsidiary of the Electric Power Research Institute will offer
customized technical support services to both members and non-members of its
research program. EPRIsolutions is a for-profit subsidiary created to hasten
the application of EPRI technologies already developed through decades of
collaborative research. EPRIsolutions will work directly with our customers
to select, install and support the EPRI technologies most suitable for their
particular needs. Many of the services offered will be performed by the staff
of EPRI?s Technology Application Centers located throughout the US. For
example, the Engineering and Test Centers in Lenox, Mass. and Haslet, Tex.
can provide audits of utility power delivery systems to identify weaknesses
before they lead to outages. The Maintenance and Diagnostics Center in
Charlotte, N.C. can help customers save on the cost of operating and
maintaining their fossil-fired power plants. As an example of how such
integrated services will be offered, EPRIsolutions can help customers adapt
and install the powerful, sophisticated software packages now available for
load forecasting, environmental risk assessment, and retail market
management. In some cases, EPRIsolutions will go one step further by acting
as an application service provider for companies that want to outsource
data-intensive operations. The first such ASP activity will be on-line
monitoring and diagnosis of water chemistry for several nuclear power plants.
EPRIsolutions is being formed through the merger of two existing
subsidiaries, EPRICSG and EPRIGEN, which were created to allow EPRI to
conduct proprietary R&D on behalf of individual funders, who would retain
rights to the intellectual property involved. In addition to continuing this
activity, EPRIsolutions takes on the function of providing customized
technology application and consulting services. Such private-benefit work
lies beyond the scope of EPRI's tax-exempt, collaborative research mission
and thus requires the use of a taxable subsidiary.

HEAD?S UP? PRICES DOWN!

    Natural gas prices have fallen to $2.40/MMBtu from $3.20/MMBtu just last
month. Storage injections still outweigh storage withdrawals. Where will
prices go? Depends on the weather. If it is warm in Houston and New York City
over the Thanksgiving holidays, will prices continue to head south? Under
those conditions, they have since 1993. Call it ?Rader?s Stupid Frozen Turkey
Theory? or call it storage fundamentals, but be prepared in case this silly
theory comes true one more year. For an in-depth, wellhead to burnertip study

Oxy and EOG Swap Properties

    Occidental Petroleum and EOG Resources have exchanged oil and natural gas
fields to cut costs and boost production. Oxy received fields in California
that produce about 12 MMcf per day and mineral rights to more than 700,000
acres of land in the state. It also received properties in the western Gulf
that produce 26 MMcfe per day, adjacent to fields Oxy already owns. EOG
received properties in eastern Texas that are next to fields it owns and
which produce 33 MMcf per day and 3,000 barrels of oil a day. It also
acquired exploration rights on 312,000 acres in the Oklahoma panhandle.

Calpine Buys Reserves from Vintage

     Calpine has acquired 90 Bcf of natural gas reserves from Vintage
Petroleum for $71.5 million, becoming the largest gas producer in
California?s Sacramento Valley. Calpine bought the remaining 58% interest in
the Rio Vista field that it did not already own, along with some exploration
rights. It received the 42%  stake when it acquired Sheridan Energy last
November for $128 million. Calpine plans to purchasing natural gas fields and
pipelines so it can provide fuel for its natural gas powered generators at
lower costs. Calpine plans to expand its electric generation businesses in
California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada along with the Southeast and Northeast.
It operates power plants that can generate 3,400 MW.

Callon Natural Gas Blowout

    Callon Petroleum had a natural gas blowout while drilling a test well in
the Gulf of Mexico and a fire is burning from a portion of the well. There
were no injuries at the  at South Marsh Island Block 261 well, about 60 miles
south of Lafayette, Louisiana. The fire is burning from a portion of the well
casing about 20 feet above sea level. Wild Well Control, a well-blowout
specialty company, is making preparations to bring the well under control.

I think the example of when quantities may be subject to transportation and 
fuel is when an Operator overpulls at a delivery point and then cashes out 
the imbalance, TW could be out the transport and fuel.  For example,  

  DP is SoCal/Needles: scheduled volume is 700,000/d
     actual volume delivered is 720,000/d
     imbalance is 20,000/d, SoCal owes TW
     TW collects transport & fuel on 700,000/d (bill on scheduled volume)
     SoCal cuts a check to TW for dollar value of 20,000/d
     TW doesn't collect transport & fuel on 20,000/d
  Payback in-kind doesn't have this problem:
     The 20,000/d transport gets scheduled at Needles, TW collects the 
transport & fuel      (bill on scheduled volume), but we physically give 
SoCal 20,000/d less on that day

Is this the correct example?  I'm copying Lynn Blair to verify.

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

to me through Steve Harris and I'll get a copy for Stan.)

Are we still considering adding ETS-owned generation at one or more of the TW 
compressor stations in Arizona or NM?  In case that is still a possibility, 
let me pass on something we may want to follow up on.  I called an old law 
partner of mine from DC who is now in the generation development business 
this week to have lunch and catch up.  This guy says he has come up with a 
good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap.  He's got an 
80mw nameplate simple cycle project (two frame 6 turbines) under development 
in Utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in 
service on July 1.  Pretty quick work compared to other projects I've seen.  
Here's his racket:

1.  He gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained.  His 
Utah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from 
Tokyo Electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in 
typical electric utility gold plated style).  He didn't say, but I suspect 
there is no warranty on the units.  Obviously, this isn't a bold new 
strategy, but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used 
equipment.

2.  His siting/permitting strategy is to use "brownfield" sites--i.e., 
existing industrial or utility infrastructure is there along with some 
existing air emissions sources.  His Utah site is at the Magnesium Corp. of 
America plant on the Great Salt Lake. Magcorp is an ex-client of mine and I 
know it is a huge emissions source and has no Nimby issues.  Our compressor 
sites, in contrast, are not major emissions sites but may have some other 
things in common with this strategy.

3.  Here's a mysterious one--he says the financing is backstopped by the site 
owner (Magcorp in his project, potentially us if we do a TW project) but the 
corporate structure he has designed results in the power plant being treated 
as a non-controlled, non-affiliated entity for air permitting purposes.  That 
means the power plant emissions are not treated as part of the same emissions 
source as the host/site.  I'm not sure how/whether this works in a TW 
scenario, but it might be worth looking at.  We'd need to make sure that any 
power plant deal we chase doesn't screw up the timetable on the RedRock 
expansion application at FERC.  MKM--if we could preserve the "separate 
source" concept for air permitting purposes, could we even start work on 
developing a power project soon or would we be better off to wait until we 
have a FERC certificate in hand??       
    
Let me know if there is anything worth pursuing on this.  I'm having lunch 
with this guy on Mon. and will probably learn more.  The thing he is proudest 
of is that given the low permitting cost and relatively cheap cost of 
installed capacity, the project is expected to pay for itself in TWO MONTHS 
and then generate 100% upside.  Sounds good to me if its real.  DF

Dear General Counsels:

I have mentioned to you that we included Dow Jones and Public Records to the 
exisiting Westlaw contract ( flat rate remains the same, but more databases 
access) in August.    It took Westlaw Accounting long time to correct Aug. 
and Sept. invoices to reflect the changes.  I apologize for the delay on this 
reporting.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions on the 
reports.

Drew, Will you be moving to Houston soon?  I guess that when you do relocate

I have cc: Melinda Winn on this e:mail because she is handling legal matters

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout
and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy
monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While eternal
flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
like the way they do business."  A spokesperson for Enron said the two
cultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  According
to the company, "The deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  With
Hades' ability to attract and retain new customers, we see this as a
fabulous
growth opportunity for millennia to come."  According to several energy
industry insiders, Hades' high heating demand with very little need for
summer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.
Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide
and approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.  Enron is one of the
world's leading energy and communications companies.  The company owns
approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron
ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to Work For
if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A Week," and
is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by customers
with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts.

I thought that was the point of requesting a December 1 date -- so that the 
Commission had a longer period to act.  Since we requested an effective date 
with more than 30 days advance notice (but less than 60 days per 154.207 of 
the regs), then the Commission has until the effective date to act? ( NGA 
717c.)

At this mornings staff meeting, Stan asked about the status of TW options

agenda.  The 30 days to act is up on Nov. 16th, if the FERC hasn't done 
anything aren't the tariff sheets approved as filed?? If that answer is yes,  
isn't an order after that date required to meet the SS 5 requirements??   
Just thinking about the timing-  MK

Thanks Joe.  I'm asking Maria Pavlou to take a look at this and give you (and 
I) a preliminary answer.  I don't see any obvious problems--and the liability 
waiver is a good idea.  Maria--please take a look.  This will raise some of 
the same non jurisdictional revenue issues as the Clifton Machine Shop deal, 
unless we set it up on a strictly barter basis (i.e., no money changes 
hands--you give me 20 hours of training and I'll give you 20 hours of 
training).    DF

Subject: Technical Training

Drew . . . The GPG Training Department is wanting to share training classes 
with Reliant Energy and other companies.  This would involve GPG employees 
attending classes on other company facilities and other company employees 
attending classes on GPG facilities.  The concept will reduce training cost, 
reduce travel expenses, and increase the number of course offerings to GPG 
employees.

Any liabilities associated with training cooperatively with other companies?  
Perhaps a simple disclaimer form that each company signs.

Subject: Transwestern Contracts

You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but 
there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we 
left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection 
is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement 
signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later.  
Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk 
and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On 
my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate 
Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement.  

Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective 
files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done 
with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF

This will confirm our understanding that provided you clear any potential 
counterparty with the ETS Credit Department, it will not be necessary to get 
clearance for such counterparty from the Legal Department. As we discussed 
today, we will appreciate your continuing to include Legal on the notices of 
new potential counterparties.

Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the 
Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm 
having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on 
Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised 
draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, 
are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted 
confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in 
expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to 
recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. 
treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF

Will California's Restructuring Tremors Be Felt in Your Region?
,Copyright 2000 EEI.  All rights reserved.

EEI's State Restructuring Service is proud to present an Internet E-Forum to 
investigate whether the problems of California could occur in other parts of 
the country.

The California "restructuring earthquake" is marked by the doubling of some 
electric bills, multi-billion dollar utility under collections, electric 
reserve margin problems, and consumer outrage.  While these problems are the 
result of numerous factors, some may be replicated in other parts of the 
country.  This E-Forum will look at six regions of the county to see if the 
same "tremors" will be felt in those regions and if not, why not.  Our 
speakers will address the following questions:

Will your region see price spikes next summer?

What reliability challenges might your region experience next year?

Do any changes in state or federal laws or regulations need to be made?

How will retail markets be impacted by other factors such as, market 
structure, dependence on a spot market, high gas prices, and environmental 
restrictions?

To address these questions we have:

California  - Dr. John Jurewitz, Dir, Regulatory Policy, SoCal Edison
ERCOT  - Mike McCall, VP, Regulatory Affairs, TXU
PJM  - David Pratzon, Consultant, Exelon Power Team
Mid -West  - Corun Gagatsis, Sr Regulatory Strategist, Detroit Edison
New England  - Gary Simon, Sr VP, Enterprise, Development and Analysis, NU
New York  - William L. Jaeger, Chief Eng., Transmission Planning, ConEd

Our guest moderator is Chuck Gray, Exec. Dir., National Association of 
Regulatory Utility Commissioners

To provide questions and commentary we have Dr. John H. Landon, Principal, 
Dir. Energy Practice Analysis Group/Economics

November 17, 2000 1 p.m. ET
Note:  Please block a 2-hour time slot for the E-Forum.  We expect the 
program to take at least one hour.  Q&A at the conclusion of the E-Forum 
could take up to an additional hour.

Registration Cut-off and Cancellation Policy: All registrations must be 
received by November 15, 2000.  Substitutions may be made at any time,

Subject: Re: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC. Project  

As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially 
provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the 
mainline in Arizona.  Although, the final negotiation are not complete 
certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting 
the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this 
project.  

The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and 
approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may 
be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice 
provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the 
blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental).

With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions:

Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an 
incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project.

Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for 
approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of 
Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as 
transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's 
regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply 
for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any 
interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore, 
would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the 
proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?

Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate 
filing or is a case-specific certificate required?

As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season 
required for the project?  My opinion is "NO".  Do you agree?

Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks MW

Per my conversation with Lynn and Steve on Friday night, we have claimed 
force majeure for any gas shut ins that actually happened for the 1st.  (I'm 
not sure how extensive that actually turned out to be).   Does that have any 
financial consequences or other consequences for us?  For example, on TW, 
certain force majeure situations can force us to refund demand charges, 
right?  NN's tariff doesn't have a similar mechanism, but we may have common 
law exposure.  We may need to revisit the Jan 1-4 period when we talk 
tomorrow or Wed.  This would really make Continental and possibly others mad, 
but at worst, we could put out a revised notice saying that the shut-ins for 
the 1st -4th were not FM.  Any thoughts?  DF

Force Majeur.  They (Melissa Master) did not seem to be too surprised.  She

if we go back down on the 4th or 5th we will not mark any of the compressor 
with Force Majeure.

Subject: FM

Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue--i.e., are we cutting off 
shippers' supply due to force majeure?  

1.    If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly 
no.  We're shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the 
tariff quality spec., not due to force majeure.  We have the discretion to 
grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent 
operators and so long as we don't discriminate.   If that gas is out of spec 
on any of the specific items listed in the "Quality" section of the tariff 
(Sec. 44?  47?  I can't remember which but its one of those) then the answer 
is the same.  

2.  If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the 
answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons 
falling out as liquids.  I'm remembering the catch all section of the Quality 
paragraph as prohibiting "dirt, gums, and other impurities that would 
interfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah" or something to that 
effect.  That catch all seems to me to include liquids.  IF the c6 and 
heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people 
delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no 
force majeure.   I read Eric's very scientific email and I think the punch 
line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?   The 
thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. 
limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers 
are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't 
work as good.  

3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we 
could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an 
event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.

I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF

Excellent reading of the legal authority issues as well as the political 
winds.  I think your sense of the likelihood of trouble is accurate.  I also 
agree with your implicit premise that if FERC or anyone else wanted to make 
trouble regarding our negotiated rate deals, the easiest approach, and the 
most direct one, is to challenge the deals as unjust and unreasonable under 
NGA section 4/5.  To challenge the deals under some state law "gouging" 
theory would give rise to preemption defenses on our part, etc.  I'll talk to 
you and Kathy further tomorrow AM and then we can grab Mike to discuss.  
Thanks.  DF

Subject: Re: gouging  

As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
"fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF

Subject: Re: gouging  

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

David Port, ETS is purchasing a trading system from Caminus to track their 
transactions.  Included in this system are position reports which the 
Accounting Department will be using to report and determine compliance with 
the attached policy and procedures, including open positions, VAR, MTM, 
approval limits, Greeks, credit risk, stress testing, basis positions, 
confirmations and invoicing.  The ETS Risk Management policy requires that 
our reporting conform to the corporate standards, accordingly your name was 
given to me as the person who could help direct some of the more technical 
reporting standards.

Caminus is doing an introduction to their system today from 12:00 am to 3 pm 
in 49c2, however I know you will not be back in town until next week.  Vernon 
Mercaldo is coordinating the installation of the system and will be needing 
your input relating to Corporate reporting standards.  As the project 
progresses he will be contacting you.

Attached are drafts of the ETS Policy and Procedures.

We do not have a "policy" regarding the ergonomic chairs.  From my 
experience, management can approve this request if it is reasonable 
(generally, if the person making the request is confined to long hours in an 
office chair which could potentially cause or worsen back problems) and if 
they have money in the budget as the cost would be borne by the department.  
I understand that Pat Scarsborrow (sp?) at 3-5368 is the person in Property 
in Houston to contact for these chairs.  I also found out that any time new 
furniture is ordered, that these chairs are now standard issue.  Our Safety 
person indicated that OSHA is coming out with new rules this year which may 
require that companies provide this benefit to employees, so you may as well 
get ahead of the game.  I'm told that it generally takes 2-3 months after the 
order is placed before the chairs arrive.

Please let me know if you have any other questions in this regad.

Susan Scott would like authorization to order an Aeron chair for each of her

problems, which she has.  Many people at Enron already have this type of 
chair, but we rarely, if ever, have a surplus because they are so popular.  
The cost is $567.77 per chair plus tax.  Please approve the purchase of two.  
Thanks!

Here are the stray facts I mentioned:
  Sulfur River system:  1200 miles of gathering in East Texas and some 
treating/processing
  approx. 170 mmcf/d of throughput currently; significant growth expected 
from new drilling [?]
   EBITDA:  $40mm/yr
   Rex Kouri (sp?) is the founding equity in Sulfur River  (I haven't heard 
of him, but they acted like I should have) 
   An outfit named "Energy Spectrum" put $30 mm in equity into Sulfur River a 
few years ago and thinks now would be a good time to cash out
   $90 mm in debt
   $1/mmbtu gath/proc. margins
  The guys I talked to said the Sulfur River assets, coupled with the Koch 
upstream assets in the area, would make an interesting combined play.
   Koch was asking $200 mil. for their gathering assets a year ago or so--I 
don't know if its the exact set of assets that Pat and Jerry were suggesting 
we'd want to include in the package.

The two guys involved are Pat Keeley, of Friedman Billings and Ramsay in DC 
and Jerry Langdon (the ex-FERC Commissioner), who is an investor/dealmaker.  
Let me know if you want me to get these guys to come in and pitch this deal 
to you/your team.  Reminder--Langdon is talking to Stan on the 10th on EOTT 
and he may bug Stan about this stuff, so it may be good to get to Stan 
first.  DF

Drew and Dot,
 It appears that one of our commercial/regulatory lawyers signed off on a 
right-of-way agreement that they simply should not have, and in my opinion is 
outside their area of expertise and practice.  I am going to follow up with 
the individual on this and it also appears that they were at least in part, a 
victim of a calculated "snow-job" by our brethern over at Enron Northern 
America as well as a misunderstanding of the marketing affilate rule.  Along 
these lines, I am concerned that some of our folks in an effort to be 
responsive to our clients may feel that they have to provide advice in areas 
where they should be seeking the advice of those who practice in that area on 
a routine basis.  I think it would be helpful for the three of us to 
establish guidelines for our folks on when we would expect them to seek 
guidance from others who practice in certain primary areas of 
responsibility.  For example, if an environmental question comes up, I would 
expect any lawyer in our group to talk to Mr. Reich or myself.  If an issue 
arose with respect to Northern's tariff, one would expect that the lawyer 
would speak to Maria, Drew or Dari.  

 Let me know what you think and we will go from there.

Lou

Outlook for Midwest ISO Brought into Question

Standard & Poor's (S&P) revised the outlook to negative from stable on
the Midwest Independent Transmission System (Midwest ISO). S&P also confirm=
ed
its triple 'B'-plus issues credit on the Midwest ISO, the non-profit=20
independent
corporation that will manage the operations of a portion of the transmissio=
n
assets of utilities across a 12-state region.

ANALYSIS: This is the latest in a string of developments that has put into
question the future of the Midwest ISO, as the organization continues to
sort through the recent announcements of two key members that have decided
to depart. The Midwest ISO was organized to ensure that energy suppliers
are protected against price instability and discriminatory access to the
transmission grid, among other potential problems associated with grid
management.

For those unaware of the terminology, let me offer a brief explanation.
Under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC's) Order 2000, utiliti=
es
that own, control or operate transmission assets were essentially mandated
to join a regional transmission organization (RTO), an umbrella term that
can include a not-for-profit ISO (independent system operator), for-profit
transmission company (transco) or a hybrid of both models.

Although roundly considered the favorite ISO model by FERC, the foundation
of the Midwest ISO began to shake a bit when two founding members announced
they were departing to join a competing RTO. Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)
announced just last week that it would be leaving the organization and
joining the rival Alliance RTO, a move it expects to complete by Dec. 15,
2001. ComEd's announcement followed a similar decision last September by
Illinois Power, also a founding member, to depart and join the Alliance
RTO. The Midwest ISO is a not-for-profit model, while the Alliance is a
transco model.

Although both utilities cited unique reasons for their departure, their
move to the Alliance RTO does support a clear preference for the transco
model of transmission management, over the ISO model. ComEd contends that
since the completion of its merger with PECO Energy=01*forming the new comp=
any
Exelon=01*it has a significant amount of transmission assets in the=20
Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region, and the Alliance RTO offers a "better fit"
for the combined PECO / Unicom transmission assets. Specifically, ComEd
argued that the bulk of its customers and suppliers are in the eastern
half of the United States, where the Alliance RTO is more prominent. The
Midwest ISO, on the other hand, has established its presence to the north
and west of ComEd's service territory. From a legal standpoint, ComEd claim=
s
that it can break its ties with the Midwest ISO because, under a charter
agreement, it is allowed to depart since its transmission facilities change=
d
ownership through the merger. Thinking it might be able to avoid litigation=
,
ComEd has promised to meet any financial obligations to the Midwest ISO
before it officially departs for the Alliance RTO.

Illinois Power, one of the original nine participants in the Midwest ISO
dating back to January 1998, was the first utility to make its exit from
the Midwest ISO. Illinois Power, like ComEd, claimed that its acquisition
by Dynegy constituted a change in ownership, freeing itself from the ISO
agreement, and that a move to the Alliance RTO would be more appropriate.


However, as I've inferred, I believe both utilities have made their attempt=
ed
moves because of a desire to operate under a for-profit transco model.
The impetus for both of their departures probably had less to do with their
respective mergers and more to do with the fact that previous talks to
form a transco, operating separately under the Midwest ISO, fizzled last
summer. Perhaps concluding that the ISO model would be restrictive, Illinoi=
s
Power has stated that its reasons for the change-in-heart came about becaus=
e
of greater flexibility and cost savings that would be realized by being
a member of the Alliance RTO. These benefits would originate from the RTO's
experience in deregulated markets (many members of the Alliance RTO operate
in deregulated states as opposed to the members of the Midwest ISO). The
Alliance RTO also eliminates pancaked rates and provides price certainty
through its "postage stamp" rate for transactions providing power outside
of, or through, the Alliance and its "license plate" rate for all transacti=
ons
that deliver power within the Alliance.

Although ComEd and Illinois Power have announced their departures, it's
important to note that the Midwest ISO is not going to let them leave witho=
ut
a fight. Realizing that losing the transmission assets of both utilities
severely diminishes the bulk of its organization, the Midwest ISO has=20
submitted
a motion with FERC to block the utilities' exit. ComEd, for instance,=20
contributes
about 26 percent of the load that was originally scheduled to flow through
the Midwest ISO. Thus, the Midwest ISO is arguing that creating a broad
RTO, based on widely dispersed transmission assets, is in the best interest
of all of its members. In addition, the Midwest ISO contends that allowing
utilities to easily switch from one RTO to another would compromise=20
reliability
across interconnected transmission grids.

Ironically, the departure of ComEd and Illinois Power, along with the FERC
investigation of the case, comes at a time when the Midwest ISO appeared
to be growing. Just last month, Kansas City-based UtiliCorp and Fergus
Falls, Minn.-based Otter Tail Power Co. announced that they were joining
the Midwest ISO. The addition of UtiliCorp was a major coup for the Midwest
ISO, as the energy company owns about 6,200 miles of electric transmission
lines. Wisconsin Public Service Resources and American Transmission recentl=
y
joined as transmission-owning members and Calpine Corp. joined as a=20
non-transmission
member. In addition, the Midwest ISO just announced that it is assuming
management responsibility for the operating functions of the Mid-American
Interconnected Network (MAIN), which provides electricity to about 19 milli=
on
people within key Midwest states overseen by the Midwest ISO. The partnersh=
ip
of the two organizations should help to facilitate a smooth transition
for the Midwest ISO to become operational on its target date next December.

In any event, it is clear that the S&P downgrading of the Midwest ISO is
a direct reaction to the likely departure of ComEd and Illinois Power,
something that FERC may not be able to prevent. Specifically, S&P is=20
acknowledging
that the departure of ComEd and Illinois Power will result in a "material
loss of some load subject to the Midwest ISO cost adder." What this means
is that the Midwest ISO's debt repayment obligations are based on a cost
adder that is applied to certain transmission loads. The cost adder is
capped at 15 cents/MWh during the transition period from the start of=20
operations
(fourth quarter 2001) until the fourth-quarter of 2007. As noted, ComEd
contributes about 26 percent of the load that is scheduled to flow through
the Midwest ISO. If ComEd and Illinois Power actually do leave the Midwest
ISO, this could result in a higher cost adder being placed on remaining
members. While the Midwest ISO's costs are fully recoverable under its
tariff with remaining members, raising its cost adder could have a negative
impact on the low-cost economic incentives that the Midwest ISO has used
to attract new members.

Moreover, the future prospects for the Midwest ISO remain questionable.
If ComEd and Illinois Power are allowed to leave, it could spark a mass
exodus of other members, which obviously would shrink the organization
and cast in doubt its status among other RTOs. Moving forward during this
period of upheaval, the central challenge for the Midwest ISO is to identif=
y
the benefits of joining its not-for-profit model when so many utilities
clearly prefer the for-profit transco model.

Note:  The FERC meeting is today.  See the link below that can be checked for 
updates.

Enron's Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes

As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning 
with the federal government's answer to California's be-deviled power market, 
free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price 
cap route espoused by the Cal-ISO. FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9 
AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates) 

In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker yesterday, Enron CEO 
Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural 
problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers 
who have placed "price cap 'band aids' over hemorrhaging wounds." 

Lay told Hoecker the power market is "halfway across a busy street in its 
transition from monopoly to competition. It can't stand where it is." He said 
FERC has to make a choice between falling into the "same trap of political 
expediency as California's ISO, leaving the nation's electric system in the 
lurch from one crisis to the next, [o]r it can take a big step toward 
fundamental structural reform." 

At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) called on FERC 
to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the Cal-ISO from 
"unilaterally implementing" any changes to its current $250/MWh price cap for 
wholesale electricity purchases. In a motion filed Monday, the marketer group 
specifically asked the Commission to bar the Cal-ISO board of directors from 
putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex 
load-differentiated price cap of $100 or less during the off-peak season 
effective Nov. 3. The plan was designed by the state's main utility consumer 
group (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). In addition, the EPSA urged FERC to "state 
explicitly" that the Cal-ISO does not have the authority to impose or extend 
price or bid caps, unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission. 
The Cal-ISO's current authority to set price caps expires on Nov. 15. 

Lay said the Cal-ISO's complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of 
gas-fired generation, "making obvious errors such as failing to take into 
account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in 
California; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to 
sell their gas supply, rather than use it to make electricity in California." 
The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc 
basis "to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract 
sufficient supplies (which it inevitably will do)," Lay said. In addition, 
the capped formula "invites generators to shut in production, export power 
out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries." 

He noted that the ISO's Chairman voted against the measure while all of the 
state's utilities voted for it "presumably knowing full well that it simply 
will not work." 

California is "just the latest failure of partial or compromised open 
access," said Lay. "It's time for the Commission to reject this approach. 

"The power industry --- the nation's most essential industry --- is mired in 
the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice. 
Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one 
vested interest or another. As a result, utilities are free to slow the 
interconnection of new generation, withhold equal access to the transmission 
system, favor their own sales over those of competitors, miscalculated 
available transmission capacity, and exercise control over supposedly 
'independent' system operators and reliability organizations. 

Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would 
"plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and 
conservation methods..." 

FERC has to complete the work that it started, said Lay. It has to ensure 
that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by "ending the 
special priority for utility uses of the system. Second, FERC must require 
transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets 
from their other businesses. Third, FERC must take politics out of 
transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure 
independence. Finally, FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps 
by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate 
efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies." 

EPSA said the Cal-ISO board "acted in obvious disregard for the Commission's 
orderly processes." It "cannot be permitted to make the Commission's 
decisions for it, or to alter so radically market rules, thereby injecting 
more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for 
fashioning fair, effective and comprehensive remedies" for California's 
"flawed" electric markets, the group noted. 

The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the 
California markets will be "severely compromised" if the Cal-ISO board's 
imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect.

Toronto Hydro, Ontario Power Generation Launch EBT Express
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

Toronto Hydro Corporation and Ontario Power Generation announced that they
have launched an electronic business transaction (EBT) "hub" that will
provide centralized electronic data management and transaction services
to local distribution companies (LDCs) and energy retailers in Ontario.
Called EBT Express, the exchange will become operational when Ontario's
new competitive electricity market opens next spring. Excelergy eXACT=01v,
developed by energy software solutions company Excelergy Corporation, will
provide the technology infrastructure for EBT Express.

ANALYSIS: This is a significant development, as EBT Express represents
the first hub in Canada for retail energy transactions. The site will serve
as the central clearinghouse for immediate communication of customer data
among hundreds of LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario, and possibly=20
throughout
Canada.  I spoke yesterday afternoon with George Caraghiaur, Exelergy's
vice president, Canada, about EBT Express. Caraghiaur believes that the
site "will provide the essential technology for opening Ontario's electrici=
ty
market in an efficient manner." That is no small undertaking as there are
an expected 300 players that will need to communicate with each other in
Ontario once competition begins.

Deregulation is happening in Canada on a province-by-province basis (much
like it is happening state-by-state in the U.S.). Thus far, only Ontario
and Alberta have set dates when electric customers will be able to select
a new energy supplier. Ontario is scheduled to become competitive next
spring, and presently is the only region in which EBT Express will be=20
operational.
Alberta uses a point-to-point transaction process, which represents a very
complex model. Caraghiaur believes that the value of EBT Express will be
clearly seen, and there will be many opportunities for the hub in Alberta
and elsewhere.

The Ontario Energy Board (OEB), which is the equivalent of a state PUC,
mandated the use of electronic business transactions (EBTs). The EBTs work
as follows: Once a customer selects a new energy supplier, the energy suppl=
ier
and the local distribution company (LDC) must continue to share information
about that customer. This proprietary data, shared strictly on a one-to-one
basis between the energy supplier and the LDC only, will include billing,
usage and payment information. Essentially, an LDC will read the meter
and send usage information to the energy supplier, who will calculate its
portion of a customer's bill and in turn send this data back to the LDC,
which will submit the customer bill. This represents a common way for billi=
ng
in Ontario, although there are other options including consolidated billing
that originates from the energy supplier and split billing coming from
both the LDC and energy supplier. No customer information will be exchanged
until competition officially begins in Ontario, which now appears to be
in the spring of 2001, although the technology infrastructure supplied
by Excelergy is already in place.

In response to the OEB's mandate, Toronto Hydro Corp. and Ontario Power
Generation=01*the largest players in electricity distribution and generatio=
n
in Ontario=01* became equity partners in the $7.7 million joint venture to
create EBT Express. All customer data will be contained within EBT Express,
which is supported by the eXACT technology. Excelergy eXACT is a software
solution that translates, validates, manages and delivers data exchanged
among users. The functionality of eXACT has been used in several U.S. state=
s,
including Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In fact, eXACT was introduced to
gas and electricity retailers in the United States in 1999 as a component
of Excelergy ABP=01v, a billing and customer information solution. Alleghen=
y
Energy Supply, a subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, was one U.S. utility that
I know of that used the Excelergy technology.

Caraghiaur contends that EBT Express will play an important role in enhanci=
ng
the competitive market in Ontario. "There are presently 37 licensed retaile=
rs
in Ontario, 15 pending retailers and 246 LDCs," Caraghiaur told me. "You
can imagine the cloud of communication pathways that would occur between
all these players without a centralized hub such as EBT Express." The numbe=
r
of LDCs seemed awfully high to me, but Caraghiaur explained that in Ontario
many LDCs serve only a small number of customers, often 100 customers or
less. This should change as consolidation reduces the number of LDCs in
Ontario but, when compared to the United States, Ontario still will have
a comparatively high number of distribution companies.

Caraghiaur cited Pennsylvania as an example of a market that has tried
to assimilate communication among many market participants. Pennsylvania,
along with most other U.S. states, still uses electronic data interchange
(EDI) as its standard, wherein every LDC has a slightly different=20
interpretation
of data that is shared through the EDI. This can often cause communication
inconsistencies and retailers may have a difficult time in getting ready
for deregulation. "EBT Express will be in the position to enforce standards=
,"
says Caraghiaur. "The use of XML in particular will enhance communication
between market participants."

In fact, XML (extensible market language) is the cornerstone of eXACT as
it constructs a standardized language so that data can be exchanged but
still understood by different applications. Caraghiaur claims that Excelerg=
y
is on the forefront of XML technology, which was expressly stipulated in
the EBT standards developed by the Advisory Committee to the Ontario Energy
Board. XML is a common language used on the Internet that makes it easier
and more cost-effective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between
applications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible.
In addition, Excelergy's eXACT software is object-oriented, allowing for
easy and rapid change from one program to another.

Clearinghouse exchanges are definitely a trend in the energy industry.
Whereas states that previously deregulated, such as California and=20
Pennsylvania,
did not use a centralized clearinghouse for customer information, states
and provinces now formulating their restructuring plans often mandate them.
For instance, Excelergy's competitor Logica has a market data clearinghouse
built for the Midwest market. Also, the ERCOT-ISO has teamed with Andersen
Consulting on a similar market data clearinghouse for the Texas unbundling,
scheduled for pilot in the summer of 2001 and full market opening in Januar=
y
2002.

One concern that market participants may have is the sharing of customer
data through EBT Express, especially when it is backed by potential=20
competitors
in the Ontario market such as Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power. Caraghiaur
responded to this by saying that the OEB mandated the exchange of customer
information through an EBT structure. However, market participants are
not mandated to participate in EBT Express. They could opt to still exchang=
e
information on a point-to-point basis, although Caraghiaur believes that
EBT Express offers a much more efficient forum for the transfer of customer
data. In addition, Caraghiaur reiterated that no proprietary or competitive
information would be accessible between any parties other than the LDC
and energy supplier involved in the exchange.

Interestingly, Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power may be competitors when
the Ontario market opens next year. Toronto Hydro Corp. owns Toronto=20
Hydro-Electric
System Limited, a regulated electricity distribution system, and Toronto
Hydro Energy Services, a competitive energy service company. Ontario Power
Generation is an electricity generating company, so Toronto Hydro and Ontar=
io
Power will be competing on the retail level to acquire energy supply contra=
cts
with lucrative customers. And rumor has it that venerable retail giant
Sears is also taking a look into becoming an energy retailer in Canada
next year. As Canada continues to deregulate and attract energy suppliers,
Excelergy anticipates that the EBT Express could serve a national market.

As long as Dave and/or you are signing off on the EOL packages, I don't have 
any problem with this.  As to non-EOL deals, we may also want to eliminate 
the requirement that all Demarc deals need such a high approval level.  I 
don't think there is anything uniquely risky about Demarc as long as we have 
our capacity posting squared away.  DF

Drew,
        Placement of a demarc delivery package on EOL necessarily means it 
was approved.  An after the fact note from Linda will suffice.

Tenaska Marketing Ventures accepted a package on EOL yesterday that delivers 
to demarc.  Although EOL deals are pre-approved the CMS system is coded to 
route demarc deals to the president level.  In order to expedite the 
activation of this request and since it was a pre-approved EOL deal, I 
approved the route for each of you in CMS per a request from marketing.  

Please let me know if this process will not be agreeable on future EOL deals 
that include demarc.

Thanks

Linda

Please Note:

The Corporate Risk Management Department prepares ET&S's Value at Risk 
calculation.  They recently completed a review of our historical experience 
and correlation on our hedged positions.  Based on this review, we have 
agreed to increase the correlation to .90.  This change has caused the V@R to 
decrease significantly to more appropriately reflect the risk in our 
positions.  We will continue to work with Risk Management to assure that our 
exposures are being appropriately reflected in the V@R calculation.

If there are any question regarding the V@R calculation, please contact Dan 
Fancler or Bob Chandler.

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

With the many organizational changes that have taken place recently, we have 
decided to cancel the P&D Facilitator training that was scheduled for Monday, 
11/13/00.  It is not likely that such training will take place before next 
year and we will keep you up to date as those plans are finalized.

As winter approaches and the possibility of inclement weather, I want to 
remind you of the process we have in place to notify you if the office will 
be closed or have a delayed start.

You are encouraged to call 398-7000, 398-7200 or 398-7700 for an announcement 
regarding the closing of the office.  Every attempt will be made to have this 
announcement in place no later than 6:30 AM.  

We will also attempt to contact the following radio stations:

  KFAB   1110 AM
  KKAR  1290 AM
  KQKQ             98 FM

to have them broadcast an announcement.  As you are probably aware, we have 
experienced difficulty reaching the radio stations in the past so please call 
one of the numbers listed above if you don't hear an announcement on the 
radio.

Back by popular demand, here are the current travel alternatives to Shadow 
Ridge C.C., the site of this year's NPNG Holiday Party:


Pacific Street  

There are currently no road projects that would block access to the club's 
main enterance at 187th - this is the recommended route.
    
The work that had Pacific out of commission from 190th to 204th has been 
completed.  However, the intersection at 204th is still somewhat a mess - no 
street lights, no traffic lights, unmarked roads, no street signs, etc.  
Also, Pacific is now closed west of 204th.

Center Street  

Center Street is open.  However, you currently cannot directly access 180th 
Street (North or South) from Center or cross Center on 180th.  

There is an unmarked detour that can get you to from Center to 180th around 
the Lakeside Complex and through the Western Springs subdivision.  But it 
would be difficult to explain on paper how to do it.

You can turn on to 192nd from Center (the Lanoha corner), go North on 192nd 
to Pacific and go East to 187th to get to the club.  But be careful if you 
take this route to go from the club back to Center - turning from 192nd on to 
Center going East can be a problem at times (cars on Center do travel at 
fairly high speeds and they do not expect people to be coming on to Center at 
this location at this time of night).  Watch out for wildlife in this area as 
well.
    
West Dodge Road

Dodge is a mess from 160th to 180th Street.  There are some lane changes in 
this area that can be hard to navigate when it is dark.  Also, there is no 
way to gain access to 168th from Dodge or cross Dodge at 168th.

If you feel up to handling the construction, you can get off of Dodge at 
180th Street.  But be sure to recognize that 180th is an abnormal 
intersection - it is like an interchange without an overpass (going west, 
you'll need to take an unmarked exit lane that goes off to the right at about 
179th, turn on to 180th, and cross Dodge at  the intersection - left turns 
directly off of Dodge are not permitted).

Also, be aware that there is an unmarked deer crossing area that goes from 
about 180th to 186th Street on Dodge and a few blocks South of Dodge at 180th 
- there is a creek that serves as crossing point for such wildlife.  I have 
seen a number of cars that have hit deer in this area.


Bottom line, taking Pacific is the best route.

Subject: Re: New Marketing Company  


Steve,

Yes, Dan did ask my opinion on the feasibility of forming a new affiliate 
company (NEWCO).  I know he asked many others as well.  Here is what I told 
him:

There is no regulatory prohibition on NEWCO holding capacity on our pipelines.
NEWCO will have to be set up to meet the creditworthiness standards or else 
we raise the risk of having to lower the creditworthiness test for others.
Under the current rules, even though NEWCO will hold capacity, NEWCO will not 
be a Marketing Affiliate (i.e. requiring separate staff/systems) etc. so long 
as they are not buying or selling gas.  On the flip side, if the new 
affiliate sells gas Including delivered gas), the entity will be a Marketing 
Affiliate and we would have to set if up so all the separation rules are 
met.  I anticipate that FERC's marketing affiliate rules may change in 2001 
such that any energy affiliate, including capacity managers, will be subject 
to the marketing affiliate standards of conduct.  If the success of NEWCO 
depends on sharing unposted information, this strategy is not likely to last 
very long.
Most significantly, when the new affiliate wants to resell/trade its capacity 
rights, it will have to do so through the pipeline's capacity release rules.  
The new affiliate can arrange pre-arranged transactions of less than 30 days, 
but any other deals would have to be posted for bid.   But, I don't think we 
should be scared off just because the deals would have to go through capacity 
release.  NEWCO could do less than 30 day releases at above max. rates on a 
prearranged basis.  NEWCO could also do 1 year of less prearranged deals at 
above max rate,  they would just have to be posted to see if anyone wanted to 
match the deal.


The crux is that there is no regulatory prohibition standing in the way of 
setting up a new affiliate, but it is important to figure out what the new 
affiliate's objective is.  
If the point is to capture short-term, above max rate deals without going 
through a negotiated rate posting, then we may follow a fairly simple 
strategy of setting up a limited NEWCO to buy and sell capacity only.  
If the point is to "churn" capacity trading, then the issues are essentially 
the same as those involved in setting up bid/ask trading on EOL.  
If the point is longer-term, total energy type of deals, then we just need to 
understand that the new affiliate will be a marketing affiliate.

You ask what is being done to further this idea.   I think we need some 
clearer marketing vision of how NEWCO plans to make money (through above max 
rate deals in capacity release?  through rebundled deal? ) before  a more 
definitive list of regulatory steps can be developed.

Shelley,
 I know Danny talked to you a while back about us creating a new company to 
hold capacity on other pipes, etc. What ever happened to that idea? I would 
really like to pursue that avenue as I believe we may be missing out on some 
things we could do. Please let me know the status. Thanks.

FERC contacted INGAA to ask that pipelines call Dan Larcamp in the event that 
they experience any curtailments, supply shortages or other critical

have some time to react before they are asked to respond in a public forum

Well, I'm not sure how responsive Dot's response was to your initial 
communication, but I agree that there is a 10 year retention policy on 
contracts and agreements and their backup.  This to me would only apply to 
all of the gas purchase contracts we pulled from storage, most of which are 
probably close to the end of the 10 years.  Litigation workpapers, which to 
me would include all of the pleadings, correspondence, discovery, exhibits, 
depositions, etc., have a six year retention.  The other documents we pulled 
from storage but didn't produce, such as Mike McGowan's and Mary Kay's old 
files on take-or-pay issues, FERC orders, etc., would have different 
retention policies depending upon their content.

2 questions :

- I assume if we produced an old 3-year plan, even though it should have been 
destroyed long ago, it would now fall under the 6 year litigation workpaper 
retention policy? 

-Do you think documents from the first trial have to "start over" and be kept 
for another 6 years?

I just talked to Cynthia Sandherr about this and she was partly up to speed.  
They have been fighting with the CFTC to keep it from extending its 
jurisdiction to Enron Online and to all the financial products Enron sells.   
We apparently have a bill pending to lock the CFTC in and keep it from going 
after energy-related financial products.  Cynthia was not aware of any 
potential collaboration between CFTC and FERC designed to push FERC into the 
role of regulator of these markets (with CFTC pulling the strings behind the 
scenes).  Cynthia was cranky about this possibility and will follow up.

He's not a nazi, he's a commie.  Actually he's a democrat but such subtle 
distinctions escape me.  What MKM is talking about is a conversation I had in 
DC with a buddy of mine who is a commissioner on the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission.  He said there is a move afoot to expand regulation of 
financial products like weather hedges, spark spread swaps and similar 
industry specific instruments that his agency has not regulated in the past.  
(they just regulate the commodity exchanges like the NYMEX, Chicago Board of 
Trade, etc.)  He also made it sound like Enron Online had made his staff 
people more nervous about the lack of regulation over those kinds of 
products.  The current strategy, he explained, was to solve the problem of 
the CFTC's arguable lack of jurisdiction over such products by getting the 
agencies with jurisdiction over the industry to which such products were 
being sold (i.e., the FERC as to energy products) to regulate the stuff based 
on the CFTC's guidance.  I assume that Kean's group is on top of this, but I 
haven't had the chance to check yet.  I talked to a guy in the DC office 
about 6 months about CFTC issues and will follow up with him on Monday and be 
sure they are aware of this leftist plot.  I can't remember his name just 
now, but he works for Cynthia Sandherr, I think.  I'll let you know what is 
going on after I talk to those folks.  DF

Here's the deal--I just talked to my guy out in Kennebec S.D. and got a 
glowing report on the situation.  His opening day group is down to 6 guys so 
he is only giving them access to half of his fields--we get first shot at the 
rest.  He's got so many pheasants he's worried about us limiting out to fast 
and getting mad.    I assured him that the way we all shoot that wouldn't be 
a problem.  
When:  Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29.  
Where:  Kenebec S.D.  (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from 
Omaha)
$$:   $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.   If we dwindle to less 
than 8, its $100 per guy.  (he will cut us some slack on this if some of you 
can only hunt 2 days.)
Fish:  Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included
Lodging :  Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is 
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.  Super 8 is a 
lovely place:  motto is "Labs sleep free."  $100 per night, 4 guys per room+ 
$25/head/night.

So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have 
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.   I'd like to get 10 locked 
in solid by end of Sept.  More than that would make the hunting a little 
clumsy.  Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due around 
this time.  What a lame excuse!!  You were there for the first 4, right?  
Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?  If you guys have anyone else that's 
interested other than the folks that have already been invited, let me know 
as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have around 10.  
Talk to you.  DF

Steve Anderton called today and has cleared the arbitration with his firm's 
conflict committee.  He's sending an email tomorrow describing the specific 
results of his conflict check.  I'll forward it to you both for review.  From 
my discussions with Steve, I think he'd do a great job as our arbitrator.  
Are we all in agreement on using Steve or are there some other competing 
candidates?  Do you guys want to talk to him or meet with him first?  Britt, 
do we need a retention agreement with Steve if we decide to use him?   A 
self-serving retention agreement may be a good idea if we think OneOk might 
challenge our arbitrator based on alleged bias.  Also, if we are good to go 
with Steve, I'd like to send him a package of the key documents and then meet 
with him to discuss the case sometime in the next week or two.  Britt, any 
concerns with my doing that as long as I don't send him anything privileged?  
(I'm assuming for the sake of safety that the attorney client privilege 
doesn't apply to our communications with our arbitrator unless instructed 
otherwise).  He is down in Houston two days a week so we could do it there.

Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan, P.C. Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against 
Azurix Corp.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2000 5:27:00 PM EST 
PHILADELPHIA, Oct 26, 2000 AZX ("Azurix" or the "Company") at artificially 
inflated prices during the period June 9, 1999 through August 8, 2000 and 
traceable to Azurix's Initial Public Offering ("Class Period") and who were 
damaged thereby.

If you are a member of the proposed Class, you should contact this firm at 
the telephone number or address below. If you wish to be appointed lead 
plaintiff in this action you must file a motion with the Court no later 
December 12, 2000. Class members must meet certain legal requirements to 
serve as a lead plaintiff. If you purchased Azurix common stock during the 
Class Period or have questions or information regarding this action or your 
rights, you may call or write Barbara A. Podell, Adam Savett or Renee C. 
Nixon, of Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan. P.C. at 800/993-3233 or via e-mail at 
sfprpc@op.net.

The complaint charges Azurix and certain of its senior officers and directors 
with violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 
("Securities Act") and Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint 
also charges Enron Corp. as a controlling person under Section 15 of the 
Securities Act and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges 
that during the Class Period, defendants disseminated to the investing public 
false and misleading financial statements and press releases concerning the 
Company's publicly reported financial condition and future prospects. The 
complaint further alleges that defendants issued to the public on or about 
June 9, 1999, in connection with the Company's initial public offering, a 
false and misleading registration statement and prospectus. These documents 
touted the Company's primary business strategy - acquiring, owning, operating 
and managing large privatization w
ater supply and wastewater projects. However, through a series of partial 
disclosures beginning on March 30, 2000 and ending on August 8, 2000, it was 
revealed that several large privatization projects were already postponed or 
canceled at or near the time of the IPO. As a result of defendants' 
misrepresentations the price of Azurix common stock was artificially inflated 
throughout the Class Period.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Azurix 
common stock during the Class Period. The plaintiff is represented by Savett 
Frutkin Podell & Ryan, P.C. which has extensive experience representing 
shareholders in class actions and has successfully recovered hundreds of 
millions of dollars for defrauded investors and shareholders. The reputation 
and expertise of the firm in shareholder and other class action litigation 
has been repeatedly recognized by the courts, which have appointed the firm 
to major positions in complex class action litigations.

25th

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will 
strive to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.


Thanks,

I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager for 
the Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and 
Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts 
team might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next 
week or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their 
outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the key--he 
is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my 
old firm in DC.  The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all 
through their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretations 
and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD.  Bill and Bill--does such a 
meeting sound productive?  If so, should we have outside govt. contracts 
counsel present and if so, who do you suggest?  

On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that 
he was in the middle of a "big drafting project"--revising Dennis' joint 
venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my 
concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this 
deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be 
revisited.   Thanks for your patience on this project.  DF

Drew, I have reviewed your performance review and action plan.  Just a couple 
of suggestions:  I would add any constructive feedback you have received from 
the clients.  I do not want her to perceive this review as only "what Drew 
thinks".  In the 'Performance Improvement Plan' I would add a time line to 
these expected improvements.  She must show significant improvement in the 
following areas during this next:  six months, 30 days, 60 days (whatever you 
deem appropriate).  I would also suggest one more action item.

"Lee must improve on collaboration efforts on projects.  She needs to take 
the initiative to seek expertise, assistance and direction from peers/clients 
to effectively complete projects.  This can be accomplished by openly 
communicating the status of projects with management and clients."

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

You correctly predicted my reaction.  I think we should let sleeping dogs 
lie.  Also, was it just an oversight that the FERC ignored the unsold 
capacity that TW controls in evaluating how much of the available capacity 
that Enron controls?  That conclusion is good for us, if it was intentional.

Subject: El Paso/ENA Negotiated Rate Order

I'm sure you've seen the order approving the El Paso/ENA transaction.  For 
the most part the order is a good one.  It observes that ENA holds little 
capacity on TW, and that PG&E and Socal control a larger portion of capacity 
on TW.   With respect to policy matters, the order is good in the sense that 
it reaffirms that a pipeline can withhold capacity to maximize the value of 
services if shippers are not willing to pay maximum rates.

My only concern with the order appears in the last paragraph before Section 
C.  Here the Commission cautions that its will address on an expedited basis 
future allegations that TW is not allocating capacity on a non-discriminatory 
basis.  Certainly the Commission has always had this authority anyway.  
Nonetheless, I am a little bit troubled that the Commission is addressing 
Transwestern at all in an El Paso order.   TW shouldn't have to read the 
orders of other pipelines for any directives that apply to it.    My knee 
jerk reaction is that we would want clarification that the Commission is just 
reiterating its general willingness to take up any bona fide complaints and 
is not imposing any directive on TW.  But, I'm guessing you'll probably say 
we should just let that sentence pass in an otherwise good order that does 
not involve TW.

a crude oil release in a subdivision near Midland, Texas.  The release 
involved a segment of pipe purchased by EOTT from the Texas-New Mexico 
Pipeline Company in May of 1999.  If EOTT is named as a defendant, we intend 
to file a cross claim against Tex-New Mex.  In that cross claim, we intend to

Another Tino-gram.  DOE disclosed to Team Tino that they pay a $7.06/mo 
demand charge per KW in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge.  Tino didn't 
know whether that was per KW of monthly demand, per KW of non-coincident peak 
usage, or what.  The PNM tariff for govt. service is priced at $7.16/KW of 
"demand above 10,000kw during peak period"  (peak period is daytime) so I 
assume that is how it is calculated.  If that is the tariff ("Schedule 
4000B") under which DOE really takes service, this is interesting because 
that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate.  It is also 
interesting that DOE is paying $.053/kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B 
energy rate is $.05072/kwh (maybe the difference is surcharges or something). 
Tino's consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an 
incremental $.011 in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge, for a total 
delivered PNM rate to DOE of $.064/kwh.  This is not as good as the 7 cent 
number Tino threw around earlier in the week, but its still not terrible.  If 
the bogey is a 10% reduction to the current rate, our number to beat is 
$.0576/kwh.  Tino promised us copies of DOE's actual energy bills to confirm 
these numbers.  That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you 
and I talked about yesterday, Kevin.    

Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta's consultant that the 
Cobisa Belen project is dead.  Do we know anything about this???  
Interesting.  I'm waiting to hear back from Bill Votaw to line up a due 
diligence call to Tino's government contracts lawyers in DC to confirm 
whether the "sole source" strategy is legit.  Kevin, I'll let you know when 
this is scheduled in case you want to be on the call.  Thanks.  DF

Barriers, Ground Monitoring Systems, Surge Protection, Process I/O,
Rotational Speed Application, or Intrinsically Safe Pneumatic Valves, please
click your reply button and note same.



Surge Protection for Telephone Modems

The proliferation of modems in electronic equipment is widespread today and
makes them susceptible to damage by surges.  The cause of this damage is the
potential voltage difference between the ground at the modem and the ground
at the telephone exchange.

When protecting telephone modems from surges, it is important to note that
the Telephone Company provides a gas discharge tube at its demarcation point
to protect the user from being shocked.  Since a gas discharge tube does not
fire until the voltage exceeds 700 Volts, the potential voltage difference
is already 700 Volts.  Added to that amount is the increase of voltage
difference that results from a ground wire length of at least 3 feet, and
thus the potential voltage difference before the discharge tube fires and
the device being protected is closer to 1200 Volts -- enough power to
destroy the device.

MTL's solution is the ZB24501 surge suppressor, a DIN rail mount model with
RJ45 connections.  It is UL listed, is only available in connector fashion,
and is easy to install --  the grounding connection is through the DIN rail.

The price for this unit is an inexpensive $32.00 -- considering the business
impact of damage to a modem, such a sum is money well spent.

To find out more on how you can benefit from an MTL solution in a variety of
applications, visit us at www.mtlnh.com, www.mtl-inst.com, and/or

I'm forwarding to each of you a fascinating document--Langley's proposal to 
the DOE.  It looks like he's already been fairly specific about the interest 
that the tribes will have in the various entities and contracts.  He also 
promised DOE a 10 % power cost reduction (before he even knew what they were 
currently paying).  He may have made some promises that are pretty to hard to 
deliver on.  Developers are amazing.  DF

Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20

2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow=

The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la=

Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I=

the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.

To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20

A couple of issues strike me as particularly important to report on tomorrow: 
(1) the TW train wreck--possible insurance coverage and strength of any claim 
against the railroad.  We ought to talk to Lou to make sure we have the 
latest info as I haven't talked to him since Thursday.  (2)  Status of 
possible litigation involving OneOk.  I don't think anyone has reported to 
Stan on the threatening noise from ONeOk about Praxair's rejection of the 
OneOk force majeure letter.  I'm sure MKM (or Dan on her behalf) will report 
that we are getting the strangers contract ready to send out, but she may not 
mention the Winston conversation with Charlie Graham.  I'll check the bullets 
again to see if anything else jumps out.  Talk to you at 8:30.  DF

These look good to me. My only question relates to Susan Scott and the 
suggestion that she sometimes bends over too far to satisfy her clients and 
thus might lose here effectiveness as the lawyer. This point is not 
mentioned. If you plan to cover this in the sitdown that is fine. I think it 
is a point that deserves mentioning to her.

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of a policy to be distributed 
to EOL/ENA employees. While the policy may seem over-restrictive, the fact 
basis upon which the policy is based is that the activities identified in the 
policy are currently performed by ENA employees. Of course, we still need to 
talk about this issue.

Subject: Pueblo

I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager for 
the Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and 
Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts 
team might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next 
week or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their 
outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the key--he 
is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my 
old firm in DC.  The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all 
through their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretations 
and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD.  Bill and Bill--does such a 
meeting sound productive?  If so, should we have outside govt. contracts 
counsel present and if so, who do you suggest?  

On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that 
he was in the middle of a "big drafting project"--revising Dennis' joint 
venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my 
concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this 
deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be 
revisited.   Thanks for your patience on this project.  DF

I have no great interest in appealing the FERC order denying rehearing.  This 
one is a loser as it was decided on TW-specific facts and I see no clear 
inconsistency between FERC's various orders on revenue sharing.   Unless 
someone feels strongly to the contrary, lets punt.  Thanks. DF

Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom 
of this synopsis, the web site address  will 
direct you to the full report released today if you would like further 
information.

EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term

A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural 
gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year 
in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from 
$2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's 
latest report. 

EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. 
economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up 
from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost 
overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 
2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 
2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for 
about half the change in energy projections. 

EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 
2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During 
the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural 
gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. 
"In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and 
production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases 
even as demand for these fuels grows." 

EIA projects world oil prices will reach $22.41/barrel (in 1999 dollars) in 
2020, up just slightly from the $22.04 in last year's forecast. 

The federal bean counters see a 1.8% average annual increase in power demand 
over the next 20 years, compared to the 1.3% they predicted last year. Prices 
will decline from the current 6.7 cents per kWh, but not as much as predicted 
last year due to the higher projected gas prices. Instead of 5.8 cents per 
kWh in 2020, EIA's AEO2001 sees electric rates holding at 6.0 cents per kWh. 

Power to be provided by nuclear generation jumped 34% from the forecast last 
year "due to lower estimated costs for extending the life of current nuclear 
plants and higher projected natural gas prices, although total nuclear 
generation still declines as some existing plants retire." 

Coal will still be the primary fuel for power generation, but its share will 
dwindle from 51% to 44% of the generating total.

Subject: Transport Options on TW

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After 
our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last 
draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
"market-based."   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a 
built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated 
into a separate option fee.  

The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and 
the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use 
transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they 
buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a 
service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If 
you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know.

I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some 
examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from 
a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options 
will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll 
circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas 
or questions.

As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing 
in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable 
meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some 
concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final 
tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss 
their questions?  Let me know what you think.

Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting 
first, and when FERC staff is available to talk.

Subject: Pueblo

Bill,

Yesterday, we decided to look at two options for Pueblo; a 60 MW case and a 
140 MW case.  In order to match these outputs as closely as possible with 
available equipment, I made the following selections:

Case 1
Equipment     3 X GE LM 2500 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 22 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   67 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  73.4 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  8170 Btu/kWh (HHV)

  
Case 2
Equipment     3 X GE LM 6000 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 44 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   130 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  143.7 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  7900 Btu/kWh (HHV)

There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized 
the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F 
for estimating power sales.  I have attached files that show the build-up of 
the estimated EPC price for the plants. 

The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file 
attached.  The projections are based on:

70% debt financing at 10% rate.
10-year project and debt life.
8500 hours per year at average output (97% capacity factor).
Gas at $4.40/MMBtu.

The results turn out pretty much as anticipated.  Even with the larger plant, 
we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.

Subject: Please RSVP: Lunch with Dan Larcamp of FERC on July 18


Dan Larcamp, Director of the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates will 
be visiting Enron on July 18.   I am planning for him to have lunch with a 
group of staff from the GPG at 11:30 (catered lunch in 50M).  Please RSVP at 
your earliest convenience whether you can participate in this lunch meeting 
and/or the topics that you would like to see us discuss.

The lunch discussion will be informal, but I think we should have two or 
three themes that we'd like to steer discussions towards.  Here are some 
tentative ideas.

How to Bring New Ideas to FERC.  Get Dan's suggestions on how to best work 
with FERC on new ideas.  Perhaps talk about capacity options as an example.
What were his Impressions about the Recent Outreach Meetings.  Did he hear 
anything new from any trade groups.   Is there any general feedback he'd like 
to give to pipelines as a group?
Get Dan to Talk about Expectations for the fall Order 637 Technical 
Conferences.  The first conference has been scheduled for Sept. 19.  What are 
the top issues on Staff's mind.  
What Does he expect to see in the upcoming RTO filings.  Are there Staff 
resources concerns that we should be aware of and/or any suggestions for gas 
filings during this time period? 


FYI - Here is an outline of what I tentatively has lined up for Dan's visit.
10:30-11:30 Trading Floor Visit  Christi Nicolay/Kevin Presto/Steve Kean
11:30-1  Lunch (50M)   GPG Staff
1-1:30  Gas Control Tour  Mike Bryant

Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue--i.e., are we cutting off 
shippers' supply due to force majeure?  

1.    If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly 
no.  We're shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the 
tariff quality spec., not due to force majeure.  We have the discretion to 
grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent 
operators and so long as we don't discriminate.   If that gas is out of spec 
on any of the specific items listed in the "Quality" section of the tariff 
(Sec. 44?  47?  I can't remember which but its one of those) then the answer 
is the same.  

2.  If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the 
answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons 
falling out as liquids.  I'm remembering the catch all section of the Quality 
paragraph as prohibiting "dirt, gums, and other impurities that would 
interfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah" or something to that 
effect.  That catch all seems to me to include liquids.  IF the c6 and 
heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people 
delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no 
force majeure.   I read Eric's very scientific email and I think the punch 
line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?   The 
thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. 
limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers 
are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't 
work as good.  

3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we 
could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an 
event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.

I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF

Shelley Corman tells me that Drew Fossum (General Counsel of NNG) was 
primarily responsible for working up the part of NNG's rate case insofar as 
the (unsuccessful, I'm afraid) request for market based storage was 
concerned.  Shelley has graciously volunteered to talk to you about the 
general  background on the concept, and is sending you part of the NNG 
filings that dealt with the market based storage request.  Feel free to call 
her, and Drew might also be a valuable, if willing, resource.

Per Tim's discussion with Chandler, they do not attach the brown cover, but

Subject: Daily California Update.....

CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing
A special session yesterday of California's regulators gave PG&E's utility 
authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state 
past Feb. 7 when the current federal DOE emergency order expires, but it 
postponed action on another PG&E request that Southern California Gas Co. --- 
which has strongly objected --- be compelled to provide emergency supplies to 
the PG&E utility's residential and small business customers. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said 
PG&E's utility is a "victim --- a victim of circumstances and a victim of 
predatory practices by natural gas suppliers," now demanding payment for 
future supplies up front --- not because the utility has failed to pay its 
past gas bills, but because the electricity crisis has sapped its 
credit-worthiness. 
The CPUC action allows PG&E's utility to offer suppliers the option of 
securitization or, in effect, a lien, in the utility's retail customers' 
bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive 
to have the suppliers extend contracts with PG&E's gas utility operations 
while the credit-worthiness of the company itself is dubious. It won't be 
until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts, that it 
will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend 
contracts in the current situation, according to PG&E gas utility 
spokesperson Staci Homrig. 
On the operational side, PG&E on Wednesday declared a low-inventory OFO 
because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline 
shippers were bringing into the system. The action was thought to help cause 
the PG&E citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on Wednesday. As for reports 
of low storage, Homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, 
they are adequate for the next week. They are not dipping into cushion or 
base gas at this point, Homrig said. 
Lynch said that PG&E has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in 
what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance 
payments or payment at the time supplies are provided. "These gas suppliers 
are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of 
flesh," Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure. "Suppliers who 
have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 
'pay us today.' They are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the 
commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PG&E amend these 
agreements in order to keep the gas flowing." 
Part of the CPUC's action places a 90-day limit on the securitization option, 
so with the way gas contracts work, in effect, it only provides about another 
30 days' worth of supplies, said Homrig, who noted that almost all of PG&E's 
25 to 30 suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements (advances, 
cash-on-delivery or letters of credit) that the company cannot accommodate 
because of its cash-flow crisis.~ Out of ongoing negotiations, the parties 
came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables, 
thus, assuring them they will get paid. 
On the gas side, PG&E has had sufficient revenues --- unlike its electric 
business --- but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a 
normal payment arrangement because of the severe credit-rating decline in the 
past weeks. 
The CPUC met in San Francisco late Wednesday afternoon in the midst of a 
whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor, state legislature, 
consumer groups, regulators and utilities. A key piece was missing, however. 
California state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was 
to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy 
crisis. Reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of 
who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy 
business. A spokesman for the assembly speaker's office said he had no idea 
when the briefing would be re-scheduled. 
One piece of legislation that got through the state Senate (SB 1X) yesterday 
authorizes another $500 million in emergency funds to purchase power. It also 
would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities' 
wholesale power supplier under long-term contracts at least through 2002. The 
measure drew a protest from CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, who argued that 
the state agency be "removed from that role as quickly as possible." The 
bill, which was first passed by the state Assembly, was returned to assembly 
committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate. It then would 
have to be ratified again by the Assembly. 
Meanwhile, consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the 
state bail-out of the private-sector utilities. This prompted at least one of 
the utilities, Southern California Edison, to come out swinging, saying that 
the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any 
"windfall profits" or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent 
company. 
A letter surfaced in Washington from Gov. Gray Davis to the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, dated Jan. 30 and outlining measures the state 
is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand, sign long-term 
contracts and maintain the financial viability of the state's public 
utilities. The letter, a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported 
here, contained no specifics on any long-term contracts nor legislation 
signed that would address the immediate problem. Davis outlined measures 
being taken to speed up siting of new power plants, saying an additional 
2,000 MW would be online by the end of the year. 
Responding to questions on another arena, Edison International's senior vice 
president Tom Higgins said "everything is on the table" in the ongoing 
negotiations between Davis' three-person negotiating team and the two 
utilities, including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in Los 
Angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities' own generation 
against the whopping wholesale power cost under-collections. 
The state remained under a power watch for the 16th day as the California 
independent grid operator (Cal-ISO) urged conservation because "reserves 
remain very low."

Drew, thanks so much for your messages yesterday.  Received the e-mail and 
look forward to discussing it with you - I definitely think I can fit it in 
with my other work (at least I would like to give it a shot).  You know how 
things go...  everything is supposed to happen at once but it never does.  Kim

Subject: ECS Gallup contract

Here are some bullet points based on our conversation Friday morning 
regarding the ECS Compression Service Agreement.  These bullet points 
summarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a 
conversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined) 
regarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of 
the lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have 
additional comments, please let me know.  

We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that 
up to you, but do let me know if I can help. 

-  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a 
monitoring system that would automatically 
alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  

-  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission 
for TW to access the "Members Only" portion of CDEC's website (which contains 
load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a 
confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.

-  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on 
the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   "Good faith" 
by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any 
difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted 
in this regard.  

-  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load 
times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers 
with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this, 
but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have 
access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.

-  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July 
could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it 
did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information 
from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should 
therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.

-  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring 
system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the 
website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.

I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of 
the website; I'll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted 
"on a case-by-case basis."  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you 
know what I'm able to learn from them.

Subject: RSVP: August 25 - Introduction to the Electric Industry


By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.

I am OK on selling these packages on EOL.  This approval is based on my 
understanding that all of this capacity is currently posted, or, if not 
currently posted, will be posted for the appropriate amount of time prior to 
sale.  Additionally, this approval is contingent on use of the webtext we 
have been using for other EOL deals (I feel the need to say the obvious 
because I don't believe Law will see anything on these packages again).  I 
also assume that these will be short term deals--i.e., less than one year.  
Any long term discounted deals raise concerns that our "standard discount 
language" is designed to address, such as what is the effect of a new rate 
design or reduction in the max rate on the discounted deal.  I think we can 
live without that language in short term deals for now, but we need to 
revisit this issue and come up with a solution before we sell any long term 
deals on EOL.  ONe last thing, it is marketing's decision whether to include 
in the webtext the provision that says Northern gets the $$ if the shipper 
releases the capacity at a rate higher than the discounted rate.  I think our 
approach in negotiated deals has been to get that agreement if we could (a 
basis run up could make it a very valuable right).  If you have any 
questions, call me.  DF

***  EOL ROUTING ***

Please send your approval by return email, to Craig Buehler, for the EOL 
packages listed on
the attached spreadsheet.  Each of the packages (22 in total) shows the path, 
sustainable capacity
and proposed rate for each product.  The rates are estimated to provide a 
measure for the dollar
amount of the discount (per our current discount policy).  These 22 products 
are the initial deals
being offered; subsequent packages will be routed as they are developed.  
Please call Craig, at
713-853-6964, if you have questions.  After approval by Legal, Reg Affairs 
and Marketing, the
approvals and/or comments will be forwarded to Danny McCarty for review.

Thanks,

Rich,
Thanks for the note.  If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our 
next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to 
operate their Griffith system.  We can "hedge" our proposal based on the need 
to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be 
necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting 
word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be.

Randy from operations side we wouldn't have a problem operating the system if 
it can be worked out through legal. If it's decided that we will do this 
there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost 
together if you would like.
Thanks 
Rich

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Drew, Tom has informed me that Enron has never paid for the table that Tim 
Aron got for the Secretary Richardson fundraiser (last April) and the tab is 
$2500.  I know in hindsight we may not want to give Richardson any money 
since he blew his chance at becoming VP (just joking) but we do need to pay.  
Tom's email address is above and perhaps he can tell you where to mail the 
check.

I also have a couple of other obligations that Tim Aron undertook that I need 
to follow up on, has someone been hired, or should I go through you?

Thanks.

Well, I've gotten myself into a fine kettle of fish.  Got any advice on how 
to handle the new job?  (or is this like asking the one legged man how to 
avoid land mines?)

First,  I thought the inservice was to be earlier than 3rd quarter??  confused
Second, on term I'd suggest we say a minimum of five years, so if someone 
wants to bid for a longer term they can--
Third, in the 3rd paragraph change the reference to term, to as specifed 
above-
Fourth, in the last paragraph, add minimum term of five years again.

Yes, I thought was to not take back space in the EOT area since we have some 
available and were not looking to expand there.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

Do we need to give notice to customers before we shut in receipt points due 
to off-spec gas?  Sec. 44 of the NN tariff implies to me that if a customer's 
gas has too much water, for example, we can shut it in at any time without 
notice.  Please confirm ASAP.  DF

To: Enron Transportation Services Operations@ENRON
Subject: Organization Announcement



Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

Why would PGT do that????  If there was that much demand, you'd think they 
would have been able to extract a neg. rate deal for something north of max 
for a shorter term.  Maybe that shipper demanded the recourse rate.  Weird.  
By the way--good memo to Shelley on Red Rock.  df

Rumor on the street is that the entire 200 MMcf/d of capacity in the PGT-NW

Eric, I think it would be good for you to join us for this meeting.  We're 
following up on some concerns that arose during the Conoco case about 
inadequate compliance with Enron document retention policies.  I'm not sure 
that this subject is within your turf down there, but your historical 
experience may be useful.

Subject: Re: Document Retention discussion  

Great!!  Here's my question--what responsibility does the legal department 
have to publicize/enforce the Enron document retention policy in other 
departments?  If it isn't our responsibility, whose is it?  I'm concerned 
based on our experience in the Conoco case that most departments 
(occasionally including law) simply ignore the policy.  

I think this subject matter is so interesting that I'm asking the regulatory, 
marketing, and market services departments to send a designated 
representative to attend.   Mary Kay and Julia--please have someone on your 
staff whose responsibility includes managing your inventory of paper join us 
in the VCRs on Oct 10 at 1:30.  We'll be reviewing the Enron document 
retention policies and how to improve our compliance within NN and TW.  
Julia, for your group Rick or someone in his group would probably be best.  
MKM, I'm not sure who is the best person from your group.  Steve, I suspect 
you are the right guy from marketing mostly because you've got more 
experience in the regulatory/legal discovery area than most of your 
colleagues down there.  Sorry. If each of the Marketing, Mkt Services, and 
Regulatory representatives could bring what they believe is the current 
document retention policy/schedule for your group, that would be helpful.   
Thanks.  DF

your questions early so that Colleen and I can provide a thorough answer at 
the meeting.


(Seriously, if there's anything specific you would like to know or if you 
have any questions about document retention, let Colleen or me know.  Thanks!)

Excellent!  I hope Briden's project attracts fewer vultures than Dennis 
Langley's.  I need to go to Midland on the afternoon of the 12th, so could 
meet in Houston conveniently on the morning of the 12th or anytime 10 am or 
later on the 11th.  I could meet on the 10 th after 10, but less 
conveniently.  Just let Martha know what the plan is and she'll deploy me.  
Also,  when you say they want TW to "build, own and operate the plant" you 
mean the gas pipeline facilities, not the power plant, right?  Must be 
because $20 mil. would be a pretty cheap power plant.  Thats a pretty cheap 
pipeline also for the length--about 40 miles, right?  DF

Subject: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC. Project

The project's consultant, George Briden, of Snake Hill Energy, called me 
today to say that Caithness Corp. has decided to move forward with plans for 
the Big Sandy, LLC. Project.  To refresh your memory, the project is a 
proposed IPP to be located about 40 miles south of TW's pipeline along 
Highway 93, about 2 miles outside of Wickieup, Arizona.  I've attached a 
simple bitmap below (click on it and hit "view") indicating the location of 
the project relative to Transwestern's facilities.  Ultimately, the project 
would be built for approx. 1,000 MW of generation in two phases.  Phase 1 
will burn approx. 80,000 Dth/d, and phase 2 will burn an additional 120,000 
Dth/d.  Initial indications are for the project to be in service in early 
2002, with the lateral pipeline and gas service required as early as Q2, 2001.

Caithness Corp., based in New York, is a privately held company with diverse 
interests including geothermal (renewable) electric generation facilities 
(Coso Plant) in California.  George reported that Caithness would like for 
Transwestern to build, own and operate the plant with facility costs (current 
estimate, $20.3MM) to be amortized vis-a-vis a throughput/rate commitment.  
Caithness would also like the project to be interconnected to El Paso's 
system and the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline if that project should ever 
be completed.

Obviously, we'll have to wade throught the legal/regulatory issues 
surrounding this deal structure, as well as the requisite credit assurances.  
With respect to the former, I think if we view this pipeline 
ownership/operation structure more as a financing mechanism with associated 
operating agreements, then we're probably OK.  With respect to the later, 
George assured me that Caithness can/will set-up a funding mechanism that 
would give Transwestern sufficient assurance of payback.

George would like to bring down a couple of representatives from Caithness to 
meet with Transwestern sometime the week of July 10.  He suggested either 
Omaha or Houston for the meeting, inasmuch as he'd like Drew Fossum to be 
present.

Drew, I'm thinking it might be easier/better to have the meeting here in 
Houston given our immediate access to maps and engineering data regarding the 
lateral pipeline.  If you concur, what day(s) do you have open that week and 
is there an opportunity for you to hop Bill's plane for either one or both 
legs of the trip down here?  I'll ask Ron Matthews and maybe one or two 
others to join us so we can cover a fairly broad base of functions in one 
sitting.

Will you get back with me as soon as you can?  Others on the distribution, if 
you can sit tight we'll get you more information as this meeting date/time 
comes together.  Thanks.

Anonymous Letters Put UtiliCorp in Hot Water

Investigations in several states are getting under way into alleged illegal 
profit-taking by UtiliCorp United in Missouri, Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota 
and Iowa. An anonymous letter from someone who claimed to be a current 
employee for UtiliCorp was sent to state regulators alleging the company's 
Gas Supply Service Department (GSS) took part in improper actions in 
reselling natural gas to customers in these states. 

"Personnel are paid bonuses based on the value that can be extracted from 
managing the assets paid for by the Missouri Public Service (MPS) 
ratepayers," the letter said. The anonymous author said that value is 
extracted in numerous ways that are undetectable to staff audit efforts. One 
method included in the letter was for UtiliCorp employees to sell a first of 
the month "put" to suppliers, invoicing the put premium on a separate invoice 
that would never be included in audited documentation. If prices drop, the 
supplier puts first of the month gas to MPS. 

Another scheme alleged in the letter includes capacity releases. "Operations 
personnel extract one-to-two cents per release by doing buy-sells with MPS 
capacity, instead of doing a posted release," said the letter. "They look at 
the lowest credit amount possible to report, instead of maximizing the 
capacity release credit." The anonymous author speculated that these actions 
are taken to reach the unit's lofty profit goal of $10 million. "Due to the 
emphasis on earnings, GSS's top priority is earnings, not providing 
efficient, reliable, economic gas supplies," the author concluded. 

Jerry Cosley, a UtiliCorp United spokesperson said, "We can say without 
qualification, that in no way would we approve of any improper behavior or 
business practice, so we are conducting our own review." 

Missouri appears to be the first state out of the gate on the investigation 
trail as the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission has recommended 
an investigation be conducted into the allegations. An MPS representative 
said that UtiliCorp denied the allegations of impropriety, but supports the 
staff's request to open an investigation. 

Iowa's Consumer Advocate is investigating the UtiliCorp charges in that 
state, said Chuck Seel, a spokesman for the Iowa Utilities Board. Seel said 
the Iowa and Minnesota letters, and the Michigan and Missouri letters, 
appeared to be similar to one another. He added that an observer from the IUB 
and a representative of the Consumer Advocate will attend a meeting next week 
with UtiliCorp to discuss the situation. 

Cosley said UtiliCorp intends to conduct its own internal review, and would 
stay in touch with all of the affected regulatory commissions and report its 
findings to them.

I've deferred the negotiation with Mark Knippa given my need for some 
information from James and Kevin on our ability to avoid peak usage, etc.  
Steve Harris and I talked this morning about settlement authority and our 
going in position, obviously, is that ECS should pick up the whole $300+ K.  
I expect that Knippa will angle toward a split the difference approach and 
then try to put his share of the value on some future deal.  To counter 
that,  I think I'll need to hit him pretty firmly on the "relationship 
issue."  I.e., he's got to fix this problem or his chance of doing more deals 
with the pipeline group will be seriously hurt.  That should be a big deal to 
him and may get us the resolution we need.  To push that I need three things 
from you:
1.  Rod, have we already communicated to ECS, or at a higher level like 
Redmond, that we won't do any more deals with them?  Obviously if we have 
already told them we're done working with them, my threat won't carry much 
weight.
2.  Are you all OK with the threat?  I suspect that our threat to quit doing 
business with them will go immediately up their chain of command and that 
Redmond or someone will call Stan to complain.  
3.  Can we agree conceptually to do future deals if Knippa needs a bucket to 
put our dollars in?  He may propose something specific and I'd like to be 
able to agree that we will "work with them" on future deals.  

Thanks.  DF

Subject: Risk Management Caminus

David Port, ETS is purchasing a trading system from Caminus to track their 
transactions.  Included in this system are position reports which the 
Accounting Department will be using to report and determine compliance with 
the attached policy and procedures, including open positions, VAR, MTM, 
approval limits, Greeks, credit risk, stress testing, basis positions, 
confirmations and invoicing.  The ETS Risk Management policy requires that 
our reporting conform to the corporate standards, accordingly your name was 
given to me as the person who could help direct some of the more technical 
reporting standards.

Caminus is doing an introduction to their system today from 12:00 am to 3 pm 
in 49c2, however I know you will not be back in town until next week.  Vernon 
Mercaldo is coordinating the installation of the system and will be needing 
your input relating to Corporate reporting standards.  As the project 
progresses he will be contacting you.

Attached are drafts of the ETS Policy and Procedures.

Subject: Pueblo

 Just got an update on the project that won't go away.  Dennis has a meeting 
lined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.  He is going to pitch the 
project as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read 
"financed by") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\or third 
parties (read "Enron"?).  Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get 
a more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, 
even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas 
load.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics 
using about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis' 
argument is going to be:  "I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and 
the power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you."  
"You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, 
you will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or 
escalate, you lose."    Either way, your reliability improves and you kick 
PNM in the shins."  Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on 
this.  By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign, 
and won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even 
more publicity.  You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely 
to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or 
cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.  They think his real 
angle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor 
out there!!  Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got 
hosed and made a scapegoat unfairly.  
 I've asked  Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together 
to give to Tino to confirm whether his $2 price is wacky.  Other than that, I 
just told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the 
project if the risks and rewards make sense, and that EE&CC might be 
interested in the design/build on all of it.  He said he'd get back to me 
after the 25th meeting and tell me whether the project is undead.  DF

Tino,  this was easier than I thought!  Just eyeballing the numbers, it looks 
like $2.00 may even be on the high side on a 24 month or 18 month average 
basis.   I wasn't sure which email to use so I used both.  Let me know how 
your meeting goes.  DF

I pulled TW San Juan (Blanco) prices off the RDI database for January 1, 1998 
through June 8, 2000 (the most current in the database).  If you need to have 
the remainder of June and the first part of July input, let me know.  The

I'm not aware of any legal or regulatory prohibition on our performing such a 
service for Citizens.  We can't actually buy the assets without a FERC 
certificate, but that's not what you are suggesting.   I can think of one 
example on NN in which Northwestern Pub. Service owns a some branch lines and 
we operate them.  Whether we do it as a separate legal entity or as TW is a 
strategy call that will depend on whether we want to keep the revenue stream 
out of the regulated pipeline entity.  Since TW doesn't have a rate case 
until 2006, there is probably no reason to put the contract in a separate 
entitiy until we get down the road a ways.

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Ugh.  Do we need to say "from storage inventory" or can we just mention gas 
sales?  I seem to recall that we already discussed that and the accountants 
wanted to mention the source of the sold gas, but if I'm wrong, lets make the 
reference less specific.  Thanks. DF

SoCal's protest is ludicrous. I will work on a response.
By the way, SoCal has actually been remarkably helpful in reaching agreement 
on a settlement -- which we just signed -- in the California GIR proceeding.

Note new cost limits for building laterals within our existing blanket 
authorization (i.e., without seeking a specific certificate).  The $$ is 
probably still not high enough to give us ability to build the whole project, 
but it may give us some flexibility.  Thanks MKM.  
Also, has any one heard from Tino or Dennis in the last week or so?  I left 
Tino some voicemails on a question he had left for me, and the name of the 
Enron windmill guy, but haven't heard back.  Do we need to schedule a 
follow-up meeting with them to talk about turbine availability and regulatory 
options, etc? DF

Sounds reasonable to me.  When do we sign?  Seriously, this just confirms in 
my mind that Langley isn't looking very closely at the economics of the deal 
because he doesn't have any capital or O & M numbers (or heat rates) on the 
generation equipment so he has no idea how thick or thin the margins might be 
on this project.  Once we are able to show him some economics he will 
presumably be in a position to be reasonable on the issues discussed below.  
If he's not willing to be reasonable, we're done talking to him.

Subject: Pueblo project

 I spoke to Dennis Langley yesterday about his ideas on the financial stake 
he is looking for in the project. There are several items which will need to 
be included in our economic analysis as they will burden the project . The 
conditions are as follows:

- Dennis needs (wants) to recover the O&M for his idea-generating group which 
he estimates to be $2 to $3 million per year!  
- Share with Dennis a 50/50 split of any incremental revenue TW receives on 
its existing line as a result of additional capacity sold to serve these 
markets!
- A 50/50 split of any revenue received on the new line which is built .
- The Native American tribe(s) will receive 25% of ownership in the assets 
and 25% of the cashflow stream after payout (he mentioned something about an 
IRR of 8% being the threshold).

 His general feeling was that the pipeline should be a 50/50 joint venture 
but the gas-fired generation plant would be ours. James will need to run the 
numbers but my uneducated guess says that if things were slim before these 
financial hits will certainly render the project uneconomic (especially the 
$2 to $3 million/year extra O&M). He did indicate that they are having very 
good conversations with the DOE and would expect to sign a contract in April. 
I am somewhat  puzzled by what he could commit to since he would have no idea 
what rates he could charge for the electricity or gas transportation.

 I told Dennis we would follow-up with him shortly. In the meantime, we will 
be working with Mark Baldwin to scope out the opportunities in New 
Mexico.

Enron Energy Services is presently a marketing affiliate of several of the=

Under the FERC's standards of conduct, the pipelines cannot: (1) share=20

respect to the described arrangement under the FERC's marketing affiliate=

standards of conduct:

1. Records -- FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate "access" to=

transportation and shipper records (including something as simple as file=

room access) is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a=
=20
marketing affiliate in violation of the standards. Thus, it seems to me tha=
t=20
EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function=

for NNG, TW or NBPL.

2. Billing -  FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully.  In a recent=

operate separately.  It would be helpful if any EES facility management=20
charges/allocations come from Enron Facility Services (not EES) --  leaving=

us room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate=

Drew, I think your last question is the one most critical to us at this 
point. The marketers can go out and start selling the project but are having 
a hard time defining how the capacity will be allocated. I left a message 
yesterday for Mary K. regarding these same issues. Thanks.

Subject: TW Expansion

There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the 
close of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial 
thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  

Q 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?  

A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were 
certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction 
is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an 
alternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements 
for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are 
executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it 
will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert. 
app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given 
the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to 
sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the 
capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a 
combination of both.  

Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options 
(to steal Jeff's term), like the following:
 1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or 
whatever number we decide on)
 2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges
 3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah
 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly 
this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and 
fuel retainage percentages)

A.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for 
1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve 
Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated 
rate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach 
could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking 
our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a 
7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would be 
a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can tell a 
customer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for 
the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options 
of our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this is 
sticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure.  

Q.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility do 
we have in structuring the options?  

A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose 
to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want to 
be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at 
$.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have 
discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we 
can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better 
deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we 
deliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by 
offering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and 
$.35 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to 
obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.            

Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???

A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it 
the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, 
Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d 
of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 
mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want 
option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That 
really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand 
first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else?  
Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be 
deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone may 
be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the 
recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the 
neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective 
nondiscriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh. 

Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answered 
already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are 
easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your 
convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get out 
and sell this stuff.  DF

Subject: Article in WSJ: "Movies-on-Demand May Finally Turn Blockbuster's 
Stock into a Hit"

Drew, 

This was in today's WSJ, but I don't see anything prior to that that isn't a 
month old or more on the Blockbuster deal.  There was an announcement on the 
wires on September 6 dealing with the n-Cube technology that will be used in 
the Blockbuster deal.  Let me know if this is it!

Lorna  
-----------------------------------------------------
09/20/2000  
The Wall Street Journal  
 
Texas Journal  
T2  
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  
  
 
  
Blockbuster hasn't enjoyed a great market reception. 

In fact, it has fared so poorly since going public 13 months ago that today 
you can pick up a share of the Dallas video-rental giant for the price of a 
video rental and a couple of late fees. 
 
  
But analysts who have promoted the stock from its initial public offering in 
August 1999 say now is a better time than ever to bet on Blockbuster. They 
say the company is poised to capitalize both on its ubiquitous stores and the 
emerging market for delivering movies over the Internet. 
"There are a lot of factors that make it incredibly attractive," says Patrick 
J. O'Hare, an analyst in Chicago with briefing.com, an online market-analysis 
firm. 

For starters, Blockbuster, with 5,000 blue-and-yellow stores in the U.S. 
alone, is the leading video retailer and one of the country's best-known 
brand names. Its stock, which closed yesterday at $9.188, looks inexpensive. 
Blockbuster is also moving beyond its storefronts. In July, Blockbuster 
signed a 20-year agreement to sell movies over the growing broadband network 
being built by Houston-based Enron. 

There's more. Mr. O'Hare notes that the company's earnings are expected to 
grow at a 20% annual clip over the next five years, while the stock trades at 
a relatively inexpensive 14 times earnings. In 2001, the company's earnings 
are projected to grow by 28%. So by one measure, Blockbuster trades for about 
half that rate. The stock also trades for less than one third of its book 
value. 

Of course, the stock price has been depressed for a long time, ever since 
majority owner Viacom sold 18% of Blockbuster in an IPO. (New York-based 
Viacom plans to distribute the rest to its shareholders, but is waiting for 
the price to rise.) Blockbuster ended its first day of trading at $15, its 
offering price. It went down from there and bottomed out at $8.88 on June 27. 

Not even a better-than-expected second-quarter financial report on Aug. 2 
helped much. The company lost 16 cents a share, compared with a 28-cent net 
loss a year earlier. Excluding losses from new-media initiatives, such as 
development of its Blockbuster.com Web site, it posted cash earnings of $24.1 
million, or 14 cents a share, which beat analysts' expectations. 

Analysts say the news will improve, with a consensus estimate that 
Blockbuster will earn 64 cents a share before charges this year. The company 
also expects its market share to reach at least 35% this year, four times 
that of its nearest competitor, Hollywood Entertainment's Hollywood Video. 

It adds up to rosy projections. Briefing.com's Mr. O'Hare says the stock 
could double in the next 12 to 18 months. Salomon Smith Barney analyst David 
Riedel in New York has a $26 target price, also in 12 to 18 months. (Mr. 
Riedel's firm was an underwriter for Blockbuster's IPO.) 

So why has the stock languished? One culprit is the new-media initiatives, 
which are obscuring the company's profits elsewhere. And, as Blockbuster 
Chief Executive John Antioco noted recently when warning that third-quarter 
revenue would be slow, there have been few recent big hits among the new 
video releases. 

Mr. Antioco also acknowledges there may be confusion over how well 
Blockbuster is mixing its traditional retail business with the advent of 
movies-on-demand and other new-media ventures. Indeed, for all Blockbuster's 
talk about new media, it doesn't yet deliver movies electronically and 
customers still can't do things like reserve movies by using Blockbuster.com. 
Thus far, customers can do little more than buy videos and digital videodisks 
on the Web site. 

"Perhaps the story may be more complicated than some people have time for," 
Mr. Antioco says. "People who buy retail stocks don't fully understand our 
story, and people who buy media stocks may not totally understand the 
transition." In the end, the company will be a mix of new media and 
traditional retailing. But until that picture becomes clearer, the result, 
Mr. Antioco says, "is the stock malaise." 

But Mr. Antioco says Blockbuster is now in an ideal position. The company has 
delivered solid earnings from its core video-store business and has struck 
potentially big deals to bring movies to consumers in their homes. 
"Blockbuster, as a pure retail play, has done what it said it's going to do," 
Mr. Antioco says. "Now we have several [new-media] plays beyond that." 

Indeed, just this year Blockbuster has entered into five deals to supplement 
its in-store rentals through showings of movies on outlets such as DirecTV, a 
unit of Hughes Electronics, El Segundo, Calif. 

The agreement with the most potential, analysts say, is the Enron deal, in 
which Blockbuster will distribute movies over the energy giant's broadband 
network to set-top boxes in consumers' homes. Mr. Antioco says Blockbuster 
will be delivering movies in a couple of markets served by Enron's network by 
the end of the year and predicts that will be just a prelude to a wider 
rollout in 2001. 

Certainly, there are potential stumbling blocks. To make the deal work, Enron 
and Blockbuster need digital-subscriber-line providers to step up enrollment 
and solve the spotty service and technical glitches that have plagued large 
numbers of users. 

"The issue for Blockbuster is going to be availability," says Mike Goodman, a 
senior analyst with Yankee Group, a market-research firm in Boston. Yankee 
projects there will be 1.45 million DSL users by the end of this year, 
increasing to about 8.4 million in 2004. 

That's a substantial number of subscribers, but it's also just a potential 
customer base for Blockbuster. Mr. Antioco says the digital future is a ways 
off -- it may be 10 years before revenue from electronic delivery of movies 
catches up with video-store revenue. 

Even the beginning of the DSL-dependent rollout will take up to a couple of 
years, according to Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. It says movies 
won't be delivered to more than a few markets until sometime in 2002 -- not 
2001, as Blockbuster predicts. But Mr. Antioco says agreements with the 
regional phone companies that provide DSL will bear fruit sooner and that the 
company will soon announce other partners such as a maker of the set-top 
boxes needed to order movies. 

Briefing.com's Mr. O'Hare argues that now is the time to buy because 
Blockbuster's stock could move fast once investors grasp the possibilities of 
the company's plan for multimedia distribution. 

Both Mr. O'Hare and Salomon Smith Barney's Mr. Riedel classify Blockbuster as 
particularly risky but say the company's outside-the-store initiatives should 
serve as a catalyst for the stock over the next 18 or so months. 

Mr. O'Hare says that time frame may not be compatible with investors' "notion 
of instant gratification." But, he says, "it's worth it 
in this case."

Vector Pipeline has appointed Craig R. Fishbeck as president of Vector. 
Vector believes that Fishbeck's extensive industry experience and knowledge 
of Vector's market area position him well to lead the company through its 
December 2000 start-up and coming years of growth. The pipeline also believes 
Fishbeck's appointment strengthens Vector's role as a vital link between the 
Chicago Hub and Dawn, Ontario, to help meet the growing demand for natural 
gas in the U.S. Midwest, Eastern Canada and the U.S. Northeast. Fishbeck 
comes to Vector from CMS - Panhandle where he held the position of vice 
president, marketing.

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

Subject: Message Points for FERC Briefing on GPG's Use of EOL


I'm currently scheduled to meet with Kevin Madden and other members of OMTR, 
including hopefully Mike Coleman, Rob Cupina and Alice Fernandez, next Wed. 
May 31 to give them a heads-up on GPG's upcoming use of EOL.  I also hope to 
meet with several of the Commissioners' assistants.  The timing of the 
meeting is to ensure that we get to them prior to a press release.

The approach is decidely low key.   There is a feeling that if we make a big 
deal of this with FERC, then they will ask a lot of questions about why we 
aren't filing for permission.  Hopefully, if we explain that it doesn't 
change any of our current practices, that its just a new computer tool, they 
will chalk it up as another ecommerce story.  

I hope to talk about the GPG's use of EOL generally and not get deep into the 
mechanics of the specific TW auction.  The advantage of me doing the FERC 
briefing is that I can talk generally and claim that I'm not privy to the 
details of each of the pipelines possible EOL products.

Attached is a rough outline of my message points and a few Q&As that I have

Here is the latest on timetable on Gallup.  Susan, please get your edits on 
the draft to Donna and me by tomorrow.  (call me if you need more guidance on 
what I have in mind).   Donna or Keith, please let me know what additioonal 
information you are waiting on and what the likely timetable for filing is.  
Also, Keith, what was the answer from ops/planning on whether unloading the 
20,000 of fuel from the San Juan would help with more flexibility or 
capacity?  If you haven't been able to get a meaningful answer, let me know 
who to call and I'll try.

Subject: Re: Gallup Mods  

I agree with Danny's email that the key timetable issue for the incremental 
10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the 
15,000hp motor.  It was my understanding that the long lead time items were 
going to be ordered shortly (if they haven't been already) and that we'd take 
the financial risk.  If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals won't 
be the critical path item they usually are.  I've reviewed the FERC 
application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a request 
for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would expedite 
things.  Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would allow us to 
avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San Juan lateral.  
If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan, the additional 
horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional flexibility or additional 
capacity.   I'll talk to Steve today to make sure we are doing everything 
possible to expedite these efforts.  DF

I believe that Phil Lowry is looking at ways to get some additional capacity 
out of the system as well.  We want to expedite these efforts too..  I would 
like to see an application filed filed by January 31st to get 30 to 50 
MMCF/D. 

Steve Harris and Phil Lowry should have the lead to get this done.  I am 
willing to construct at risk but want to see the financials as well.

     How is life?  Things here are going very well; just extremely hectic
(which, I guess, comes as no surprise).  I am giving you plenty of advance
notice; we are getting married on Sunday, September 2, the Sunday of Labor Day
weekend in New York. We have scheduled this in part to accomodate our dear
friends from out of town such that they do not have to take the Monday off 
work.
Details to follow, but no excuses!  it has been far too long since I saw you,
and cannot imagine a happier occasion.  I will check in over the next few days
to hear how life is for you, and hope and trust it is all well.  Talk to you
soon, David & Joy

ON further reflection, if Mavrix is to be a wholly owned sub of Enron 
Pipeline Company (or whatever the current name is of the top-tier ETS entity) 
then that entity ought to issue the guaranty.  Mavrix intends to buy capacity 
from TW and possibly NN.  It would be innappropriate to have TW issue the 
guaranty if TWs guaranty would likely operate in favor of TW.  Same for NN.

Subject: Re: Mavrix  

The consideration isn't the point, its the fact that a creditworthy party, 
Enron for instance, has guaranteed the business and in fact they are 
creditworthy.    Therefore we haven't given Mavrix a special deal compared to 
other shippers, since they are now by way of the guarantee creditworthy.    
As I told you on the phone, Enron will do this for others as well, it's just 
not cheap, it's like dealing with the guys in the pool hall!

Subject: Re: Mavrix  

What is the objective of having Mavrix pay its parent/affliate (ETS) a 
guarantee fee?   Will this prove that granting credit was 
non-discriminatory?  I would argue no, since we don't look at the 
consideration paid for guarantees of other companies.  The fact that a 
credit-worthy party has issued a guarantee should be enough.  Legally, Mavix 
is a separate company.  Parent companies frequently guarantee obligations of 
subsidiaries without any direct consideration (other than enabling their 
subsidiary to transact business).

First, Mavrix is a subsidiary of what company?     I don't believe I have 
seen that anywhere, but had heard that it was TW.   If it is not a subsidiary 
of NNG why would NNG issue a guaranty for Mavrix?     I can have the 
guarantee priced and then Mavrix can pay to have someone guarantee it's 
positions.     This is not rocket science, but I believe we need to make an 
effort to keep things looking like they are at arms length and that this is a 
separate company.     If you all agree, let me know and I can have someone 
get with Steve Harris and get the guaranty priced.

For Jerry and John:   Let me know but I think we can get this priced down 
here inside the day.     Let me know how you want to proceed.

I guess you wouldn't want to use any of the joint venture entities to issue 
the guarantee because of the complexities of their ownership structures.  You 
also wouldn't want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate 
issues.  By process of elimination, I guess I'm OK with NN issuing the 
guarantee.  In my view, if Mavrix' commercial strategies are unsuccessful and 
Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those 
dollars in Northern's next rate case.  Thanks.  DF

Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp., which is a subsidiary of ETS, needs to 
satisfy TW's creditworthiness requirements in order to enter into a 
transportation agreement with TW.  Paul Cherry has suggested that Northern 
Natural Gas issue a guarantee.  Please let me know whether you think this 
would be acceptable.  If Mavrix wanted to hold NNG capacity, TW could issue 
the guarantee.

Late Wednesday, FERC issued a notice scheduling the Staff Conference focusing 
on pipeline affiliate issues.  The roundtable conference will take place on 
Wednesday, January 31 at 1:00 p.m. (note that FERC does not intend for this 
to be an all-day conference).  Preliminary comments and requests to 
participate are due by January 5, 2001.  [There is an INGAA Regulatory Policy 
Committee meeting this Thursday, November 30, in Washington, DC, in which the 
pipelines' approach to this conference will be discussed and organized.  
Shelley Corman is Chair of that committee.}

The purpose of the conference, as stated in Order No. 637, is to discuss how 
changes in the natural gas market may impact the Commission's regulation of 
pipelines and their affiliates and non-affiliates, as well as capacity 
holders and their affiliates, capacity managers and agents.  The conference 
is structured as a roundtable debate with no opening remarks from 
participants, though Staff requests parties to "provide input on how to 
structure the discussion."  Over the past month or so, Staff has spoken with 
industry representatives on the structure of this conference, aware that the 
subject matter lends itself to the possibility of an unproductive grudge 
match among industry sectors.  Staff is requesting comments before the 
roundtable to inform the structure and substance of the roundtable as led by 
Staff.

The notice asks that parties submit written comments by January 5th to 
identify issues and examples to foster a meaningful dialog and to suggest 
questions the Staff moderator may wish to pose to the panel.  Comments should 
include a one-page single spaced position summary and whether the commentor 
is interested in participating in the roundtable.  Like-minded entities are 
encouraged to select one spokesperson (ie, pipelines, LDCs, producers).

The broad question in the notice is whether the current standards of conduct 
need to be eliminated, expanded or modified based on the changing nature of 
the industry, and whether there should be uniform standards for all holders 
of pipeline capacity, or do distinctions need to be made in the treatment of 
affiliate relationships (and ownership rules) between the gas and electric 
industries.

The notice also delineates some specific areas of concern for comment.  
Boiling them down to the main questions, these are:

(1) Current Regulatory Approach:  Are current standards effective; discuss 
successful or unsuccessful experiences; do current reporting mechanisms allow 
for effective affiliate market activity monitoring?

(2) Potential Concerns:  Whether and when do affiliate transactions pose the 
potential for anticompetitive or discriminatory effects, or explain why such 
effects are not likely?  PROVIDE EXAMPLES OR SCENARIOS.  Do different types 
of affiliates (LDC, gas/power marketer, power gen, asset manager) pose 
different risks?  What are the effects of the changing market conditions, and 
is there potential for market or consumer benefits from affiliate 
transactions? 

(3) Potential Approaches:  Are there better methods to regulate affiliate 
transactions beyond the standards of conduct and reporting requirements?  
What are costs and potential adverse impacts of the following possible 
alternatives: open and fair bidding procedures; prohibitions on affiliates 
holding capacity on affiliated pipelines; limits on affiliate capacity market 
share; changes to open-season bidding to break-up large capacity packages; 
divestiture of affiliates.  "Similar approaches could be considered for 
affiliates of non-pipeline capacity holders."   Comment on the following 
possible adverse impacts of such alternatives: risk of unsubscribed capacity; 
potential cost shifts; lack of affiliate contracts to underpin new 
construction projects.

The full FERC notice (PL00-1-000, November 22, 2000) is attached here.

As you may recall we have been arguing with the MN Dept. of Revenue for years 
over whether or not natural gas used as a compressor fuel was subject to the 
Minnesota use tax.  Great Lakes has been in court with the DOR over this same 
issue.  Today I received the following, which is an internal memo that was 
circulated in the Dorsey & Whitney law firm, which has been representing 
Great Lakes announcing a favorable ruling.

If the cost savings are worth a little bit of hassle, we can do this.  We'll 
need to make a FERC filing by the end of the 1st Q 2000 to identify the 
"shared facilities."  Also, if you decide to go forward, don't do it until 
1-1-2000 so we don't have to scramble to get the info in front of FERC this 
quarter.  Let me and Maria know what you decide to do and we'll arrange a 
briefing on the specific rules to be aware of and we'll make sure we 
understand the situation fully so we can properly disclose to FERC what is 
up.  Please call with any questions. Thanks.  DF

EES is a marketing affiliate, so we do need to be careful about shared

able to do it, otherwise, the hassles and expense of building marketing

I need you guys to jump back into your files on the Topock issue asap.  Tony, 
I assume Lou briefed you on the situation.  I think the most recent liquids 
sample had pcbs in excess of 50 ppm.  That is well in excess of the 
contractual limit that I recall to be 1 ppm.  Our research a few months ago 
was about options to force the interconnect back open above 250 mm/d if the 
samples came back clean.  Now, the issue is, given dirty samples, what can we 
do to keep PGE from slamming the interconnect shut.  We need to complete our 
research/thinking immediately and have a spectrum of options ready to 
discuss.  Seriously, I am reviewing with Lou the option of a preemptive shut 
down of the interconnect, but that looks like an unwise strategy so far.  ALL 
ideas are worth considering.  Frank, Steve, and Maria, anything in your 
memory banks on TW or FERC jurisprudence that would prevent a Hinshaw from 
refusing to schedule transport volumes through a point even if the Hinshaw 
seemed to have clear contractual rights to refuse to schedule volumes based 
on gas quality/contamination concerns?  I don't think TW's tariff has a 
specific PCB spec.   DF

Warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the foc=
us=20
in the
gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growi=
ng=20
sense
that supplies might just prove adequate. The result has been a steady and=
=20
steep
decline in the November NYMEX price from $5.63 per MMBtu on October 12 into
the $4.60s as of October 25. Cash prices have followed suit, falling from t=
he=20
mid-
$5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub, and gas is now pricing below residua=
l=20
fuel oil
in the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20
inventories
will begin the winter at levels higher than expected, in CERA=01,s view ade=
quate
supply for the winter is not yet assured, and the market remains subject to=
 a=20
quick
return to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap.

Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe=
r=20
20
accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif=
t=20
in
market psychology. Last week=01,s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf, or approxima=
tely=20
3.8
Bcf per day, above the previous five-year average for those seven days and =
58=20
Bcf
above the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob=
er=20
22.
With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20
expected
next week, CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2,784 Bcf o=
n
October 31--still an all-time low entering the winter, by 26 Bcf (see Table=
=20
1).

Is this inventory level "enough"? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter=
=20
under 15-
year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf, 22 Bcf=
=20
above
the previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20
withdrawals in
the United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 128 Bcf abo=
ve=20
last year=01,s
withdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac=
e=20
of a
return to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul=
d
bring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound and
growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20
winter,
holding withdrawals down requires both of the following:

* Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol
producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices
must remain shut down. These markets represent
approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return,
should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol.

* The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning
residual fuel oil must remain off of gas.

In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,=
=20
particularly
as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20
demand can
be met, the current resid load can return to gas, and storage inventories c=
an=20
be held
reasonably near the previous record low. That low, 758 Bcf, occurred in Mar=
ch=20
1996
and was accompanied by a February average price of $4.41 and a March averag=
e=20
of
$3.00 at the Henry Hub. That spring, however, US productive capability was=

nearly
4.0 Bcf per day greater than it is today, winter power generation demand wa=

lower,
and there were about 4.5 million fewer residential and commercial gas=20
customers in
the United States.

Market fundamentals in CERA=01,s view still support gas prices above those =

which as of this writing is pricing in the $4.75-$5.00 per MMBtu range. War=

Mike, here are two draft sets of talking points covering Stan's initial phone 
call with Ted Davis to discuss whether a settlement meeting would be useful 
and the subsequent settlement meeting itself.  Please give me any comments 
you have and I'll send to Stan or have available to hand to him at our 
meeting, which I understand is scheduled for 9 am on Tuesday.  I'll  be 
calling in from Arizona.  Note there is at least one issue we ought to think 
about a bit more--whether to have Stan imply there may be other goodies 
available other than the Hobbs Line.  I'm inclined to avoid implying that, 
but to have Stan primed to pull out additional goodies if necessary.

I have not yet completed a bullet point outline of the settlement proposal 
for Stan to send to Davis after Stan and he meet.  As things currently stand 
it would basically be identical to the second sheet of talking points.   I 
would prefer to finalize that document after we meet with Stan, both to 
minimize the paper in front of him at the Tuesday meeting and to allow the 
Davis outline to be tailored to reflect the strategy we arrive at with Stan 
(I think I'm safe in assuming we will tinker with the strategy a bit on 
Tuesday morning).  If we do modify the strategy, I'll also modify the talking 
points.  

Britt and Barrett, I wanted you to know the timetable in part because, if 
Stan decides to go forward,  we need to send Barrett's suggested letter to 
Jad verifying continued application of the settlement privilege to Stan and 
Ted's discussions.   I intend to call you after the Stan meeting to advise.  
Just in case you don't hear from me by late morning Tuesday, please give Mike 
a call to confirm whether to send the letter.  I may have fallen into the 
Grand Canyon or been bitten by a hila monster.

Subject: Termination of PG&E agreements

After doing some looking, I've reached the same conclusion as you, Lee:  if 
PG&E fails to comply with our request for assurance of creditworthiness, the 
"Termination" provisions of Section 16.1(b) of our General Terms and 
Conditions will be triggered.  The wording is convoluted, but basically it 
means:

If PG&E fails to perform any obligation under a service agreement, TW may 
terminate the agreement under the following procedure:  1) TW serves written 
notice on PG&E that it is in default, and that TW intends to terminate the 
agreement, 2) PG&E gets 30 days to remedy the default, 3) if PG&E does not 
remedy the default within 30 days, the agreement shall become null and void.

3 issues + my answers:

 1.  Is failure to provide assurance of creditworthiness a breach of the 
service agreement?  I think so -- our Form M Service Agreement expressly 
incorporates the General Terms and Conditions of the tariff, and one of those 
terms and conditions is that shipper must provide satisfactory assurance of 
creditworthiness or TW can terminate service.

 2.  How should Section 16 be read in conjunction with the creditworthiness 
provisions of Section 13?  Section 13 provides that shipper must provide 
satisfactory assurance of creditworthiness within a reasonable periodor TW 
does not have to continue service.  I see nothing in the tariff that would 
prevent us from suspending service to PG&E immediately if they fail to comply 
with our request for assurance of payment within a reasonable time.  
Simultaneously with our suspending service, we should send the letter of 
notice pursuant to Section 16.  

 3.  Is termination of service under Section 13 the equivalent of termination 
of the agreement under Section 16?  I do not believe our suspension of 
service pursuant to Section 13 would result in automatic termination of the 
contract, nor would it allow PG&E to just walk from the contract; it appears 
that either party would have to follow the procedure under Section 16 in 
order to terminate the contract (the notice provisions apply to shipper as 
well as transporter).  Section 13 does not talk about termination of the 
contract, only termination of service.  While I am not satisfied that this is 
crystal clear under our tariff, since it is not expressly stated, I do think 
it is the best answer given the fact that the tariff has, in Section 16, a 
specific procedure for terminating a service agreement.  While there is some 
Texas contract law on implied rescission based on mutual repudiation of the 
contract, I believe our tariff is controlling here because the tariff 
provisions I've cited amount to express contractual provisions between the 
parties governing termination, so there is no reason to go to common law.  
Drew, in answer to your question, our termination of service is not 
anticipatory breach because by definition anticipatory breach is repudiation 
without an excuse.
 
Now for the interesting part.  The Bankruptcy Code provides that a utility 
may not alter, refuse or discontinue service to a debtor solely because of 
commencement of a bankruptcy action or because a debt owed by the debtor was 
not paid when due.  However, the utility may alter, refuse or discontinue 
service if neither the trustee nor the debtor, within 20 days after the date 
of the order for relief, furnished adequate assurance of payment for service 
after such date.  I'm no bankruptcy expert, but my point is simply that our 
rights may change once a bankruptcy action is filed.  The Commission has held 
that termination of service cannot be inconsistent with federal bankruptcy 
law:  see El Paso Natural Gas Company, 61 FERC P61,302 (1992) (involving El 
Paso Electric bankruptcy).

If you need anything else, let me know.

 Under ordinary contract law, we would probably have the right to terminate 
the contract if PG&E is in breach.

Drew, I need to discuss this with you before I fill out the form.  First of 
all it has to be done on-line so I think it is best to do it from your 
machine so I am not the one registered.  Second I need to make your flights 
before I do the form.  We can talk about this on Thursday PM or Friday and 
make the reservations and do the form at that time.

Subject: TW Fuel

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at 
downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to 
tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those 
receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines 
unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that 
make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That 
latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should 
resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell 
it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was 
that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that 
gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement 
(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the 
transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest 
upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when 
ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than 
Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where 
they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling 
that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around 
whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct 
way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt 
points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes 
line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of 
reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move 
to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage 
line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, 
and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. 
border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack 
back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are 
consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line 
pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I 
can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with 
this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK 
with you?  DF

To synthesize what I'm hearing from you and MKM (and Mr. Ni),  our story is 
that we will post for sale an option with a specific MDQ, type (i.e., 
European option or American or whatever), flow period, and points.  For 
example, we'd post  a European call on 10,000/d of Nov. 01--March 02 Permian 
to Topock firm capacity with an exercise date of Jan 1, 2001.  the customer 
would bid an option price and a transport rate.  We'd look at both components 
under a publicly posted evaluation method to decide who wins.  I.e., we may 
post a method saying the winner is the one who pays the highest option fee so 
long as the transport rate bid is above "x".   Seems pretty straightforward, 
and we ought to be able to clarify this adequately in our answer to 
protests.  DF

Subject: Re: TW Options filing  


In our pre-filing discussion, we explained the awarding of call options as 
follows:

Because call options are only sold after we have tried to sell the underlying 
capacity and there were no takers at max. rate or an acceptable price, there 
is really only 1 variable -- the total rate (consisting of the option 
component and the strike price).

The call option is posted for a specific quantity, start date, etc.  There 
are no other variables.  It's just price.

>From our discussions with Mike Coleman and crew on this topic -- I think is 
it absolutely key that we keep the award variables to a minimum.  My take is 
that the transmittal letter referring to highest price is the right way to 
go.  The concept in the tariff about posting the evaluation criteria 
(implying that there are more variables) could kill the deal.

Duke Energy Offers Fixed-Priced Electricity Package for SDG&E
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

Duke Energy, through its business unit Duke Energy North America (DENA),
has submitted an offer to manage San Diego Gas & Electric's (SDG&E) 3,300-M=
W
electricity load. The offer would establish a fixed price of 6 cents per
kilowatt-hour for wholesale power supply for the next five years, based
on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov. 17, 2000. DENA'=
s
proposal, which takes into account SDG&E's seasonal and hourly load=20
requirements
and has a 3-percent annual adjustment for inflation, was included in commen=
ts
submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last week
in response to the commission's proposed remedies for California's electric=
ity
market.

ANALYSIS: As has been well documented in this column and elsewhere, SDG&E
customers witnessed a staggering increase in the price of their electricity
last summer and into this fall, which resulted primarily from an ongoing
imbalance between supply and demand in the state of California. In addition=
,
other contributory factors have included the state's economic growth, lack
of new power plants over the last decade, unstable existing generation,
and the uncertainty of import prospects.

As SDG&E's rate freeze had been lifted last spring, customers of the utilit=
y
were exposed to retail electricity prices that often exceeded 18 cents
per kilowatt-hour, compared to the 6.5 cent per kilowatt hour maximum they
had become accustomed to under the rate freeze. The problem persists as
all three utilities in the state face high wholesale electricity prices.
However, SDG&E customers are as of yet the only ones in the state who bear
the brunt of the high prices as a rate freeze remains in effect for=20
California's
other two IOUs, SCE and PG&E.

DENA is proposing to FERC that it be granted the right to provide power
for the totality of SDG&E's 3,300 MW electricity load. In return, DENA's
proposed fixed rate of 6 cents per kilowatt hour (plus annual 3-percent
increases) presumably will be much lower than the cost SDG&E customers
will continue to face without such a contract. DENA's proposal has been
made possible as a result of FERC's proposed order that was issued last
month, outlining a major overhaul of California's energy market. Since
competition began in the state in the spring of 1998, the three California
IOUs were required to buy their power from the state's Power Exchange.
FERC's order proposes to eliminate the requirement of buying from the PX,
which essentially permits the three IOUs to establish bilateral contracts
with energy suppliers. DENA has seized upon this opportunity to gain a
very lucrative contract, while at the same time attempting to protect SDG&E
customers from exorbitant electricity prices.

So, what is SDG&E's response to DENA's proposal? I spoke with Doug Kline,
spokesperson for the utility, yesterday afternoon. Kline pointed out that,
first of all, SDG&E has not yet received any offer from DENA and that "all
we've seen thus far is a press release." Kline suggested that it was a
public relations strategy on the part of DENA to first submit its proposal
to FERC and that, ultimately, SDG&E would be the one to accept DENA's offer=
.
In order to speak in detail on DENA's proposal, Kline said he would need
to see an actual contract, which has yet to materialize. Kline did disclose
that locking up long-term contracts for SDG&E customers, based on today's
high prices, would have to be seriously questioned by the utility, especial=
ly
considering that new generation will be coming online in California over
the next few years.

Beyond that, SDG&E is fielding other offers from energy suppliers, and
in fact has established long-term contracts with other providers, which
remain unidentified, for 50 percent of the power it buys on the wholesale
market. Back in September, the CPUC granted approval for SDG&E (as well
as SCE and PG&E) to purchase 50 percent of its power in forward markets,
with the other 50 percent still coming from the PX. For SDG&E, this amounts
to 1,900 MW of its total electricity load. Kline said that SDG&E would
need to compare DENA's offer with those received or accepted from other
energy suppliers to know if it represents a good deal for SDG&E customers.


At the same time, Sempra Energy=01*SDG&E's parent company=01*has made its o=
wn
proposal to FERC, urging the federal regulators to order refunds for SDG&E
customers and place a rate cap on wholesale rates, based on generators'
actual fees. Under FERC's proposed order, the commission suggested a "soft
rate cap" of $150/MWh. It's referred to
as "soft" because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid
if they are dispatched, but anything higher than $150/MWh will not set
the price that all generators will receive. Also, any generator setting
a bid above the soft rate cap must report their bid to the Commission,
and presumably fall under intense scrutiny.

This is not the first attempt that DENA has made to, as it says, "fix the
crisis" in California. In fact, back in August DENA offered California
Governor Gray Davis a deal in which the company would deliver 3,000 MW
of new supply to the state through the construction of generation facilitie=
s,
and provide all three IOUs with five-year, fixed-priced supply contracts.
Although Gov. Davis did not finalize a deal that would apply to all three
IOUs, SCE and PG&E proceeded with their own wholesale electricity contracts
with DENA. Both deals were sealed within the last month, although the speci=
fic
prices of the contracts are proprietary.

DENA has also proceeded with building new generation in the state. Just
two weeks ago, the company broke ground on a $525 million modernization
of its Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County. The modernization effor=
t
is projected to add 1,060 MW of new capacity to site's current 1,500 MW
and create the state's largest power plant. DENA claims that, when complete=
d,
the 2,560 MW that the plant will produce will generate enough wholesale
electricity to serve approximately 2.5 million households. In addition,
DENA has pending applications with the California Energy Commission to
modernize and expand two other power plants in California (Morro Bay and
South Bay power plants).

DENA's motivations are pretty understandable. The company may espouse good
intentions of helping California recover from its crisis but, realistically=
,
energy suppliers stand to make an awful lot of money from the state. I
started to notice the trend last month as 3Q earnings were reported. Virtua=
lly
every company that is active in California's wholesale market reported
a significant increase in earnings, reflective of the summer price volatili=
ty.
DENA was no exception. As a whole, Duke Energy reported record 3Q earnings
of $2.08 per share, a 73-percent increase over earnings per share of $1.20
for 3Q 1999. The company's North American Wholesale Energy=01*comprised of
DENA and Duke Energy Merchants=01*posted sharply higher gains with EBIT of
$231 million, a 175-percent increase over 3Q 1999. According to Duke Energy=
's
report, DENA achieved strong performance from its fleet of merchant power
plants and from natural gas and power trading activities.  DENA remains
on schedule to deliver approximately 3,200 megawatts of new merchant=20
generation
(nationally) in time for summer 2001.

Moreover, it is as of yet unknown whether or not DENA's offer truly benefit=
s
SDG&E and its customers. The proposal certainly benefits DENA, however,
especially if the company can lock in a contract that is based on current
high prices and includes annual increases. Securing SDG&E customers under
these factors would be a major coup for DENA in the California market,
but how it stacks up against SDG&E's other unnamed offers remains to be
seen.

Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A 
consent agreement has been filed with the 
FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process 
prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas
assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd 
quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting 
some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated 
they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP.

El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake

El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d 
line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last 
week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would 
result in a $20 million loss. 

The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha 
market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link 
between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal 
route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. 

Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of 
compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. 

Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own 
stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm 
transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. 

Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal 
Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General.

Subject: Pueblo

Tino called this morning with a quick report.  They are still negotiating 
with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.  The size of the 
plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.  Tino has been 
ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls 
apart.  He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it 
related to the pipeline right of way.  The have a binding 20 year agreement 
with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly 
payment.  I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the 
ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  The question is whether we 
are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis 
has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  I 
told Tino I'd give him a call next week to let him know.  At minimum, I'd 
suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they've got and 
advise us on what its worth.  Your thoughts?  DF

Subject: Summer Intern

I received a resume from a Creighton Law School student (will graduate May, 
2001) requesting an internship in either marketing, regulatory or legal.  
Prior to entering law school, he worked as an assistant to the General 
Counsel of Duke Energy in Denver  (from May, 1997 - August, 1998) where he 
became  familiar with some of the regulatory/legal aspects of the natural gas 
transportation and processing industry.  He indicates that he is particularly 
interested in gaining knowledge regarding compliance with FERC regulatory 
requirements and interstate pipeline tariffs.  He's done paralegal work for 
several attorneys in the Denver area since April, 1996 and while attending 
the Denver Paralegal Institute (ABA Paralegal Certificate received in June, 
1996).  He also has a BA in History/Political Science from Jamestown College 
in Jamestown, ND, in 1995.

It's not often that we have an opportunity to bring in an intern with some 
experience in the industry.   Please let me know if you are interested in 
reviewing his resume and can find some meaningful work for him this summer.

Note:  This interview with Jack Crawford of Alliance is probably the best 
information we have gained on the pipeline
operational start up and background information.  Vector may still be "iffy" 
for Dec. 1.  

Fingers Crossed, Alliance, Vector Shoot for Dec. 1
 
Alliance Pipeline informed its shippers yesterday that all debris has been 
cleared from the pipe, all connections are up and running, and that 
commercial service will begin on Dec. 1. Commercial service originally was 
expected to begin on Oct. 1 but was delayed several times because of 
commissioning problems . 

"We've tested all of our connections and we've been flowing volumes [to 
Midwestern LDCs] up to about half [663 MMcf/d] of what the pipeline is 
capable of transporting," said Alliance spokesman Jack Crawford. 

"We are asking our shippers today to provide forecasts to us of what they 
expect to do in the first month. The last time we did this the forecasts we 
got suggested that we'd be running at about 1.325 Bcf on the first day." 

One of the key questions remaining is whether Alliance's main downstream 
supply outlet, the 270-mile Vector Pipeline project, will be ready to go as 
well on Dec. 1. Vector had construction problems because of wet weather and 
also was forced to delay its start-up from Nov. 1.  The pipeline would 
transport 700 MMcf/d of gas initially from Joliet, IL, through Indiana and 
Michigan to Dawn, ON, but would be expanded to 1 Bcf/d next November. 

"The last I heard they were expecting to make [the deadline]," said Crawford. 
"We actually tested our meter with them over the weekend and it's all up and 
running, but that might be a subsequent event if they have a problem. It's 
been a challenge for them to get going, but it looks like they are all ready 
to go." 

A Vector spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly and 
operations appear to be on schedule for Dec. 1 start-up. "Right now everybody 
still feels that Dec. 1 is doable," he said. "You might want to touch base 
again next week and see how it looks, but right now it looks like we're 
getting things pretty well wrapped up. 

"The last place where we've been completing work has been up in the Milford 
and Highland Townships in Oakland County, MI. That's the area just before we 
go in the portion of the pipeline that we're leasing from Michigan 
Consolidated Gas Co. As of last Friday, they still hadn't reached that area 
with linepack [gas]." 

Crawford said the Aux Sable liquids plant also is up and running, and 
previous pipeline coordination difficulties have been ironed out. "They are 
still bringing it up to full scale. They are short both volume and heat 
content at the moment and that's by design. The pipeline is flowing at about 
half volume at the moment, and in addition to that we've been running lean 
test gas." 

Farther upstream, Alliance still has one lateral, the Peace River Lateral, 
that will be delayed because of the impact of wet summer weather on 
construction. "It will be up and running perhaps not by Dec. 1 but in a week 
or two. It's an eight and 10-inch line. It's relatively small," he said. 

Once the massive new pipeline is running smoothly, the next steps to be taken 
include potential connections with several proposed pipelines in and around 
Chicago, including potentially the Guardian, Horizon and Whitecap Energy 
projects. 

"We also looked at a couple of other receipt connections on the upstream 
side," said Crawford. "We've obviously talked about a potential expansion in 
the future, but as we found out by talking to people it looks like the supply 
additions in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin have not been as brisk as 
we might have thought, probably because of the downturn in the oil price a 
couple of years ago. It's likely that an expansion would be delayed for a 
year or two or even three. 

"The best that I've been able to ascertain from talking to people is that our 
supply deliverability really has not increased very much in the last two to 
three years, and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our 
system will end up coming out of other systems." 

He also mentioned that TransCanada is planning to take some of its capacity 
out of service, including retiring some older compressors and rewheeling 
others, in order to reduce the amount of excess pipeline capacity in the 
Canadian gas market.

Thanks Bob.  I'm out sick today (my wife made me stay home until I quit 
griping about a sore throat I can't seem to shake), but I forwarded your 
voicemail on item 3 to Kent yesterday.  I'll forward this to him as a 
reminder.  ON the other two items, I'll send you separate emails on each.  DF

Subject: ET&S 2nd Quarter Earnings

As you know we have been developing a list of possible earnings items to be 
moved out of 2nd quarter.  The list now totals $7.5MM and has been approved 
by Stan and Rod.  We're now in the "make it happen" stage.

We have 3 items that we'll need your assistance with:

Increasing the Conoco litigation reserve from $1.0mm that we now have on the 
books to a new balance of $3.0MM -- a $2MM increase.  To accomplish this we 
need a memo from you to request and support the increase.  The fact that we 
laid $3MM cash on the settlement table is good.  It you mention that it was 
$3MM plus Hobbs 12" line, then please qualify that with an indication that 
the market value of that line is de minimus.

Increasing the accrual for the Duke/Coyanosa obligation from $600,000 to 
$800,000.  I'm not sure what the basis for this increase is (continuing cost 
incurrence?), but your help in supporting the increase is solicited.

Need a copy of the SBA Transaction Fee agreement with TransCanada Energy 
Marketing so that we can accrue (and expense) the obligation in June 
(assuming it's not payable until July).  As we discussed earlier this week, 
we also need this document for AA's final review of base gas sale documents.

Subject: Temporary Housing

Hello Drew, I wanted to touch base with you regarding your temporary housing 
situation.  Deb Cappiello called me this morning and informed me that the 
Marketing apartment is fully available to you starting on Monday, March 26.  
Deb mentioned that they would still receive the invoices in Omaha, but could 
code the invoice to a Legal cost center if you decided to go with this 
apartment.  

Debra Kallus in the relocation department is available any time to discuss 
alternative temporary housing with you as well.  She has offered to have a 
representative personally show you corporate housing close to downtown if you 
are interested.  Let me know if we need to proceed with Debra further or go 
with the Marketing apartment.  My extension is 3-6609 and cell number 
713-410-3058 if you would like to discuss.  Thanks.

Subject: Re: SSL Abandonment - Sale to El Paso  

I had a meeting with El Paso the afternoon of Nov. 6th to discuss the 
abandonment, and the "next steps"

El Paso agrees to shoot for a November 30, 2000 close, with them assuming 
commercial and revenue responsibility on December 1st.  I requested funds 
transfer to NNG on the first business day of Jan 2001.

All exhibits to the P&SA are collected and being made available to legal for 
incorporation into closing documents.  These include MMS ROW's, space lease 
agreements on  three platforms, and a surviving NNG/Sea Gull transport 
agreement.

Robert Newman with EGC has contacted El Paso field operations and they have 
developed a list of information operations will transfer to El Paso regarding 
pipeline Ass Builts, maintenance information,. metering activity, MMS safety 
inspections, corrosion control, leak histories, etc.

Preliminary worksheet showing the "Adjusted Price" was developed and agreed 
to with El Paso.  Estimate of proceeds at the time of closing will be 
$1,357,107.00.  This was developed using estimates for the last three months 
revenue stream, and four month of O&M.  The final number will be developed 
and routed internally once actual variable are known.  Due to the transition 
to SAP, queries be expense code are more difficult to obtain.

If you should have any questions or need any information please let me know.

Thanks, Bob

Subject: Extensions of cap rel contracts

Attached please find 2 draft letter to send to acquiring shippers with copies 
to releaseing shippers.

Letter A is to go to those shippers that have not paid the November 
invoices.  Pursuant to the tariff, Northern can give notice to terminate the 
service agreement.  At such point, the service agreement reverts back to the 
releasing shipper.The letter includes a notice that we consider the agreement 
extended to 2003 per the rate case even without their execution.

Letter B is to go to those acquiring shippers that paid the November 
invoices.  For those service agreement with an original expiration date of 
10/31/99, the payment constitutes acknowledgement that the agreement 
continues to 2002 pursuant to the administrative amendment that extended the 
agreement pursuant to the rollover provisions.  The letter includes a notice 
that we consider the agreement extended to 2003 per the rate case even 
without their execution.

Do we want to add to both letters that if the amendment is not executed, 
Northern will consider the releases temporary and the entitlement will revert 
back to the releasing shipper by x date?  or do we want to just wait until 
11/1/02 and see what happens.  (the revert back maybe should be in a separate 
letter to the Releasing Shipper otherwise the acquiring shipper will just do 
nothing and we'll be fighting with the releasing shipper anyway.  I'm 
rambling but hopefully you get the jist. 

Please let me have your comments ASAP because I don't know when 30 days from 
the invoice runs out.  Considering they have ten days to pay and we know they 
haven;t paid, we for sure only have 20 days.  Thanks, Dari

it is not a video conference room.  If you want to meet in an office or

MEMORANDUM

TO:???? ??????? Regulatory Policy Commission 
FROM:?? Joan Dreskin 
DATE:?? ??????? January 31, 2001 
RE:???? ??????? Request to intervene and reply to Indicated Shipper and 
Dynegy's Request for Rehearing, Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., Docket No. 
CP95-218-003.

??????? On January 16, Indicated Shippers and Dynegy took rehearing of the 
Texas Eastern order that held that pipelines do not need preapproval from 
FERC to acquire capacity on other pipelines.? Indicated Shippers and Dynegy 
took rehearing on the following grounds: (1) The Commission order is 
procedurally defective in that it repeals a Commission regulation, 18 CFR o 
284.242, without following a notice and comment rulemaking procedures; (2) 
The old Texas Eastern policy has been effective, and has deterred the conduct 
it was intended to preclude; (3) The Commission order ignores crucial "rate 
impacts" associated with off-system capacity acquisition; and (4) The 
Commission's references to the ability of a pipeline acquiring offsystem 
capacity to release that capacity under the acquiring pipeline's tariff are 
unclear.

??????? Although the Commission's regulations do not provide for answers to 
rehearing requests, Dominion and Duke have asked that we intervene and 
respond to Indicated Shippers and Dynegy's request for rehearing in order to 
help the Commission formulate its decision.? As you may remember from INGAA's 
marketing affiliate comments, the Commission's December 14 order has a lot of 
excellent language in it, such as statements that holding offsystem capacity 
does not favor marketing affiliates, that INGAA wants to support.

??????? If Chairman Hebert wishes to keep his promise to do away with tolling 
orders, this rehearing would need to be acted on by Wednesday February 14, 
2001.? Accordingly, if INGAA wishes to be heard it must do so quickly.

??????? Please let me know by COB tomorrow whether you support INGAA 
responding to Indicated Shippers and Dynegy's request for rehearing.? If you 
agree, then I will proceed to get our Board of Directors' approval.

Drew,
Here's a chance to wear your honorary Marketing beanie.  If you read the no=
te=20
below, we're engaged in very preliminary conversations with PEMEX with the=
=20
idea that maybe TW/NNG could offer a viable alternative to EPNG to move gas=
=20
into Mexico through the Samalayuca lateral (commencement point located=20
approx. 50 miles east of the city of El Paso).  New construction would=20
involve approx. 150 miles of pipeline and associated compression to tie int=
o=20
the existing TW/NNG systems near Waha.  Notwithstanding PEMEX's desire to=
=20
move off EPNG for a portion of the load, I don't think the economics will=
=20
work.=20

However, KN Energy (now Kinder) used to own a line they acquired through=20
Westar (they acquired it from El Paso Products Co.) that runs from Waha=20
westward to a point near the city of El Paso.  It's primarily a 20" line, a=
nd=20
it currently serves El Paso Electric Co. and several directly connected=20
industrial customers.  As a KN operation, it typically didn't run full.  I=
=20
see the acquisition of this line as one possible way we could serve both th=
e=20
existing markets as well as incremental volumes to PEMEX at a rate that mig=
ht=20
work for them.  I completely spaced on the fact that Kinder sold many of it=
s=20
south system assets (including this West Texas line) to Oneok last year.  I=
f=20
we are to pursue this idea, then we're forced to dealing with Oneok.

I know that we're in deep dog poo with Oneok right now regarding Bushton.  =
My=20
question is, are we in any kind of position to talk to Oneok about this=20
asset, considering  the legal status of our dispute at Bushton?  Also, does=
=20
our desire (potentially) to own this asset create any kind of negotiating=
=20
currency with Oneok on the Bushton issue?

I'd appreciate your thoughts.  We're due to have Pemex in our offices next=
=20
week.   Thanks!

Jeff,

As we talk this morning we are interested on developing a new project
with your company that could take gas into EPNG=01,s Hueco compressor
station located in Hudspeth County, Texas.

The preliminary information we can give you in order to move forward
with the project is this:

Receipt point:                            Transwestern and NNG
Delivery point-                            Hueco Compress Station
Delivery Pressure-                      840 psi
Volume                                     100,150 and 200 MMBTU/day
Term                                         10,15 and 20 years.


The information we would like to receive from you is:

1.         Permissions you will need to get in order to build the
interconnection FERC, RRC, EPNG, others (timing for those permissions)
2.         Time to build the interconnection
3.         As we understand, you as interstate pipeline need to post the
capacity at the EBB, how much time would it take?
4.         Rates and fuel charges that apply for all your system
(Transwestern and NNG)
5.         Estimated cost for the new interconnection facilities.
6.         Supply areas that we can access
7.         Storage Facilities


We hope that with this information you can run your first numbers about
how we can make this project work and we can have some distance walked
for our upcoming meeting on march 9th, 2001

Thank you in advance for the help and if you have any question don=01,t
hesitate to give me a call.

Sincerely yours=01(

Please plan to attend an in-house training session on an "Introduction to the 
Electric Industry."   Jim Crist, a lecturer with IGT  is preparing a day-long 
seminar customized to our interests and issues.   

Here is my "top 4 list" on why GPG staff need to increase our understanding 
of the electric industry.

First and foremost, gas-fired electric generation is the growth market for 
gas pipelines.  We need to get a sense of why and where generation is being 
built and who the likely customers are.  This involves understanding the 
different between utility generation and merchant plants, the dynamics of 
siting, understanding a little bit about how utilities plan and economically 
justify generation investments.
Second, we need to understand electric utilities as customers.  Who is the 
customer these days -- the generator?  Who should we be dealing with within 
the utility organization.  What types of load patterns should we expect 
various types of electric players?  What types of services do they need?  We 
also need to get a sense of how the timing of their processes 
compare/contrast to our processes on the gas side.
Third, we need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and 
the implications for electric generation demand growth.  We need to 
understand the state/federal jurisdictional issues.  We need to learn about 
the debates over ATC, TLR, locational marginal pricing, price caps, and 
control areas.  We need to understand how these issues fit into Enron's 
position in support of restructuring the electric industry, unbundling 
transmission, removing native load exceptions, and avoiding prices caps and 
we need to understand how these debates affect GPG.
 Fourth, we need to understand electric tariffs and practices, services and 
OASIS because the FERC has started to insist on common rules between gas and 
electric.  The recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on 
the gas side.  FERC is talking about imposing the RTO principles on 
pipelines. And, we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipeline 
EBBs.  We want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices 
where it makes sense and on the flip side, know how to argue against the 
imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate 
differences between gas and electric.

I've shared this list of interests with Jim Crist as he prepares a customized 
seminar for us.  Please feel free to email me with any other areas of 
interest for the course.   I will keep you posted on the specific location as 
things progress.  In the meantime, please make sure to save the date!   
Please pass this notice along to others in your organization that may be 
interested.

Subject: LRC Joint Venture

Please find the attached memo summarizing a proposed joint venture between 
Enron North America and Texaco involving our respective intrastate pipeline 
assets in Louisiana (i.e., Enron's LRC pipeline).  The joint venture would 
restrict Enron and its affiliates from pursuing certain limited business 
opportunities involving specified pipeline assets that may be competitive 
with the joint venture.  Specifically, these assets include: 

(i) the Acadian Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
Petroleum Inc. USA), 
(ii) the Cypress Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
Petroleum Inc. USA), 
(iii) the Louisiana Intrastate Gas System (currently ultimately owned by 
American Electric Power Co. Inc.), 
(iv) the Louisiana Gas System (currently ultimately owned by Conoco Inc.); 
and 
(v) the Louisiana gas pipeline assets of Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. (currently 
ultimately owned by Koch Industries).  

In keeping with Enron's internal policies, we are seeking your confirmation 
that you have no objection to the non-compete provisions in this 
transaction.  Please feel free to call Lance Schuler, Hal Bertram or me if 
you have any questions.

Regards,
Brian

As we discussed, based on this email and the other information you have given 
me, I have significant concerns about our ability to use the ENA products 
discussed below.  Having ENA IT people involved on an ongoing basis in 
maintaining the software and assisting us in using it would probably 
constitute a violation of the marketing affiliate rules or would at minimum 
create the appearance of marketing affiliate violations.  As I understand the 
risk books, etc., confidential information on our various capacity positions 
would be all over the place and difficult or impossible to firewall off from 
ENA people working on those books.  If there is some firewall strategy that 
the ENA folks have in mind, i.e., if those IT people are or will be employed 
by Networks or Corp., I am eager to listen, but from what I have learned so 
far, I am not comfortable with our use of the ENA system.  DF

Subject: Risk System Alternatives Next Steps

Lee,
Just to recap the meeting with Richard Burchfield and Steve Stock, based on 
the requirements that you and Vernon have identified, we would need to use 
several of the system components including TAG, ERMS, GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, 
CREDIT, and UNIFY for settlements.  All of these applications are tightly 
integrated.  We considered moving them into the ETS environment which would 
separate the applications, but this would be a very large undertaking and 
would be a resource intensive effort.  Therefore, due to the size, complexity 
and integration of the applications, the group came to the conclusion that it 
would be more timely and cost effective from an inception as well as 
maintenance standpoint that ETS would have to share these systems with the 
marketing group, and that porting them to the ETS environment as separate 
application images would not be good from an overall migration as well as 
support standpoint.  Additionally, we considered the EnPower System which is 
also integrated into GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, CREDIT and UNIFY.  We are planning 
on a demo Friday morning, but there may be some functionality that you all 
are looking for related to gas that EnPower cannot provide at this time and 
would require some customization.  We'll know more tomorrow after the demo.

Regarding security, these applications are secured to segregate the data, but 
we need an approval from Legal that it would be ok to use shared resources 
from the IT standpoint.  This would include application developers and 
database administrators.  Additionally, we would have to go through the 
process of verifying that there would be no security leaks where it would be 
possible for a marketer to run a report on pipeline related data, etc...  If 
we can get an ok from Legal regardinig sharing of resources, then one of 
these options can be explored further, but if we cannot get approval on 
sharing of resources, it doesn't look like porting either of these 
applications into the ETS environment as standalone apps would be the most 
timely or cost effective way to go at this time.  Can you get a stand from 
Legal regarding this issue?  Thanks.

You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but 
there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we 
left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection 
is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement 
signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later.  
Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk 
and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On 
my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate 
Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement.  

Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective 
files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done 
with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF

Lon, thanks for including me on the following distribution.  Both Greek Rice 
and I have received phone calls from the Coastal (Great Lakes) corporate 
legal officer informing us of the outcome on the day of the decision.  He 
expects the State to appeal, and we will be watching this very closely.

We have had a series of meetings with the Minn DOR on behalf of NNG, 
discussing not only the compressor fuel issue but the Industrial Processing 
tactic in general, and were on hold by the DOR until this case with Great 
Lakes was decided.  

If you would like to have further details, please let me know and we will be 
gald to furnish them to you.

Thanks again.

As you may recall we have been arguing with the MN Dept. of Revenue for years 
over whether or not natural gas used as a compressor fuel was subject to the 
Minnesota use tax.  Great Lakes has been in court with the DOR over this same 
issue.  Today I received the following, which is an internal memo that was 
circulated in the Dorsey & Whitney law firm, which has been representing 
Great Lakes announcing a favorable ruling.

Subject: Status Conference before Judge Downes


There was a lengthy status conference this afternoon, lasting about an hour
and a quarter.  It was marred by extremely poor telephone connections.  The
technical difficulties frustrated the parties and the judge and made the
conference a mess.

Without trying to summarize the conference, I note a few things that the
Court decided to do based on the discussions.


1.   Quinque.  Judge Downes agreed to have oral argument on the motion to
remand in Quinque on January 3, 2001 at 1:15 p.m. in Casper.  One hour was
set aside for argument.  He declined Mike Beatty's suggestion of an
additional executive summary of the briefing.  The judge was the first one
to suggest the oral argument.  The plaintiffs suggested that the Court rule
on the papers, but quickly acquiesced to the Court's suggestion when the
defendants said that they wanted argument.

2.    Osterhoudt.   Osterhoudt appeared pro se.  Motion to disqualify
Wright's counsel (Phillips & Cohen) and estopping Mr. Wright on some claims.
Both Osterhoudt and Wright want oral argument.  Wright defendants and DOJ
didn't object.  Osterhoudt was appearing pro se, and so there was a long
rambling discussion of the matter.  The judge was reluctant to cut off a pro
se party, but ultimately did.  Regrettably, the rambling discussion set the
tone for the rest of the call.

3.   Osterhoudt.   Government's motion to dismiss Ousterhoudt's case.
Government wants its motion to dismiss Grynberg's valuation claims to be
heard at the same time.  The government claims these relator status issues
are holding up the Shell $56 million settlement and any future settlements.
Grynberg objected to having the motion in Grynberg heard at the same time.
Grynberg wants discovery from Wright and the government.

4.    Pending Motions.  The Court, of out frustration at the inability to
hear the parties and at the attempts by some to argue the merits of things
that the Court was not prepared to address, set down two hours for oral
argument on February 22, 2001, at 10:00 a.m. on all pending  motions in
Wright and Grynberg that address the jurisdictional issues discussed on the
call and the motions to dismiss.  This obviously will create some problems.
It was far from clear precisely which motions that the Court had in mind.
While there are not that many motions pending, some of the pending
government motions likely could affect public disclosure / original source
motions that the defendants could, but have not yet, filed.  The defendants
have not filed those motions yet because of a desire to first test the
complaints on Rule 9(b) grounds.

5.   Discovery.   Parties who want discovery on those issues (Grynberg and
probably the Wright defendants) were given one day to present their position
by letter to the Court.  Other parties then will have two days to respond.

6.    Liaison Counsel.   The Court designated Tom Nicholas as Liaison
Counsel for the defendants in the Wright case and Don Schultz as Liaison
Counsel for the defendants in the Quinque case.

7.    February 22 hearing.  Phil Figa, one of Grynberg's lawyers, was given
the task of leading the consultation among counsel concerning how the
pending motions should be addressed at the hearing and how the time should
be divided.

Keith, I believe our strategy is that unless FERC acts negatively on our 
motion (i.e., orders us to comply), we are just not going to file anything.  
MKM and DF, please let me know if I am out of line here.  

I will work on our request for rehearing and try to get a draft to everyone 
by Thursday (want Fawcett's input on competitive harm and he will not be back 
in the office until Wed.).  It's not due until 30 days out, but why not get 
it ready to go early.

Susan, have we been granted the extension for filing the discounts?  I did 
not see anything on RIMS this morning.  If not, does Donna need to have

Here is the draft letter agreement.  We are still discussing it with ECS and 
can make whatever changes are appropriate.  Note that the letter agreement 
ties back to Article 6 of the Compression Services Agreement.  That article, 
you may recall, is where ECS agreed to create a computerized system that 
would monitor Continental Divide's electric system utilization and warn when 
their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor 
offline (subject to manual override) so we and ECS could avoid peak period 
demand charges.  Instead of creating such a system, which apparently turned 
out to be mostly a manual system anyway, ECS is going to pay us a monthly fee 
to monitor CD's system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off 
line.  The load management service has to do with operational management of 
the load we place on CD's electric system, and is not a jurisdictional gas 
transportation or storage service.  Note that the service goes on for 10 
years (as required by the accountants' 10 year amortization rule) and thus 
may be vulnerable to scrutiny and potential revenue crediting in TW's 2007 
rate case.  Any way to avoid that?  DF

Attached below is my approval of a bunch of capacity packages for sale on 
EOL.  As you can see, I think there is an important issue of contract 
language that we need to resolve at some point if we are going to get maximum 
mileage out of EOL.  Please let me know what you think we ought to do about 
this--in my view, if we are going to sell long term capacity on a discounted 
basis, we ought to keep using the language we have historically used on what 
happens if our max rates are reduced and what happens if our rate design is 
modified.  As to the old confidentiality paragraph and some of the other 
stuff, I'm not sure it is worth keeping and running the risk of FERC finding 
that we have overreached (i.e., the paragraph saying a customer can't ever 
challenge our discount adjustment).   Lets talk.  df

Subject: Re: EOL Routing/Approval - Urgent  

I am OK on selling these packages on EOL.  This approval is based on my 
understanding that all of this capacity is currently posted, or, if not 
currently posted, will be posted for the appropriate amount of time prior to 
sale.  Additionally, this approval is contingent on use of the webtext we 
have been using for other EOL deals (I feel the need to say the obvious 
because I don't believe Law will see anything on these packages again).  I 
also assume that these will be short term deals--i.e., less than one year.  
Any long term discounted deals raise concerns that our "standard discount 
language" is designed to address, such as what is the effect of a new rate 
design or reduction in the max rate on the discounted deal.  I think we can 
live without that language in short term deals for now, but we need to 
revisit this issue and come up with a solution before we sell any long term 
deals on EOL.  ONe last thing, it is marketing's decision whether to include 
in the webtext the provision that says Northern gets the $$ if the shipper 
releases the capacity at a rate higher than the discounted rate.  I think our 
approach in negotiated deals has been to get that agreement if we could (a 
basis run up could make it a very valuable right).  If you have any 
questions, call me.  DF

click your reply button and note same.

Is Grounding a Substitute for Surge Suppression Protection?

One of the most common questions regarding Surge Suppression is whether it
is necessary when a grounding system exists. Proper grounding is necessary
for the Instrumentation and Automation systems in use today, but is no
substitute for Surge Suppression equipment in preventing electrical system
damage. Grounding should only be part of the strategy in preventing
equipment damage from electrical surges.

An electrical surge is a burst of voltage that lasts only a matter of
microseconds but which generates very large amounts of current, and this
current must be diverted away from the electrical equipment to be protected.
Some people hold the opinion that if a grounding system is installed, the
electrical system voltage will rise together and lower together and that no
damage to the equipment will occur. While this could be true in theory, the
reality is that very few installations are isolated from other voltages. For
example, the addition of computers with modems or network cards introduces
another ground into the system.

If the two buildings are separated electrically, then the possibility of
damage is minimized, but it is more likely that modems or data lines
interconnect the buildings. A typical scenario might be:

 A lightning strike in the vicinity of one building increases the
 ground potential to 200KV.

 The resistance of the ground decreases this voltage to 15KV
 by the time it gets to the ground circuit of that building.

 As the voltage decreases over the distance to the adjacent
 building, it has lowered to 3KV, with a resulting difference
 of 12KV.

In such a case, the voltage difference between the two buildings generates a
surge current large enough to destroy the communication lines between the
two buildings, and no grounding system can prevent the damage to the
communication ports of the computers. Similarly, any instruments mounted
outdoors can have the same type of voltage difference from the control panel
to which they are connected.

Therefore, while good grounding is essential, it will not neutralize the
potential damage to equipment and processes caused by a surge event.

Subject: Risk Management Policy

We will meet on 9/18/00 at 2:00 pm in 4262 to discuss Risk Management Policy.

Lee, if you and your staff would like to come, please join in on the fun.

Tony has agreed to move the Policy forward to the next level.  I summarize 
some of the key information below.

The current policy is too restrictive.

We need to better define the type of transactions and who has authority to 
execute and manage. 

Do not include procedures and only discuss policy much like the Corporate 
Risk Management Policy.

Positions will be managed in a portfolio of Gas Commodity positions, however 
not all positions are included in the position limits measurement for this 
policy.  For example the pipelines are long capacity and this can be managed 
in a portfolio without a limit requirement.  Also, TW is long over-retained 
gas and this is a position which does not have to be part of our risk 
management limits.  These positions were created by building a pipeline or 
entering into transport service agreements and seperated approval guidelines 
apply.

North American Natural Gas is the only Commodity Group approved.  

Transport Service Agreements are approved in accordance with ET&S policy #1 
and #2.

Financial Risk Management Agreements are approved within the guidelines of 
this policy.  Financial Risk Management Agreements that create risk are 
allowed by the Corporate Policy but not allowed by the ET&S draft policy.  We 
need to think about limits on the creation of risk from Financial Risk 
Management agreements.

The tie in line that TW built is not part of the deal.  We are modifying the 
agreements to make that totally clear and I believe Rockey is going to talk 
to Mary Ann Pearce to make sure there is no misunderstanding.  DF

Thought I would pass this along, I had not heard for sure that this line was 
part of the deal or not. We could make an argument that it is not part of the 
12" line, but could be sold to them along with the conveyance of the 12" 
line.  

This line was constructed to tie the 12" line into the suction side of the 
Maljamar compressor.  I don't think they would need this line for the 
intended purpose of "low pressure gathering" to the inlet of there plant.  
They may need it if they turn the line into residue service.  It would be 
another interconnect with TW (although a redundant one).

Let me know if this line is included, and if we need to get her the ROW info.

Thanks, Bob

I was in a meeting yesterday and found out that there is a 12" pipeline
located in the SW/4 Sec. 29 and SE/4 Sec. 30, T17S, R32E, Lea County, New
Mexico, that is part of the deal.  It is my understanding that this pipeline
was built by Transwestern a few years ago.  I did not see any right-of-way
agreements to cover this line when I was in your office this week.  Please
provide me with the right-of-way documentation to cover this pipeline.

If you have any questions, please call me at 281-293-2165.  I would
appreciate receiving this information as soon as possible.

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: Stranger's Gas Contract Discussion





Here is my first draft on the bullets for Steve Winston:  Please comment 
asap.  


Steve, per your followup phone call, here is a bullet point summary of the 
issues discussed in regard to the counter proposal regarding the Stranger's 
Gas contract negotiation.  I do not have George Drakes email address, so 
could you please forward this to him.  

1)   Ethane reimbursement needs to be at a minimum 4%
       If there is incidental ethane extracted, in conjunction with propane 
NNG will be reimbursed with the propane 

2)  In regard to point on netting months,   NNG does not agree with sentence 
one, ok with second sentence

3)  In regard to point on netting products,  NNG does not agree with this.  
This was not the intent nor the practice until KN commenced and is the issue 
being discussed in regard to the audit of the Stranger's Gas reimbursement.  
Per the bid package, Northern is requesting reimbursement by product, but 
does realize that it may receive zero for certain products after 
reimbursement has occurred for others.  

4)  In regard to point on reimbursement of Btu's,  NNG, on behalf of its 
customers, must be kept whole for the volumes.  The amount related to the 
Stranger's gas contract needs to be kept whole.  We are not resolving not 
addressing the measurement issue in the discussion of the Stranger's gas 
contract.

5)  The contract to be utilized is the pro forma included in the Bid package, 
however, Oneok is free to "mark up" with proposed changes to be specficially 
discussed.  All parties that participated in the bid process have utilized 
this contract, not the existing one. (The "mark up" is not to be a wholesale 
delete with the old contract language inserted.)

6)  In the event we are unable to reach agreement on the Stranger's Gas 
contract, NNG requests in writing an assurance of how Oneok is going to 
modify its facilities etc, to assure that it will not unlawfully take liquids 
that belong to others.  

7)  Agreed to meet in Omaha on Sept 6th starting at 9:00 am.

A prehearing conference was held last Friday in Phase II of Wisconsin Gas 
Company's proposal to build a 35-mile lateral to connect to the new Guardian 
pipeline.  The schedule and issues list adopted is detailed below.  It 
assumes issuance by mid-January of the final FERC EIS on the project.  

I would appreciate as soon as possible your feedback on whether or not 
Northern has any issues that should be addressed through the filing of 
testimony in this phase.  

Schedule

Jan. 25  --  Possible scheduling conference if FERC EIS has been delayed.  
10:30 a.m.

Feb. 20 -- Prefiled direct testimony due "in-hand" to all parties by noon.

Mar. 8   -- Prefiled rebuttal testimony due in-hand to all parties by noon.

Mar. 13 -- Prefiled surrebuttal testimony due in-hand to all parties by noon.

Mar. 19 -- Full week set aside for landowner hearings in the field - likely 
locations are Germantown and Oconomowoc.

Mar. 26 --Full week set aside for technical hearings in Madison.

Issues List

The formal issues list for Phase II will be included in the ALJ's prehearing 
order.  Subject to refinement of final wording it will look something like 
this:

---Physical aspects to the lateral and possible effects on landowners & the 
environment.

---FERC EIS & applicable WI statutes, including the Wisconsin Environmental 
Protection Act (WEPA).

---Engineering and safety

---Alternate routes

---Environmental implications including economic value and economic impact

---Landowner and land use implications/ Farmland productivity & economic 
effects on particular landowners.

Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...

The problem:

As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the 
following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: "if the rate 
bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be 
the maximum tariff rate," and the additional frustrating language "[a]ll 
available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."  At our 
last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could 
capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate 
to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount 
of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any 
index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I 
have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of 
other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum 
rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.  
However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical 
change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW 
lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.

Why the problem exists (you may already know):

Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in 
the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the 
Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for 
negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a 
cost-of-service based tariff rates.  "[T]he availability of a recourse 
service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that 
the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline 
unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the 
recourse rate mitigates market power."  

The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest 
rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its 
transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly 
not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper 
willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely 
because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  "When there are 
more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the 
pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either 
the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata 
basis if required by its tariff."  The example cited by the Commission:  If a 
pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one 
who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a 
negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata 
basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some 
other allocation method such as lottery).  

When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added 
the statement that "if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the 
rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."  Presumably we had 
concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order 
to receive negotiated rate authority.  

Solutions??

I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language 
outright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been 
chasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I 
keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is 
where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).  
Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the 
recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still 
have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic 
warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive 
proposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.

Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more 
than max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.  
We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more 
than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, 
despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely 
we can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be 
able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But 
I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that 
recourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either 
of you seen anything to the contrary?  

I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to 
discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to 
discuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few 
minutes.  Thanks.

El Paso Closer to Acquiring PG&E's Texas Assets

El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and 
liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a 
consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural 
gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing 
plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. 

PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from 
Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a 
profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter 
the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis 
between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has 
tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major 
player. 

The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and 
fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large 
industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value 
before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 
billion. 

Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the 
liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the 
cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities 
with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a 
merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the 
non-fee-based side. 

As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week 
is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has 
to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements 
are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth 
quarter.

FERC Proposes Major Changes to California's Wholesale Market
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a draft order outlin=
ing
a major overhaul of the California wholesale market, including changes
to market rules concerning the California ISO (Cal-ISO) and Power Exchange
(PX). Conceding that the market rules and structure for wholesale sales
of electricity are "flawed" and have caused "unjust and unreasonable" rates=
,
FERC has proposed a number of remedies that will become effective in=20
approximately
60 days. The full commission is expected to vote on the draft order in
December, after a period of industry comment.

ANALYSIS: FERC based its 77-page draft order on several assumptions, and
through the order intends to offer long-term (rather than band-aid) solutio=
ns.
First, FERC wants to hold overall rates to competitive levels that benefit
consumers, while at the same time induce sufficient investment in capacity
to ensure adequate service. Second, FERC acknowledged that some matters
that have adversely impacted the California wholesale market are not under
its jurisdiction, but that of the CPUC. Thus, FERC focused on matters withi=
n
its "exclusive jurisdiction," even if some of the proposals preempt prior
state decisions, while at the same time urging the state of California
to rectify issues within its own jurisdiction. This is an important point,
as FERC maintains that, unless the CPUC addresses issues such as the=20
inadequate
siting of generation and transmission and demand-side response, California
customers may still be exposed to higher prices that result from low supply=
.
Third, FERC could find no evidence of market power abuses, although it
did concede that the market in California certainly allows the opportunity
for market abuse when energy supplies are tight.

Further, FERC contends that California IOUs have been bidding up to 80
percent of their load into the day-ahead market and hour-ahead spot markets=
,
creating substantial short-term cost exposure. Due to regulatory restrictio=
ns
from California's restructuring law (AB1890), the IOUs were not able to
pursue a balanced portfolio, including long-term and intermediate contracts=
.
The central mission of FERC's order is to remove the restrictions that
kept California IOUs from moving significant amounts of wholesale transacti=
ons
into forward markets. The less reliant that the IOUs become on spot markets=
,
so goes FERC's theory, the less chance of price volatility=01*which should
not only reduce costs for customers, but also increase reliability and
increase prospects for new generation.

With that established, here's what FERC's order prescribes: 1). Eliminate
the requirement that California's three IOUs (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) must
sell into and buy from the PX. This proposal essentially permits the three
IOUs to establish bilateral contracts with energy suppliers, which was
previously restricted under AB1890. 2). Require market participants to
schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead markets. A penal=
ty
charge will be affixed for deviations in scheduling in excess of 5 percent
of an entity's hourly load requirements. Disbursement of penalty revenues
will be distributed to the loads that scheduled accurately. 3). The=20
establishment
of independent (non-stakeholder) governing boards for the California ISO
and PX. 4). The establishment of generation interconnection procedures.

FERC wants the CPUC to address the following issues: delays in siting=20
additions
of generation and transmission capacity; implementation of additional deman=
d
response programs at the retail level; and elimination of impediments on
load serving entities pursuing power supplies on a forward basis.

Perhaps most contentious within the order is FERC's decision to set a $150/=
MWh
rate cap so that bids above this amount cannot set the market clearing
price that is paid to all bidders. This policy negates a previous proposal
from the Cal-ISO, under which it lobbied for a $100/MWh bid cap (reduced
from $250/MWh) on electricity purchases in the ISO's spot market. FERC's
order freezes the ISO bid cap at its current $250 level for the next 60
days. However, beyond that FERC is instating what is being referred to
as a "soft price cap" of $150/MWh, to remain in place until December 2002.
 It's referred to as "soft" because sellers may bid above this level and
receive their bid if they are dispatched, but anything higher than $150/MWh
will not set the price that all generators will receive. Also, any generato=
r
setting a bid above $150/MWh must report their bid to the Commission, and
presumably fall under intense scrutiny.

The order revealed again some dissension with the FERC itself. Although
generally the four commissioners that delivered the order (Hoecker, Massey,
Breathitt, and H,bert) probably would agree that it is not perfect,=20
Commissioner
Hebert voiced the strongest disagreement with the order's principles. H,ber=
t
"hesitantly concurred" with the order, although he believed the commission
went too far in its attempt to mitigate prices, something he believes FERC
is ill-equipped to do. Specifically, H,bert dissented with the decision
to place any sort of price cap on wholesale transactions, preferring instea=
d=01*
as
he has advocated throughout his tenure as a FERC commissioner=01*"to entrus=
t
market participants with the ability and responsibility to mitigate their
price exposure as they deem best."

Moreover, it is questionable whether or not FERC has achieved its goals
of providing long-term solutions to California's problems. Rather, it seems
that the commission is sending a mixed message. On one hand, it is allowing
the California IOUs the freedom to buy and sell power outside of the PX,
which seems like a very pro-competition policy. Yet, on the other hand,
FERC establishes a price cap (albeit a soft, not hard, one) on wholesale
transactions, which arguably will continue to restrict true competitive
market forces from materializing in California. The commission is sending
a clear signal that all bids should be under $150/MWh and will undergo
interrogation if they are not, which essentially puts political pressure
on suppliers to maintain a price cap.

However, if one of the clear goals of this proposed order is to bring down
energy prices for California customers, removing the requirement of the
IOUs to buy and sell through the PX may actually accomplish this. The propo=
sal
changes the California structure to one in which local distribution compani=
es
(LDCs) could possibly wield more market power than the energy suppliers,
who essentially controlled prices when going through the PX. If the LDCs
know how to work economic deals, in which they set the price for the power
they purchase, this could ultimately drive energy costs down for customers.

As noted, FERC will vote on the proposed order in December, after receiving
commentary from industry participants. FERC Chair James Hoecker already
knows the position of one major player. He received a letter from Enron
CEO Kenneth Lay just this week, in which Lay urged FERC to avoid placing
"price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds." Lay further predicted that
installing price caps would "plunge markets into greater uncertainty and
discourage new supplies and conservation methods," and stated that a capped
formula would encourage natural-gas suppliers to deploy their turbines
in other states or countries. In addition, several consumer advocate groups
have expressed anger that FERC did not order refunds for San Diego customer=
s,
who bore the brunt of high energy prices this summer. In fairness to FERC,
it is questionable whether or not the commission has the legal authority
to provide a refund to San Diego customers as it did not find any evidence
of market manipulation.

Thus, there is little chance that we will see the end of the debate over
California any time soon. Rather, FERC's order, which presents itself as
a remedy to conflicts surrounding the wholesale market, has shown just
how polarized adversaries are within this debate. Yet, I believe the bottom
line of the proposed order is that it is a good first step to addressing
the fundamental problems within California's wholesale market, and marks
a significant start to what will undoubtedly be an ongoing discussion.

Attached is my redline of your Sat. draft.  In addition to the revisions in 
the doc, I have a few questions and concerns:
1.  On the segmenting section, I think it is a fine legal argument, but it 
lacks something.  What is our "or else" position?  Does the Global Settlement 
give us any FERC-out rights or colorable argument that the entire deal should 
be unwound if FERC screws up the segmenting issue?  I'm not suggesting that 
we should trigger a FERC out if we have one, but if we arguably do, we should 
consider threatening to use it.  I'm afraid we come across as whiny and 
FERC's position will likely be "so what, what are you going to do about it?"  
If we have no arguable "FERC-out" and the only  "or else" we have is that 
we'll take them to Court and force them to adhere to the original deal, I'm 
for leaving the draft as-is.  We can make our appeal threat more direct on 
rehearing if they hose us in the initial order.
2.  On the arbitrage argument, I've taken out any reference to an example and 
softened the verbiage a bit.  I want to leave in the references to the 
arbitrage issue, however, because FERC understands the problem and believes 
it is widespread.  We don't need to prove exactly how big a problem it is on 
our system (although it would have been very effective if we had clear facts).
3.  Do any of the OBA changes arguably conflict with the Global Settlement?  
If so, we'd  better be prepared to eat our words from the segmenting 
section.  Covering ourselves in the sanctity of that Settlement in section 1 
and then fiddling around with it in section 2 won't play well.  It is my 
understanding that the OBA system on TW was not part of the turnback 
resolution deal so I hope this won't be a problem.  
4.  On FN 20, I'd suggest we use Vig's data and chart for May of 2000.  The 
arb opportunity is huge and clear.  We reference in the FN that we use all 
six of the Gas Daily price points, and I think Vig used just 3.  What's the 
right answer?     

Good work everyone--please give it one more careful look on Monday AM and it 
should be good to go.  DF

Subject: TW's 637 Filing

I have tried to incorporate comments from our meeting last Thursday as well 
as written comments provided to me.  There are still some areas that we need 
to decide on.  For example, we need to determine if arbitrage argument works 
and finalize related Exhibits.  Also, re:  daily imbalance pricing at points 
that have EFM, are we keeping the 25,000 Dth??  Also, I'm not sure whether we 
confirmed that we have only called one Alert Day since 1994.  Finally, we 
need to double check the tariff language on autobalancing per note on page 29 
of draft.  Please review and provide me with comments early on Monday.  
Thanks.  Maria

PG&E Co. Proposes Huge Rate Increase to Recover Debt
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Last Wednesday, PG&E Co. proposed a five-year "rate stabilization plan"
that would allow the utility to pass along to customers more than $3 billio=
n
in power costs incurred last summer. Under PG&E's plan, submitted to the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for approval, average=20
residential
bills of $54.50 would increase to about $63.50 a month as of Jan. 1, 2001.
This amount is intended to accommodate potential wholesale price spikes
after an existing rate freeze ends by 2002. However, a portion of the incre=
ase
also would go to paying down the $3.4 billion in unforeseen charges that
PG&E insists are not the utility's responsibility.

ANALYSIS: Although most of the publicity related to the price spikes this
past summer focused on San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), the legacy of
the market problems in California is perhaps being carried by PG&E and
Southern California Edison (SCE), as both utilities have yet to fully enter
competitive markets within the state. This latest proposal from PG&E is
an attempt to save itself from what many have claimed will be financial
insolvency unless it can free itself from the staggering debt it currently
carries.

Let's first understand how PG&E found itself in the red, since this is
critical to the utility's argument that customers should be responsible
for the debt.  Due to its obligation to provide energy to customers in
its service territory, PG&E must its power on the wholesale market. In
addition, under California's restructuring mandates, PG&E had to buy its
power out of the Power Exchange (PX) rather than establishing bi-lateral
contracts with suppliers. The combination of low supply and high demand
drove up the wholesale cost of power in the PX this summer, which PG&E
faced as a buyer. Due to the retail rate freeze that is still in effect,
PG&E has been unable to pass on the high cost of power to its customers.
Although reports vary, on average PG&E has been paying up to 19 cents per
kilowatt hour on the wholesale market, when by law it is only allowed to
charge its customers on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour.  As a result
of these factors, PG&E has paid about $3.4 billion more to suppliers than
it can bill customers, and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions
each month. This explains the utility's motivation in wanting relief from
its debt, and also its argument that=01*since it was obligated to buy the
power for customers in the first place=01*its customers should ultimately
carry the burden for the high costs.

PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest,
or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid,
something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due
to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the
utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs
are already paid off. Consequently, PG&E has been lobbying to the CPUC
for several months for various options that would all result in PG&E custom=
ers
picking up the $3.4 billion tab. The utility first proposed to retroactivel=
y
bill customers for the debt. This latest proposal changes the course a
bit to provide for a rate increase, but the end result would essentially
be the same.

Under the proposal, PG&E's rate freeze would end Jan. 1, 2001, and resident=
ial
and small business customers would begin paying 6.5 cents per kilowatt
hour for five years, compared with the current wholesale costs of 15.2
cents per kilowatt hour (generation costs). Without such a rate stabilizati=
on
plan in place, PG&E warns that an average monthly bill could soar to more
than $108 after the rate freeze is lifted. The utility also contends that
the portion of the new rate that goes toward paying for the summer's high
prices amounts to less than 20 percent of the total monthly increases.
To reduce the impact on low-income customers, the utility plans to increase
their discount to 25 percent from the 15 percent they currently receive.
PG&E said there would be further increases on an annual basis if rates
proved not to be high enough to cover costs. If the deficit of uncollected
costs grew by $1 billion, for example, then rates at the start of 2002
would rise by one cent a kilowatt hour or around 15 percent to 7.5 cents.

Skeptics=01*including some within the CPUC=01*say PG&E is simply looking to=
 protect
its own interests. Carl Wood, a CPUC commissioner, referred to PG&E's propo=
sal
as "volume two of their bailout request" and noted that the request results
in a rate increase for most customers and complete recovery of all of the
utility's debt. The consumer group TURN contends that PG&E, and not custome=
rs,
is obliged to eat the cost of the debt it incurred. The group also argues
that, although PG&E has cast its proposal under a guise of customer=20
protection,
the proposal only really serves to assure PG&E of full recovery of its
debt. In addition, TURN noted that PG&E submitted its proposal to the CPUC
on the day before Thanksgiving, conceivably to downplay media attention
and avert an immediate negative reaction from the CPUC.

PG&E remains adamant that its customers should be made to pay off its debt,
and is determined to go to court if the CPUC does not approve its proposal.
PG&E believes that federal law would supports its right to bill customers
for debt it believes it accrued on its customers' behalf.

PG&E's proposal comes at a time when the utility's reputation has taken
a beating. A current report from the San Francisco Chronicle reveals that
the CPUC received more than 17,000 complaints about PG&E from 1997 to 1999.
According to the report, PG&E received more than three times as many=20
complaints
per customer as SDG&E during the past three years, which is quite significa=
nt
considering that SDG&E customers were exposed to bills that increased by
two and three times their normal amounts last summer. The comparison betwee=
n
PG&E and SDG&E was made because they are the only major private utilities
in the state to offer both electric and gas service.

PG&E also accounts for an unusually high percentage of complaints statewide=
.
>From 1997 to 1999, PG&E complaints represented 56 percent of the total
filed with the CPUC, even though it only has 39 percent of gas customers
and 46 percent of electric customers served by regulated utilities in the
state. Nearly three out of four complaints filed with the PUC against PG&E
concerned billing problems. In its own defense, PG&E claims that it faces
a unique set of weather-related conditions that make the service it provide=
s
to customers more fraught with problems, which consequently results in
more complaints.

It is unknown how state regulators will rule on PG&E's request, but prior
comments from Wood and other commissioners would indicate that the utility'=
s
proposal will be rejected. This casts a dark shadow over the future of
PG&E as, without being able to bill customers for its debt, it is uncertain
how the utility will continue to remain financially solvent. Ironically,
unregulated subsidiaries under the parent company PG&E Corp. continue to
perform well and show profits. Yet, the huge debt of PG&E Co. may become
an overwhelming anchor around the parent company's neck in the very near
future.

Actually, Mike, the cost benefit for you guys is pretty good since the hassle 
is mostly on the legal and regulatory folks where it belongs!   Seriously,  
the quarterly FERC filing I mentioned needs to be done anyway as I understand 
it because we use it to apprise FERC of various changes in our compliance.  
Since Rich's folks out there don't ordinarily have access to "confidential 
transportation related information" except maybe for occasional advance info 
on operational problems or outages, there shouldn't be much need for training 
or risk of accidental disclosures.  There is no filing fee or other out of 
pocket cost, and we are, as always,  eager to help with any deals that might 
bring some value to ET&S or Corp.  (and who knows how valuable a little 
sucking up to EES might be in the long run!?) .  Just let us know what you 
decide to do and we'll get the paperwork done.  Thanks.  DF

Rich - Is this really worth the hassle? All the upside is on the side of EES, 
all the downside (work) appears to be on our side. It would appear to me that 
EES could rent an office in some executive office space provider .....but 
maybe I don't have my Enron hat on.

If the cost savings are worth a little bit of hassle, we can do this.  We'll 
need to make a FERC filing by the end of the 1st Q 2000 to identify the 
"shared facilities."  Also, if you decide to go forward, don't do it until 
1-1-2000 so we don't have to scramble to get the info in front of FERC this 
quarter.  Let me and Maria know what you decide to do and we'll arrange a 
briefing on the specific rules to be aware of and we'll make sure we 
understand the situation fully so we can properly disclose to FERC what is 
up.  Please call with any questions. Thanks.  DF

EES is a marketing affiliate, so we do need to be careful about shared

able to do it, otherwise, the hassles and expense of building marketing

No, not that I know of.  I've never met the western Fossum, but I do know the 
guys who own Western Hub pretty well--John Strom and Larry Bickle.  If we 
have any interest in this project or other merchant storage in California, 
these are the guys to deal with as they have mapped about 90% of the state 
looking for salt or other storage plays.

CA Merchant Storage Plant Passes Major Test

     California regulators Thursday released a final environmental impact 
report for the
     state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the 
Sacramento
     Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding 
landowners,
     Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage 
project
     operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the 
approval process for
     environmental review. 

     Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project 
in Texas and
     it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in 
the Bakersfield area,
     according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. 

     Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of 
Sacramento should
     come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this 
summer and be
     operational before the end of the year. "We see the environmental report 
as the 'light at
     the end of the tunnel'," Fossum said. 

     Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California 
Public Utilities
     Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) 
identifying the
     project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then 
was circulated
     to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before 
the final
     report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were 
held by the CPUC
     last October. 

     Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative 
law judge
     for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period 
before the
     project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, 
a CPUC
     spokesperson said. 

     "We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already 
have our
     compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and 
that can go pretty
     quickly," Fossum said. "In the best of all worlds it would be this year; 
in the worst case,
     it would be a year from now." 

     Western Hub has some of its customers lined up, and it is in current 
discussions with
     others, said Fossum, declining for competitive reasons to even identify 
the types of
     customers, although they are expected to be large shippers, marketers, 
power plant
     operators and other large industrial customers. 

     The Lodi project is designed for full operation as having a 12 Bcf 
working capacity,
     with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacities. It will 
be
     connected to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone transmission system 
through a
     35-mile pipeline consisting of three miles of 30-inch-diameter and 32 
miles of
     24-inch-diameter pipe. During the past year's delay in start-up, Western 
has "moved
     the pipeline around a bit, but not a whole lot," Fossum said. "to make 
accommodations
     to nearby farmers." 

     Western Hub's similar-sized Texas project is south of San Antonio and 
would be
     connected with three natural gas transmission systems in the area: 
Houston Pipeline,
     PG&E --- Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
"We
     expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 

     Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
the Bakersfield
     area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
expects to have
     more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
California project
     moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 

     Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
have to connect
     with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
The combined
     Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area.

Lindy, your example is correct for settling operator imbalances.  If we have 
a payable operator imbalance
and we settle volumetrically, then we get fuel and transport.  But, I thought 
the "netting and trading" in Order 637
was on Shipper imbalances only.  I am not sure what we mean by "no additional 
cost, etc" mentioned below.
I'll call you in the morning (Thursday) to discuss further,  since I am not 
familiar with the PNM protest.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject: Re: TW  

I think the example of when quantities may be subject to transportation and 
fuel is when an Operator overpulls at a delivery point and then cashes out 
the imbalance, TW could be out the transport and fuel.  For example,  

  DP is SoCal/Needles: scheduled volume is 700,000/d
     actual volume delivered is 720,000/d
     imbalance is 20,000/d, SoCal owes TW
     TW collects transport & fuel on 700,000/d (bill on scheduled volume)
     SoCal cuts a check to TW for dollar value of 20,000/d
     TW doesn't collect transport & fuel on 20,000/d
  Payback in-kind doesn't have this problem:
     The 20,000/d transport gets scheduled at Needles, TW collects the 
transport & fuel      (bill on scheduled volume), but we physically give 
SoCal 20,000/d less on that day

Is this the correct example?  I'm copying Lynn Blair to verify.

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

A MEMO FROM DICK AMABILE


Thanks for enrolling in the upcoming P&D Facilitation training.  In order to 
make the best use of our limited time at the meeting I am attaching a copy of 
the "draft" material which will appear on the Intranet Site regarding P&D 
(Participation & Dissent).   The intent is for you to review the material 
before the session to gain some insight into what P&D is all about.  This 
will save us the time of having to review this material at the session and 
allow us to focus specifically on facilitation skills for the P&D process.  
We apologize for the somewhat disjointed format.  At the moment it is the 
only complete draft that is available, albeit in pieces.  I suggest you start 
with the last one listed below P&D Site maps.ppt and then progress through 
them in order 1,2,3,4,5.



P&D  was develop as a response to three of the 5 core ETC (Now known as the 
Pulse) questions identified by Enron for improvement. They are: 

  Most employees feel free to voice their opinions openly 
  My operating company does a good job acting on suggestions of employees
  Employees are encourage to challenge established 
procedures/policies/guidelines

Participation & Dissent know as "P&D" is an unique Enron created tool that is 
designed to provide our employees with a creative, free wheeling, 
non-bureaucratic vehicle for solving problems, addressing issues, enhancing 
decision making and developing new business ideas/opportunities.   One 
purpose of "P&D" is to create an atmosphere where employees can feel real 
ownership for decisions and express their views in a challenging and 
passionate way. "P&D" sessions are meant to focus on results and assist in 
producing measurable performance improvements.  "P&D" sessions are to assist 
our employees in driving change in an organized, efficient and effective 
manner.  It will help us leverage off our own best practices to produce 
faster results that positively impact our return on invested capital. At 
Enron we give our employees the power to dissent and with that power comes 
the obligation to participate in providing solutions/ideas. 

If you have any questions about this material, please feel free to contact 
Kirk McDaniel or myself.  We will be happy to answer your questions and 
provide additional context for the effort.

The only other thing we would like you to do prior to attending the session 
is to identify a potential P&D intervention within your own organization.  
This will provide you with a "real" effort to begin planning for at the 
session and make the application of the ideas directly actionable for you.

We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
            Dick Amabile

In your weekly report, I noted that Martin Allday's deposition is scheduled

issues, Mr. Allday's deposition will be conducted in Washington DC.  If our 
lawers and Conoco's lawyers will be in DC, I could just as easily fly to DC 
vs. Houston for my deposition.  

Is this worth pursuing?????

Mike Moran has informed me that the FTC and U.S. DOJ, as part of their review 
of the El Paso-Coastal merger, have decided to take a close look at the 
merger's possible impact on competition in the Chicago-Wisconsin market.  In 
this regard, those agencies need to set up a conference call in the next two 
weeks to discuss that issue with experts on that market from Border and 
Northern.  This will not be an on-the-record deposition.  It will be a conf. 
call and what I expect to be an  informal question and answer session on what 
we know.   Representatives of the Wisconsin and Illinois Attorney General's 
office (or whatever agency it is in those states that deals with antitrust 
issues) will be on the phone as they are working with the Feds on the 
merger.  I think either one of you guys, with appropriate supervision, would 
do a fine job.  Please let me and Mike know who gets the black bean and what 
your general availability is and we'll get it set up.  Thanks. DF

I think the safest and most efficient way to comply with this request is to 
have Keith and Ray briefed and ready to answer all FERC's questions without 
deferring any to other people.  Ray and Keith, please talk to Gary Zahn and 
make sure you are up to speed on everything FERC has asked for and focused on 
so far.  You don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic 
understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more 
responsive to what they want to ask you about.  If you do get stumped, try to 
defer the question by telling FERC you need to check on a fact or two and can 
answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview.  By doing 
that , you should be able to get them the information they need without 
having them cross examine a bunch of other people.  Inevitably, if you ask 
enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers.  
Lee, I'd like you to be on the phone call with Ray, Keith and Gary to discuss 
generally what to be ready for and what FERC has already looked at.  Please 
let me know if anyone has any concerns about this approach.  DF

We all knew about this concept--its Danny's "Newco" idea.  The only thing 
that is new is they finally decided on a name and got the paperwork for the 
new corporate entity out of the Corporate Secretary's office.  I knew about 
the name a couple weeks ago.  As far as I know, no one has signed off on any 
particular transaction or on a procedure to follow when "Mavrix" starts 
transacting business.  We all better understand at that point that this may 
be a "lose lose" deal--if Mavrix makes a ton of money, everyone will come 
after it (as soon as they find out) and claim we arre playing games with 
confidential information if Mavrix is trading capacity on the Enron pipes.  
If Mavrix loses money, tough cookie--there's no way to plow the losses back 
into some regulated entity.  It is probably now time to have a prayer meeting 
with Danny, Steve, and probably Stan, just to make sure everyone knows what 
we all think about the risks before they charge off and start doing deals.

I thought the officers had discussed this with Danny quite some time ago, as 
the organization of the company was set in motion in early Dec.

Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp. has been organized as a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of ETS for the purpose of transportation capacity management.  The 
officers are the same as the slate of officers of Transwestern.   The company 
will neither buy or sell gas nor use transportation capacity.  However, it 
does plan to enter into natural gas transportation contracts (and resell the 
capacity thru capacity release).  That is why the creditworthiness question 
has come up.
I really don't have any information so send you, unless you want to see the 
organizational documents.  Steve Harris can answer any business-related 
questions you have.  Or, I'll be happy to try to answer any other questions.

Subject: Gallup -- monitoring system issue  


Drew, since my message to you this morning I've spoken with Gerald Nemec and 
Mark Knippa and here is what I've been able to learn.  ECS's position is that 
they could not begin getting a monitoring system in place (automated or 
manual) until it could obtain access to CDEC's website, which required the 
execution of a confidentiality agreement with Tri-State to protect the 
confidential information on the website.  I do not remember exactly when I 
first reviewed the confidentiality agreement; I believe I OK'd a draft 
agreement sometime over the summer (Schedule 21 became effective sometime in 
July), and I received executables from Gerald Nemec around Thanksgiving, 
which I had signed and returned to ECS.  The confidentiality agreement was 
fully executed as of Dec. 8, 2000.  ECS blames the delay between draft and 
execution on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on the 
confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.  

Currently ECS is working with Kevin Hyatt on getting an automated system in 
place.  TW has access to the CDEC website, but such access is of limited use 
until an automated system is implemented, because identifying peaks would 
require continuous monitoring.  Apparently the programming is being done 
through Arnold Eisenstein's group (using an outside contractor, I believe).  
In fact, EE&CC has been responsible for the automated system from the outset, 
in that development of the monitoring system was included in ECS's payments 
to EE&CC.  

ECS believes they have done everything possible to fulfill their obligation 
to develop a monitoring system.  But they also argue that even if they did 
not fulfill this obligation, they are not responsible for the expenses TW 
incurred due to use of the compressor during peak load periods, as the 
implementation of a monitoring system is no guarantee that peak loads will 
actually be avoided.  While ECS does have a point, this is still a pretty 
harsh legal position for ECS to take with an affiliate and business partner.  
If ECS breached its obligation, it should take responsibility for its share 
of the consequences.

The difficult question is whether ECS breached the obligation.  What is "good 
faith" is subjective.   Since the confidentiality agreement is for the 
protection of CDEC, ostensibly the Enrons could have just signed an agreement 
and sent it to CDEC and it would have been binding on us.  However, issuance 
of a password and access to the website was totally within CDEC's 
discretion.  It is difficult to know whether there is anything ECS or TW 
could have done to expedite the process.   Also, we will probably never be 
able to tell for sure how long the confidentiality agreement sat on CDEC's 
and ECS's desks prior to execution.  

Going forward, until an automated system is implemented, TW will still risk 
being charged for peak demand until it monitors the website continuously.  If 
we do monitor the system manually, I believe the agreement does obligate ECS 
to reimburse us for the additional employee time.  I asked Mark Knippa to 
find out how soon the software could be installed.  Kevin should, probably 
follow up with him on this.

Please call me; while writing this I had a gut feeling I should probably talk 
to you about it before sending to the larger group.  Centilli appears more 
than anxious to get this resolved (and is adamant that ECS owes us money).  
Thanks.

Subject: Re: Gallup Rebate  

Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.  Article 6 of the 
Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) 
with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an 
automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading 
conditions on CDEC's system.  We had a pretty good idea when we signed the 
contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start 
date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to 
"assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same 
result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and 
expenses" associated with the manual system.  We will fight with them about 
who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to 
"assist" us in managing the cost.  In the mean time, we need to make sure 
that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to 
mitigate future costs.  Do we have someone who is watching this out there?  
We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to 
manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.  James 
had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I 
guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to 
us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.  That sounds like a 
BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we 
can figure out a solution.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: Gallup Rebate

Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression 
Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management.  My understanding 
was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order 
for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak 
load periods.  We have not received access to this information which has 
resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of 
July through September.  Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder 
of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.  This cost is 
averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have 
in August and September.

Sorry you are feedling bad. Hope reading email doesn't hurt. I'll try and be 
brief. 
1. We have an opportunity to acquire a? 35MW? cogeneration facility in Kansas 
that is from the early 1980's and rarely used. We may want to talk about a? 
joint project. Can I borrow some expertise via a phone call fom you to your 
electric gurus to let me know what the spot market into KC and Wichita looks 
like.

2. I met with DML and we intend to propose a deal that has us charging only

Wow.  Pretty interesting info.  I'm trying to think of a "plan B" approach, 
but without ENA (and their turbines) I'm haviang a hard time coming up with 
one.  Steve, I'll talk to you in Tucson on this.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: Pueblo

 I spoke to Frank Vickers who is responsible for ENA's power generation 
projects for the Western half of the United States. We discussed the 
opportunities for a generation project in the Albuquerque region and he 
offered the following observations.

 First, he indicated ENA has evaluated numerous projects in that area 
including participation in the Cobisa project. They always come to the same 
conclusion which is that the project economics become non-workable due power 
grid constraints and the inability to negotiate a long-term wheeling 
arrangement with PNM. He felt like the only reason Cobisa could go forward 
was due to PNM being the purchaser of power from the project. 

 We talked about lower the delivered cost of gas to the facility through a 
"zero return" pipeline but in the end what the generation facility would have 
to compete with is power from and around Palo Verde. He is very familiar with 
the ENA model (in fact he could calculate various electric costs immediately 
just based on some parameters I mentioned to him over the phone). In the end, 
he felt like ENA would not want to participate because the risk of having to 
sell the excess power at a competitive rate was just too great given the cost 
to get it to a market.

 We will continue to give the Pueblo project a final look by talking to 
Plains and Four Corners but without the baseload generation the pipeline 
prospects look pretty dismal.

I agree with you that par. 4 doesn't give NMNG anything beyond what the 
tariff and general contract law gave them.  The "subject to agreement by 
Transwestern" language is redundant since the previous clause says " by 
mutual written agreement."  Additionally, its confusing and innacurate 
because the "provided, however, that" clause isn't even binding if we 
mutually agree to eliminate it.   I therefore think we ought to take par. 4 
out, or at least remove the "provided however" clause.  I don't agree that we 
can only decrease their MDQ by using capacity release.  We can mutually agree 
to terminate their contract or reduce their MDQ without using cap. release.  
I suppose we would need to use cap. release if the termination or reduction 
of their MDQ was a sham designed to get the capacity from NMNG to another 
shipper, however. 

I would propose one change to Par. 3 just to make the discount more clear.  
The par. talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary 
receipts.  I'd add this, after the words "Appendix A" at the end of the 
current first sentence:

"and receipts at the primary points of receipt set forth on Appendix A.  The 
discounted rate shall also apply to receipts at alternate receipt points in 
Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) area."

I'm a fan of being extremely clear when we limit availability of discounts, 
and think we should always fully explain what the discount applies to at both 
the receipt and delivery end of the deal.  

Susan, please work with Christine to get these changes made.  I'd like to 
eliminate par. 4 entirely, but I can live with it if the business people want 
to leave it in, as long as we eliminate the "provided however" clause.   With 
these changes, I'm OK with the contract.  Thanks.

Subject: Transwestern Contract Approval Request

The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed 
to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but 
also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous 
amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can 
decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release 
procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & 
doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by 
mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not 
seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, 
I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or 
similar language to reflect the "deal" --- or at least the conversations of 
the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing 
folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and 
explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments?

Subject: ECS and the $500k reduction

Rod, Steve, & James:

In rough terms, this is what I understand ECS' logic to be -

The $3.35 per KW for transmission demand charge was assumed not to be 
avoidable and have a 5000 KW minimum when ET&S and ECS agreed on the $2.8MM 
one time payment.
ECS says that they have negotiated to make the transmission demand charge 
avoidable with no minimum.
$3.35 * 10,000HP / 1.341 = $25k
$25k discounted 10 years = $1.9MM
25% of 1.9MM = approx. $500k
Original one time payment = $2.8MM less $0.5MM = $2.3MM (the new payment ECS 
wants to give ET&S)

ECS contends that Fastuca agreed to a 25% sharing of benefits received from 
the avoidable demand.  My recollection is that the 25% was used as a 
benchmark to estimate ECS' fee but was never established as a firm rule.

ECS is supposed to provide us with their own written explanation for the 
$500k reduction.  They are also supposed to send us the "re-negotiated" rate 
schedule 21 that shows the transmission demand charge becoming avoidable.

In any event, whether it is reasonable or not that ECS is due the $500k, it 
is reasonable to expect that ET&S would have been notified of this change in 
a more timely manner.

Subject: Next PG&E Meeting/SoCal

Mr. Campbell and I will meet Dr. Komai from SoCal in the late morning or 
early afternoon on the 19th in San Francisco.  After our discussions we will 
meet the rest of the group back at the Hyatt.  It is doubtful that Dr. Komai 
will have more than a couple of hours of information to share with the group 
on the 20th so we might considered targeting a departure time in 
mid-afternoon.

Dr. Komai related that the PG&E press activity has caused concern at the 
management level in SoCal and prompted a new round of rigorous sampling 
efforts.

Subject: Citizens request for proposal  

Rich,
Thanks for the note.  If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our 
next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to 
operate their Griffith system.  We can "hedge" our proposal based on the need 
to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be 
necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting 
word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be.

Randy from operations side we wouldn't have a problem operating the system if 
it can be worked out through legal. If it's decided that we will do this 
there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost 
together if you would like.
Thanks

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Subject: TW Compressor Monetization

Attached is my analysis based on a sales price of $14.2MM and $14.8MM with a 
buy back in the 7th year.  The loan structure for Hanover assumes that the 
difference between the sales price and TW's buy back price would be amortized 
over the contract term.  The remaining balance of the loan is assumed to be a 
balloon payment at the end of the finance term.

I will put together some analysis on a 9 year term and forward this on to you 
when it is completed.

Susan, you asked about Texas during our telephone conversation.  I should 
mention that Texas has a statute that prohibits demanding or selling at an 
excessive price such things as fuel, food and medicine if the Governor has 
declared a disaster, which I assumed didn't fit our scenario.  I didn't see 
anything in the Texas case law but it was a quick look.

follows:

Because call options are only sold after we have tried to sell the underlying 
capacity and there were no takers at max. rate or an acceptable price, there 
is really only 1 variable -- the total rate (consisting of the option 
component and the strike price).

The call option is posted for a specific quantity, start date, etc.  There 
are no other variables.  It's just price.

>From our discussions with Mike Coleman and crew on this topic -- I think is 
it absolutely key that we keep the award variables to a minimum.  My take is 
that the transmittal letter referring to highest price is the right way to 
go.  The concept in the tariff about posting the evaluation criteria 
(implying that there are more variables) could kill the deal.

Dear General Counsels:

The attachments are Westlaw October allocations and Lexis-Nexis September 
Usage (Actuals) reports.  Please feel free to call me if you have any 
questions.

   

We had an amendment to Westlaw contract to include Public Records and Dow 
Jones/Company News with current $14,000 monthly rate in August.   As of 
today, I am still working with Westlaw to get Aug. and Sept. charges to 
reflect the changes (total about $5,000 credit).  I apologize for not having 
the corrected Westlaw invoices to do Aug. and Sept. allocation reports to 
you.   

October Lexis Nexis Usage report has not coming yet.  August one, according 
to Julie Pechersky was sent to me but got lost in the mail.  I am in the 
process having Lexis to send us another copy.   Again I apologize for the 
long wait even it's not under my control.

Thanks,
Sylvia Hu

Peace Software Lands MidAmerican Energy Account
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

Peace Software, a global provider of leading e-business solutions for retai=
l
energy companies, announced that MidAmerican Energy Company, a supplier
of energy in the Midwest's deregulating market, has selected Peace's Energy
software suite for a rapid entry into multiple deregulated markets. "Peace
Energy is a better system for serving our unregulated electric and gas
customers since we now have the capability to bill for multiple fuels,
services and locations on a single statement," said Todd Raba, vice preside=
nt
of market and sales at MidAmerican Energy.

ANALYSIS: This could materialize into a very strategic alliance for both
companies. On the national or international stage, Des Moines, Iowa-based
MidAmerican may not be considered a major player. Yet, within the Midwest,
it is a recognizable brand name and sizeable presence. The company and
its subsidiaries manage and own interests in more than 10,000 MW of=20
diversified
power generation facilities around the world, providing both regulated
and unregulated electric and natural-gas services to more than 1.3 million
customers in six states and the United Kingdom (through its Northern Electr=
ic
& Gas subsidiary). In August, MidAmerican made its move into Ohio, the
fourth largest U.S. market in terms of customers (behind California, Texas
and Florida), indicating that the utility intends to aggressively grow
in the retail sector and gain a corner on the increasingly competitive
Midwest market. Just last Monday, MidAmerican became the first energy compa=
ny
to become registered as a certified retail electric supplier (CRES) in
the Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. territory in southwest Ohio.

An essential element to the utility's growth is a comprehensive billing
software system, which is where the value of Peace Software comes in.=20
According
to MidAmerican, it aims to be able to provide customers with online energy
usage and billing data on a 24/7 basis. Also important to MidAmerican as
it enters different states is the elimination of "several automated and
manual processes required by our current system." This can result in a
real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office
functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes, all
of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software.
In this particular case, Peace's Energy software will provide to MidAmerica=
n
customers several self-serve features, including customer enrollment, summa=
ry
billing, more flexible due dates and electronic payment options. The Energy
System was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling
many functions required by retailers, from enrollment and registration
to billing to settlement and load forecasting. The last two features are
particularly noteworthy as, up to this point, they have been rarely found
in billing software. Many systems in the United States today are building
this competency or are "bolting on" the technology; Peace already offers
it in a "one-stop-shop" tool.

Peace Software is a growing company and had secured some key utility contra=
cts
prior to this one with MidAmerican, including Enron, BC Gas, Dominion Retai=
l,
Nordic Electric, Exelon Energy, and Pepco Services. The company is based
in Atlanta and maintains a large presence in its country of origin, New
Zealand, the first country to deregulate its electric utilities.

I spoke with Brian Peace, CEO of Peace Software, last June and he gave
an overview of how the Energy System functions. First, the Energy System
is centered around the UNIX operating system and thus can be moved and
upgraded from one hardware platform to another. Since its start in 1988,
Peace Software has designed the Energy System around a multiple-product
architecture that has enabled the company to encapsulate water, gas and
electricity into one product suite. Currently, the system handles not only
those three commodities, but also can consolidate billing information relat=
ed
to telecommunications, home security, home mortgaging and other value-added
commodities and services. The end result is that an energy service provider
can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost, which is
a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing.

At the time of our discussion, Peace said, "ESPs can no longer just rely
on a commodity margin anymore. They've got to be able to buy it at the
right price, combine it with the right services and then deliver it in
a very convenient way to the customers. This is the path to being competiti=
ve
and profitable."

Over the last decade, Peace Software gained a real lock on the New Zealand
market, and began selling its technology in the United States in 1997.
That same year the company secured a contract with Enron, which at the
time owned Portland General and was attempting to penetrate the California
retail market. Of course, Enron ultimately extinguished its retail marketin=
g
efforts in California, but still uses the Peace Energy software as it=20
continues
to penetrate other markets. Peace Software's alliance with InSITE=01*a New
York-based application service provider=01*has led to providing the softwar=
e
for the billing needs of Exelon. Brian Peace has said that for all of these
utilities the key value of the software is the added convenience that they
can market to new customers.

Of course, although Peace Software's contract with MidAmerican certainly
elevates the company and gives it additional stature in the Midwest market,
the billing software business presents stiff competition. Perhaps the two
greatest competitors for Peace Software are SCT and Excelergy. SCT offers
the SCT Banner product, which was originally created to bill multiple=20
commodity
customers in the utility environment and has done quite well. ENLOGIX uses
the SCT Banner system to support multi-services across its client base
including gas, financing, ancillary products, electricity, water, and solid
waste. Excelergy was incubated in the deregulating states of the Northeast
while Peace was incubated in the deregulating markets of New Zealand and
Australia. Peace Software and Excelergy also have recently made their own
inroads into the gas markets. Peace has entered the Canadian gas market
by implementing its Energy software product at BC Gas, headquartered in
Vancouver, which serves about 750,000 customers. Excelergy has implemented
its billing product at Boston Gas, which serves about 535,000 customers.


As competitive ESPs attempt to secure new customers in deregulating markets=
,
one of the key advantages will be a convenient and multi-faceted billing
and customer care system. Facing a cloud of rather similar pricing offers,
customers may be more enticed to select an ESP that offers the value-added
service offerings found in software developed by Peace and its competitors.
MidAmerican has branded itself with the tag line "Obsessively, Relentlessly
At Your Service." The company is obviously making customer service a=20
centerpiece
of its competitive strategy by adopting the Peace Energy software suite
to support its entry into new markets.

Glad to help--concocting market based rates for storage facilities that 
probably don't deserve them is one of the few things I know how to do.  DF

Subject: Market-Based Storage

ENA is pursuing a gas storage project.  One assumption of their project 
development is the ability to attain market-based pricing for the facility.  
Tom Shelton called  looking for a primer on how to apply for market-based 
rates.   I gave him the 10,000 ft story of how any regulated entity can apply 
for market-based rates under the Alternatives to Traditional Ratemaking 
policy statement, but that to date only storage facilities have been 
successful in willing market-based rate treatment.  I think his client is 
looking for more of a procedural look at what needs to be done.  Do you care 
if I send  them  a copy of the market-based storage testimony from the last 
NNG rate case?    Sorry, but I mentioned that you forged market based storage 
services for Market Hub Partners in your former life.  So, don't be surprised 
if you hear from Tom Shelton or his client John Allario.

First,  I thought the inservice was to be earlier than 3rd quarter??  confused
Second, on term I'd suggest we say a minimum of five years, so if someone 
wants to bid for a longer term they can--
Third, in the 3rd paragraph change the reference to term, to as specifed 
above-
Fourth, in the last paragraph, add minimum term of five years again.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

In my summer update about the acquisition of MG Plc and the integration of=
=20
the metals business into Enron, I reported that we were aiming to complete=
=20
the integration by the end of the year. I am pleased to report that we are=
=20
well on the way to meeting this target. =20

September was a busy month for the metals business as it brought with it bo=

the co-location of the London and Tokyo-based metals staff with Enron=01,s=
=20
offices and the first quarter of combined reporting under Enron Europe. =20
Ensuring a smooth transition for both the metals staff and the metals syste=

teams across the company on the part of the former MG team and the=20
integration team at Enron Europe.  Nevertheless, =01&D-Day=018 arrived with=
 minimal=20
problems and the metals team open for business as usual on the morning of=
=20
September 18th. =20

Another key initiative that commenced during September was the re-positioni=
ng=20
of the MG worldwide metals business as Enron Metals. With the exception of=
=20
the Henry Bath & Son Limited warehousing division, which will remain as=20
currently named, the re-branding initiative was kicked off in the UK and=20
followed by Japan and the US.  The re-branding initiative is on going with=

the end of November.

Enron Metals is represented throughout the world.  I have attached a region=

In light of the progress that has been made since the summer, I thought it=

business areas and identify those members of the metals team who will be=20

Enron this summer.  Today on EnronOnline we are trading six metals (Copper,=

from a couple of trades per day in September to a high of 300 in October. T=

Origination

Enron Metals established a London-based commercial unit under the direction=
=20
of Eric Gadd, Vice President-Global Metals Origination which is focused on=
=20
completing highly structured and long-dated transactions.  It will integrat=

and other business units inside Enron is essential if we are to succeed in=

here is appreciated.

Warehousing (Henry Bath & Son Limited) =20

The Warehousing operations, led by Ed Dablin, operate under the name of Hen=

Presently, Henry Bath maintains over three million square feet of storage=

Congatulations Drew!  I have mixed emotions on your leaving Omaha.  On the 
downside I'm sincerely going to miss your day-to-day presence that brings 
thoughtful incites, hard work and a fun zest-for-life atmosphere to the

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike

Just so you can see how this is evolving...
I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because 
it sounds like we are buying/selling gas.
I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When 
they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only 
information she still needs from us, I think.  
I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today.

OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:

Avale Corp.
I also like Enable.
I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...

Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

Attached is a draft of an "operational control agreement" designed to address 
the concerns stated in FERC's order approving the Gallup project.  We may or 
may not actually file it as part of the required compliance filing, but will 
describe it in detail in the "report" FERC ordered us to file.  The 
substantive terms track the language that is already in the O&M Agreement.  
Please give me or Susan a call with any questions or comments you may have.  
We expect to file this by I believe the 12th of Feb.  or so.  Thanks.  DF

This is a problem your people should be aware of because I think our usual 
practice when we want to verify ownership structure is to call the corporate 
secretary's office.  If they are behind, I don't know who we should go to in 
the future.  Maybe we need to run everything by corp. tax from now on.  Ugh.

The erroneous statements found in the Form 2 related to Transwestern today 
are traceable in part to the fact that the Corporate Secretary's Data Sheets 
are months behind in their accuracy.  This is not the first instance where 
serious and costly errors have been made by persons who were relying on the 
data sheets for accurate ownership information on Enron Corp. subsidiaries.

If you have any creative ideas on finding a remedy for the extremely long lag 
time between the submission of final documentation to the Corporate Secretary 
and the updating of the sheets, please let me know.  In the meantime, be 
aware that the information is not necessarily reliable.

Subject: Re: PG & E Capacity  

Paul, as we discussed on the phone, here are my conclusions on the 
terminability of our firm contracts with PG&E.  I believe Drew and Shelley 
concur (and they are welcome to add their comments, of course).  

If PG&E fails to comply with our request for assurance of creditworthiness, 
the "Termination" provisions of Section 16.1(b) of our General Terms and 
Conditions will be triggered.  If PG&E fails to perform any obligation under 
a service agreement, TW may terminate the agreement under the following 
procedure:  1) TW serves written notice on PG&E that it is in default, and 
that TW intends to terminate the agreement, 2) PG&E gets 30 days to remedy 
the default, 3) if PG&E does not remedy the default within 30 days, the 
agreement shall become null and void, after we obtain the requisite 
regulatory approvals, which Shelley advises me would include obtaining 
abandonment authority from FERC.  
 
The Bankruptcy Code provides that a utility may not alter, refuse or 
discontinue service to a debtor solely because of commencement of a 
bankruptcy action or because a debt owed by the bankruptcy debtor was not 
paid when due.  However, the utility may alter, refuse or discontinue service 
if neither the trustee nor the debtor, within 20 days after the date of an 
order for relief, furnished adequate assurance of payment for service after 
such date.  I am not a bankruptcy expert, but my point is simply that our 
rights may change once a bankruptcy action is filed.  Let's hope that our 30 
days runs before PG&E goes to Bankruptcy Court.  FERC has held that 
termination of service cannot be inconsistent with federal bankruptcy law:  
see El Paso Natural Gas Company, 61 FERC P61,302 (1992) (involving El Paso 
Electric bankruptcy).

As far as whether there could be a temporary release of PG&E's capacity, our 
tariff does not contain any provision under which we could compel any shipper 
to release its capacity.  PG&E certainly has the ability to release its 
capacity, but it does not sound as if they would want to without some 
incentive.

If there are any other questions give me a call (or Drew or Shelley).

Subject: Re: PG & E Capacity  

I am not sure I exactly understand your question. It is possible for us to 
sell the space if PG&E were to release it. However, I am sure PG&E has no 
intention of letting it go as they need it for their core supplies. Also, 
since the market value of the space is greater than what they pay us it would 
cost them more money in the long run to get rid of it and have to buy/ ship 
supplies under some other supply arrangement. For an answer to any legal 
rights they have Susan Scott would be the best one to answer that. 
Thanks.

Subject: PG & E Capacity

 Steve,

 The question has been brought up in regard to the capacity that PG&E holds 
and it's marketability, in the event that PG &E defaults and goes into 
bankruptcy.  Could a preauthorized temporary release of this capacity be 
considered where performance would continue, while PG & E would retain it's 
liability under the Firm Contracts?


 Thanks and Regards.

Subject:  Government Affairs Organizational Changes


FYI:  Attached is a memo from Rick Shapiro outlining organizational changes
in the Government Affairs group, most significantly the appointment of a
new head of the Washington office.

This is a great time to be at Enron. The challenges and opportunities at
Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day.  This presents enormous
challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us
individually.  As we discussed at the staff meeting last month, this
requires us to constantly reevaluate our priorities, our methods of getting
things done, and whether our organization is properly structured to meet
the needs of the entire company.  While we have done an outstanding job as
a group within our current structure, changes are necessary at this time.

The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the
assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals
within the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government
Affairs strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies.
The below mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities:

1.   Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets:  Jim Steffes
2.   The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies:  Harry Kingerski
3.   Enron Broadband Services:  Sue Nord
4.   Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks:  Lisa Yoho
5.   Enron South America:  Jose Bestard
6.   Federal Government Affairs:  Linda Robertson

     With the impending retirement on March 31, 2001 of Joe Hillings, I am
     pleased to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on
     November 6, 2000, as a Vice President who will immediately assume
     responsibility for leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our
     Washington office.  Linda was a Congressional staffer and
     partner/principal in two Washington law firms prior to spending the
     last eight years with the U.S. Department of Treasury, the last five
     as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public Liaison, for
     Secretaries Rubin & Summers.  Linda brings a terrific background, both
     in energy and financial services, and is a welcome addition to our
     team.  In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs
     groups and strategy in Washington, the Federal Regulatory Affairs
     group under Joe Hartsoe's direction will also report to Linda.  Joe
     Hartsoe will also retain primary responsibility for NERC activities,
     although Charles Yeung and Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line
     reporting relationship to Jim Steffes in his capacity of directing our
     activities for ENA.  Ray Alvarez will be transferring from his current
     role with Transredes in Bolivia during the 1st quarter of 2001 and
     will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group, reporting to Joe
     Hartsoe.

     On a personal note, I would like to acknowledge the significant
     contributions that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his
     eighteen years of service.  Joe's work ethic, intellect, and integrity
     have established Enron as a company that is respected throughout
     Washington.  I will have more to say about this as Joe's retirement
     draws closer, but I look to him to be a vital part of the leadership
     transition in our Washington office that will occur over the next days
     and weeks.

I will be relying heavily on the above-identified six individuals to ensure
that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating
companies; that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business
strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future; and,
most importantly, to thoroughly understand how our organization can
contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis.
Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the
Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide
execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals.

In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government
Affairs organization; the following changes are being made.

   In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of
   the EES group of companies, Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the
   rates/regulatory group, now renamed Government Affairs Support Services.
   This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services
   throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of
   expertise over the next months to some of the new markets that the
   company has and will soon be entering.  Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris
   will join this organization and report to Harry.
   Jeff Brown, Tom Delaney, Mary Hain, Ron McNamara, Christi Nicolay, Thane
   Twiggs, and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role
   supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets. Alberto
   Levy will be relocating from our Caracas, Venezuela office and will also
   report to Jim.  A couple of special mentions:  Jeff Brown has done an
   outstanding job in leading the CUBR (Coalition for Uniform Business
   Rules) process over the last year and his current leadership of the
   Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO efforts for Enron will be critical to the
   development of well functioning wholesale electric markets in the U.S.
   It is also my hope that Steve Walton will play an increased leadership
   role across North America on wholesale electric market issues.  The
   incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possesses of the electric
   industry, coupled with his industry-wide credibility, will provide much
   needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts across
   North America.
   Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in
   supporting the company's efforts at PJM.  Tom will also continue to be
   an organization-wide resource on technical issues regarding generation
   interconnection and distributed generation.  Kathleen Sullivan has
   recently joined Steve's group from Azurix and will be primarily
   assisting Howard Fromer in New York.
   Sue Nord will head up the group that supports EBS.  Scott Bolton and
   Donald Lassere, while reporting to Sue, will continue to provide
   leadership on telecommunications issues.  Scott and Donald have done
   outstanding work and will continue to be integral to our efforts in this
   area.
   Finally, the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process, beginning 1/1/01,
   will be extended to all of Government Affairs in North America,
   including Federal Government Affairs and Mexico.  The RCR Committee,
   beginning immediately, will be expanded and will consist of Harry
   Kingerski, Sue Nord,  Linda Roberston, Jim Steffes, Lisa Yoho & myself.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thank you

In case you haven't done it already, please cross out the note on your 
calendar that today is the day the Conoco trial starts!  What better day to 
announce a celebration of the settlement, since without it many of us would 
be sitting in a courtroom in Midland wondering whether the trial would last 3 
weeks or 30.   With that image firmly in mind, please plan on joining us for 
a celebratory dinner on Thursday, August 17th at 6:00 at Brennan's.  Again, 
thanks for all of your  efforts on this case, and I hope to see you on the 
17th!  DF

As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
"fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

Subject: Re: gouging  

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

I just had a good conversation with Sempra's regulatory person who is working 
on the data responses for Stephanie Katz.  Her name is Gillian Wright, and 
she is a "regulatory case manager" whatever that is.  She was pleased to hear 
about the extension til Wed 12:00 for her responses.  The best news is that 
she was a very chatty individual and was interested in our thoughts on the 
questions.  I told her that our answer no. 1 was just going to confirm that 
the recourse rate is in fact in our tariff where it is supposed to be and it 
is always "offered."  I suggested that her question no. 1 was a little 
different and to me, indicated that FERC just didn't understand the daily 
markets at all and further didn't understand very much about index to index 
deals and how they might be the best way to contract in many circumstances.  
She took that bait and said that their answer would focus on exactly 
that--that fixed rate deals create risk issues for trading companies that 
index deals lay off.  She also said that FERC's questions looked similar to 
questions Sempra Trading has had to answer on other deals and that she 
thought her answer would be similar.  I got a high comfort level that she 
viewed this whole thing as no big deal.  Are any of you aware of where Sempra 
may have been required to answer questions like these???  Kathy R:  have you 
seen any above-max index deals involving Sempra?  It may have been CPUC 
questions she was referring to, but I didn't want to make a big deal of it.

Gillian would like to get a fax of our responses to her at 213-244-8820 as 
soon as they are ready.  Susan and Maria please make sure we get that done.  
She said she'd send hers to us as soon as she could, but I didn't push for a 
draft to review as her thinking sounds consistent with ours.   

As for Sid, Scott Walker's regulatory guy won't be available until tomorrow 
morning.  Scott is having him call me then to discuss the answers.  Scott was 
appreciative of the extension, but frankly didn't sound like he planned to 
meet the Tuesday deadline anyway.  In fact, I'm not sure he cares all that 
much about meeting the new Wed. deadline.  DF

A perfected (or nearly perfected) ROW may have some merit, especially as ENA 
continues their negotiations to further develop that power plant in 
Albuquerque.  I'll have Jeff call ENA, and without giving anything away, find 
out how their negotiations are progressing.  I wonder to what extent Dennis' 
agreement with the tribe is transferable?

Subject: Pueblo

Tino called this morning with a quick report.  They are still negotiating 
with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.  The size of the 
plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.  Tino has been 
ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls 
apart.  He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it 
related to the pipeline right of way.  The have a binding 20 year agreement 
with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly 
payment.  I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the 
ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  The question is whether we 
are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis 
has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  I 
told Tino I'd give him a call next week to let him know.  At minimum, I'd 
suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they've got and 
advise us on what its worth.  Your thoughts?  DF

I've redlined the outline to address what I believe is the most important 
risk you guys will face out there:  the risk that FERC will listen to your 
presentation and conclude that the embedded optionality that some pipelines 
are currently offering in transport contracts is a negotiated term and 
condition and therefore must be stopped.  I think we need to tailor the 
presentation and filing to minimize the chance that FERC will take away 
flexibility we think we now have (i.e., the flexibility to embed shipper puts 
in transport contracts).   Even if the TW approach on unbundled options goes 
nowhere, several of the strategies we may want to implement next year depend 
on continued ability to sell embedded options.   Susan, Shelley,a nd MKM, I 
still think it is a good idea to push this proposal, but am concerned that 
FERC might squirrel and go the opposite direction we are trying to push 
them.  Your thoughts?  DF

Nancy, I've prepared the attached outline in response to FERC Staff's request 
that we provide "something in writing."  This is basically just a description 
of our proposal.  I've tried to keep it brief so that staff members are not 
reading while we're trying to talk to them.  It should be enough information 
to raise a lot of questions.

Please wait until Shelley or I give you the go-ahead to pass this along to 
the relevant Commission people; I'd like to give the other addressees the 
opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible.  

Everyone else:  please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to 
provide something to them tomorrow.

		 Subject: Re: Gallup Rebate

Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.  Article 6 of the 
Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) 
with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an 
automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading 
conditions on CDEC's system.  We had a pretty good idea when we signed the 
contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start 
date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to 
"assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same 
result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and 
expenses" associated with the manual system.  We will fight with them about 
who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to 
"assist" us in managing the cost.  In the mean time, we need to make sure 
that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to 
mitigate future costs.  Do we have someone who is watching this out there?  
We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to 
manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.  James 
had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I 
guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to 
us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.  That sounds like a 
BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we 
can figure out a solution.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: Gallup Rebate

Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression 
Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management.  My understanding 
was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order 
for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak 
load periods.  We have not received access to this information which has 
resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of 
July through September.  Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder 
of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.  This cost is 
averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have 
in August and September.

David Port, ETS is purchasing a trading system from Caminus to track their 
transactions.  Included in this system are position reports which the 
Accounting Department will be using to report and determine compliance with 
the attached policy and procedures, including open positions, VAR, MTM, 
approval limits, Greeks, credit risk, stress testing, basis positions, 
confirmations and invoicing.  The ETS Risk Management policy requires that 
our reporting conform to the corporate standards, accordingly your name was 
given to me as the person who could help direct some of the more technical 
reporting standards.

Caminus is doing an introduction to their system today from 12:00 am to 3 pm 
in 49c2, however I know you will not be back in town until next week.  Vernon 
Mercaldo is coordinating the installation of the system and will be needing 
your input relating to Corporate reporting standards.  As the project 
progresses he will be contacting you.

Attached are drafts of the ETS Policy and Procedures.

Either I didn't fully understand the December Texas Eastern order or else 
FERC has just put a new and unhelpful spin on it.  The Thursday rehearing 
order dramatically changes how the "shipper must have title" rule applies to 
acquisitions of upstream capacity.   I thought the Dec. order pretty clearly 
allowed a pipe to acquire upstream capacity and then resell that capacity 
under the acquiring pipeline's rate schedules.  FERC specifically held that  
the "shipper must have title" policy won't be applied if the acquiring pipe 
treats the acquired capacity "as though it were part of its own system".  (p. 
61,886)  The Dec. order even cited TW's acquisition of park n ride capacity 
from PG&E as an example of the type of transaction that (I thought) could be 
done without advance Commission approval.   Now, FERC explains that it did 
not intend a "blanket waiver" of the shipper must have title policy.   Pipes 
can still acquire upstream capacity without advance FERC permission, but only 
if the acquiring pipe is going to use the acquired capacity for operational 
needs or to resell under the selling pipe's release mechanism.  If the 
acquiring pipe wants to use the acquired capacity to support sales of service 
under the acquiring pipe's rate schedules, a specific waiver of the "must 
have title" policy is required (see FN 20 and text).   We are right back to 
where we started.  I guess the orders signal that FERC is  much more likely 
to grant waivers of the "must have title" policy than in the past, but I 
don't think we are good to go to acquire upstream storage, for example, and 
resell it as FDD or IDD until we get permission first.  

Shelley--let me know if you hear any expressions of outrage from other 
pipes.  This might be worth chasing on rehearing since it is such a clear 
about face by FERC.

The whole thing also bugs me on an intuitive level, but I'm not sure it is a 
legal conflict of interest.  The Northern cases he is involved in are not 
really  "GISB matters."  There are certainly issues like the 637 compliance 
issue that involve GISB standards, however.  GISB is a freestanding entitity 
and his representation does not equate to representation of Enron so he could 
claim that his only client interest to worry about is GISB itself.  As long 
as he does not take positions in Northern cases that are inconsistent with 
what GISB wants, he's technically OK.  I suspect he'd argue that his work in 
the Northern docket is completely consistent with GISB's objective of 
achieving world domination.  This was my from the hip analysis when Jay first 
showed up in our cases, so I may have missed something.  For example, I'm not 
really clear on GISB's structure.  Can we argue that it is not a real stand 
alone entity but rather  a "front" for a cooperative group of companies that 
includes Enron?  If so, we might have a real conflict.  Thanks. DF

Subject: Supplemental NDG Comments in RM98-10

I was impressed that NDG filed revised comments in RM98-10 correcting their 
earlier mis-statements that GISB had ratified imbalance netting and trading 
standards.  The revised 2 page NDG filing states that GISB has not yet 
ratified the standards.
Then I noticed who signed the pleading -- Jay Costan.  I guess he ought to 
know, as he is GISB general counsel!

Does anyone else find this to be a conflict of interest for him to be GISB 
general counsel & then be counsel of a customer taking a position against a 
pipeline in a GISB matter.  I like Jay a lot, but I'm thinking of clarifying 
our understanding of his outside representation while he is GISB general 
counsel.

Subject: Commission Adopts New Rules for OCS Pipelines


At the meeting this morning, the Commission issued new regulations under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for Pipelines on the Outer Continental 
Shelf (RM99-5). 

In a nutshell, the rules add new reporting requirements for offshore pipes  
in order to level the playing field with offshore pipelines that are 
regulated under the Natural Gas Act.  

In an important change from the NOPR, the rule exempts from these new 
requirements offshore pipelines that are already regulated under NGA (i.e. 
there will not be dual reporting requirements).

Commissioner Breathitt explained that while this is a modest step and doesn't 
address all OCS issues, she feels like this  provides a light-handed 
regulatory alternative for regulating offshore pipes.

The note below was a portion of Terry Galassini's Weekly Report.  I wasn't 
sure if either of you have been a part of the test information.


**Gallup Compressor Station & Mainline Expansion
A field test was completed and initial results indicate a compressor 
efficiency around 80 - 82% which is within Cooper's guarantee.  A not to 
exceed cost of $3 Million was provided to Marketing for station modifications 
to facilitate an incremental mainline (West of Thoreau) firm capacity of 10 
MMcf/d.    Additional work by E&C to fine tune the not to exceed estimate is 
targeted for completion by December 8th.  The mainline expansion potential is 
directly related to Gallup since the discharge pressure must be increased to 
970 psig to achieve an additional 10 MMcf/d on the mainline.  The San Juan 
Lateral firm capacity would remain at 850 MMcf/d.

Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law 
bullets this morning.  A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and 
Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).  LG&E's 
gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into 
Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.   Rockey 
and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good 
arguments for avoiding the liability.  The unexpected (and unmetered) 
deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance 
during the referenced 3 month period.  Accordingly, I assume the cost of 
replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should 
not affect earnings.   I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this 
matter.  DF

Subject: Fossum news rocks Enron stock


I trust you guys saw this on the wires today:

Enron's stock was off $3-3/16 or 4.1 percent in afternoon trading at $74, 
following an announcement that Jeff Skilling will become its new chief 
executive officer on Feb. 12. An analyst, who asked not to be named, said 
that it had been widely assumed that Drew Fossum would be named CEO; 
therefore, the company's stock traded lower on the news.

We need to make sure this upside doesn't get taken in 2000.  It is part of 
the 2001 plan.  What ideas do we have for reserving equivlaent dollars?  the 
TC swap? depending on the outcome of the Carlton order, we may have a couple 
hundred thousand there?  we need to discuss how we want this treated for when 
it gets to Rod-  MK

Subject: Re: SSL Abandonment - Sale to El Paso  

I had a meeting with El Paso the afternoon of Nov. 6th to discuss the 
abandonment, and the "next steps"

El Paso agrees to shoot for a November 30, 2000 close, with them assuming 
commercial and revenue responsibility on December 1st.  I requested funds 
transfer to NNG on the first business day of Jan 2001.

All exhibits to the P&SA are collected and being made available to legal for 
incorporation into closing documents.  These include MMS ROW's, space lease 
agreements on  three platforms, and a surviving NNG/Sea Gull transport 
agreement.

Robert Newman with EGC has contacted El Paso field operations and they have 
developed a list of information operations will transfer to El Paso regarding 
pipeline Ass Builts, maintenance information,. metering activity, MMS safety 
inspections, corrosion control, leak histories, etc.

Preliminary worksheet showing the "Adjusted Price" was developed and agreed 
to with El Paso.  Estimate of proceeds at the time of closing will be 
$1,357,107.00.  This was developed using estimates for the last three months 
revenue stream, and four month of O&M.  The final number will be developed 
and routed internally once actual variable are known.  Due to the transition 
to SAP, queries be expense code are more difficult to obtain.

If you should have any questions or need any information please let me know.

Thanks, Bob

Leslie Lawner called and asked if TW could help with the funding of this 
organization.  As you will recall, the "NM First" group has taken positions 
on right of way issues that are consistent with TW/Enron's view on Indian 
right of way issues.  Leslie asked if we could kick in $1000.  I leave this 
to you guys to weigh in on--If you think it's worthwhile, let me know and one 
of us can get back to Leslie.  I'm happy to help out with the funding if you 
think it would be useful.  DF

Drew;
Thanks for sending me off to read the order in CP99-522, etc.? I've  gotten a 
good feel for the relevant TW issues. 
Based on our preliminary information, TW looks attractive as the supply  
source for the Wikieup project.? 
?
FYI: I've discussed the project a couple of times with Jeff Fawcett, and he  
promised a first cut estimate? of facilities costs on this (as well as  
another) project, and suggested that it would be done by early March. 
Currently,  however, he seems to be among the missing (not returning phone 
calls,  etc.)? Maybe you could call over there and help me get his 
attention??  I'd sure like to make some progress on this deal.
?
Thanks for your help.
Regards,
GB

I'm told that the four states conducting the inquiry into UtiliCorp's gas 
purchases and capacity release methodologies have a conference call with 
UtiliCorp on Friday.

UCU has admitted an "accounting error" to Michigan and has offered a $100,000 
refund.  The PSC is looking for something more in the area of $20 million.

You remember that Nick Schwartz was in Lansing the same day we were last 
month giving a deposition.  Although it was supposed to be on another subject 
it quickly turned to this issue. A copy of the deposition is attached below.

I suspect that the answer lies in Mary Kay Miller's or Julia White's areas, 
or both.  Mary Kay and Julia, who is the best person to go to to find the 
monthly sales MDQ from 88 through the end of the merchant service?  I suspect 
that Glen or Bob could point us toward the monthly aggregate purchase data 
during that same period (Britt--wasn't this was provided in discovery prior 
to the first trial?).  I think we are still working on the %Mertzon purchases 
were of the total--Kathy Ringblom please grab me in the morning on this.  
Thanks all.  DF

When they were in Ponca City, Michael Keenan of EconOne (our damages
experts) advised Jeff and Caren that they need the following info.: 1)
monthly figures for system-wide firm entitlement (what our customers were
purchasing from 1988 until we stopped selling). If different from these
figures, then we also need monthly figures for total system-wide purchases;
and 2) monthly figures for deliveries of gas to the Mertzon plant. Please
let us know who we should contact to pull this together. Also, did we ever
get any word back on the question of what % of the total gas Northern was
purchasing the gas behind the Mertzon plant represented?

Not having received the request,  it seems like the quantity related to the 
contract would provide them better info than a contact name and phone 
number-  did they specifically ask for that inf0??  upon answer, work 
directly with Drew as I'll be out.   MK

In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list 
of Transwestern's "major" shippers to California with contact names and phone 
numbers.  I've defined "major" as anyone with total firm contracts of 
25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Thanks,
Lindy

Endesa Receives Green Light to Move into France
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Endesa (NYSE: ELE), Spain's largest power utility, has signed an agreement
with Charbonnages de France (CDF) to acquire a 30-percent interest in the
French electricity generator Societe Nationale d'Electricite et de Thermiqu=
e
(SNET). The transaction has been authorized by the French Government. The
agreement includes Endesa's right to increase its interest in SNET in the
medium term in order to strengthen the cooperation between both companies
and allow Endesa to carry out its industrial development plan in France
and Europe.

ANALYSIS: The approval for Endesa to acquire 30-percent interest in SNET
cements the company's move into France, which is a major component in the
aggressive expansion efforts Endesa has been implementing this year. SNET,
while a comparatively small company by American standards, is still the
second largest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity=
,
and third largest in terms of electricity generation. SNET owns five coal
plants totaling 2,600 megawatts, which generate about 6,838 GWh annually.
This is a very low output, and in fact SNET accounts for only 2.5 percent
of the market share in France. However, given the fact that France's larges=
t
energy company, EDF, still has a hold on about 90 percent of the market
in the country, any acquisition of the next-largest company is a major
coup. The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of
the company's experience in coal-based electricity=01*which still is the po=
wer
source for roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continent=01=
*and
its progressiveness in terms of technology.

Presently, SNET sells the bulk of its electricity output to EDF under a
long-term contract between the two companies. The rest of its generation
is sold to eligible customers. In addition to its current assets, SNET
is also planning a new 350-MW gas-fired station in eastern France and is
the front runner to build a new clean-coal plant in the heavily industriali=
zed
Rhone Valley. Thus, as France slowly opens its market to competition, SNET
could emerge as one of the major providers. Endesa was able to beat out
other bidders for SNET, including France's Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux and
Germany's RWE, due to the positive valuation of Endesa's industrial and
commercial projects and the economic value of its offer.

Endesa already entered the French market last month with a three-year=20
exclusive
agreement to serve the energy needs of SEB, a small appliance company.
The company's move outside of Spain resulted from several factors. First,
the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the domestic growth of
its largest electric companies, essentially land-locking the domestic growt=
h
of companies like Endesa and forcing them to look outward for growth=20
opportunities.
In addition, growth in countries like France and Germany is probably appeal=
ing
to Endesa because their central location offers additional expansion=20
opportunities
into Italy and Eastern Europe. Just within the last year, privatization
has come to the major European countries=01*either all at once, as in the
case of Germany, or in forced increments, as occurred in France. There
has been little question that Endesa would like to develop generation=20
interests
across the Continent, and has taken advantage of competitive opportunities
as they have emerged. In fact, Endesa disclosed that it plans to become
a leading European power player through the swap of assets with other=20
electricity
customers and through acquisitions. Rumor has it that Endesa is also lookin=
g
to acquire the generation assets of Enel=01*Italy's state-owned power and
the biggest European rival to EDF.

However, as Endesa expands abroad it continues to face significant problems
in Spain, due mostly to its proposed merger with the second largest=20
electricity
provider in the country, Iberdrola. Just last month, Endesa announced that
it had entered into a "friendly merger" with Iberdrola. Together, the two
companies will gain a hold over 80 percent of Spain's power market with
a combined market capitalization of the equivalent to $32 billion. Reported=
ly,
the merger will create the world's third-biggest electricity company, after
Tokyo Electric Power and Enron. However, Spanish oil company Repsol, which
lost out on the bid for Iberdrola to Endesa, continues to contemplate renew=
ing
a hostile takeover of the company. Repsol claims that it in fact offered
1.2 more euros per share than what Endesa has promised to pay for Iberdrola
in their $13 billion merger, but that Iberdrola did not even consider the
bid. Both Endesa and Repsol are partially owned by the Spanish government
(only 33 percent of Endesa is publicly traded), so presently negotiations
are being held to see if a compromise can be reached. Reportedly, the merge=
r
between Endesa and Iberdrola can occur only if some of the companies belong=
ing
to the merged company are sold, as per the Spanish antimonopoly legislation=
.
Ironically, this could benefit Repsol as the company plans to invest in
any companies that are divested due to the merger.

France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy
liberalization across the Continent. In fact, France has only opened its
power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the European Union.
While other European countries have opened 100 percent of their markets
to competition, France has opted for a phased-in approach, opening a third
each of its power and gas markets by February 2003 and August 2008,=20
respectively.
Thus, although Endesa is certainly pushing through barriers to obtain entry
into France, it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the
country. A report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency, issued
just last week, contends that France's power liberalization law restricts
power trading and allows EDF to keep its market advantages.

However, even though Endesa may face expansion limitations in France, it
is important to remember how large the company is in its home country.
Endesa produces about half of Spain's electricity (22,500 MW), relying
mainly on nuclear and coal-fired plants. Looking to diversify, Endesa also
owns interests in gas, water, and telecommunications companies. It is the
largest shareholder in Auna, a jointly owned company (with partners Telecom
Italia and Uni?n Fenosa) that controls Retevisi?n, Spain's second-largest
phone company, behind Telef?nica. In addition, Endesa is also investing
heavily in energy firms in Latin America. Thus, although France is very
important for Endesa's European expansion efforts, the company is still
a contender in other key markets.

Below is a copy of the Order lifting the $250/Mwh hard price cap for 
California ISO/PX.
FERC has also posted a notice of a  Dec. 15 special mtg. re the investigation 
into the California market last summer.
Various Enron units continue to receive informal data requests from FERC 
staff regarding current California gas/electric 
Steve Kean has asked that all inquiries be coordinated through Sarah Novosel 
in the DC office.
Leslie Lawner is preparing Enron's response to the SDG&E emergency petition 
to put a cap on gas sales.
 





              COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA 
                            ELECTRICITY MARKETS

          In response to emergency conditions that exist in the
     California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages
     and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
     today approved a price cap change requested by the California
     Independent System Operator (ISO).   The Commission also took
     steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full
     capacity.

          The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. 
     Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the
     clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase
     price cap.  This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic
     supply shortages.  
          
          Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their
     bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost
     information.  

          The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in
     1998.  The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well
     as other market participants.   The ISO operates and controls
     most of the transmission system in California.

          In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission
     also authorized the ISO to penalize participating generators that
     refuse to operate in response to an ISO request in an emergency.  
     They will be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price
     the ISO paid for energy for each hour in which the participating
     generator failed to respond.   

          The ISO's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the
     purchase price cap or through out-of-market dispatches will be
     assigned to scheduling coordinators who depend too much on spot
     markets.

          The Commission's second order enables QF entities to
     generate at full capacity which in the past could have caused
     them to lose QF status.  QF generators are small power producers
     that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and
     cogenerators that produce both electricity and steam for
     commercial use.   

          The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a
     California QF.

          The orders are effective immediately.

          To view the Commission orders in full go to "What's New" at
     www.ferc.fed.us.

You probably need to look at this.This only addresses expenditure approval 
and does not address "execution" authority. Sometimes non VPs believe that if 
they can approve the expenditure then they can sign contracts in connection 
with the expenditure even in the absence of a power of attorney. Accordingly 
it might be wise to expand the "Delegation" section of this policy.

Subject: Project EWE ll - possible joint bid

It it becomes desirable to structure the Reliant deal off balance sheet, we 
would most likely need a partner, either an industry participant or a 
financial entity.  Some potential industry partners might include Nisource, 
Utilicorp, or Oneok.  (are there others?)  

According to the press, Nisource will need to pay down debt following the 
Columbia merger.  However they have a continuing strategic appetite for LDC 
assets.  They are/will be a registered Utility Holding Company, so obviously 
PUHCA poses no concern for them.  

Here is a possible structure for an Enron/Nisource JV purchase of the Reliant 
package.  Other Nisource and /or Columbia assets could be added to the 
transaction to generate net excess cash for Nisource (presumeably only if ENE 
had a strategic interest in the added assets).

Comments please.

I found the reference I was remembering over the weekend.  Check out the 
order issued to TriState Pipeline at Docket CP99-61.  FERC got all over CMS 
on the problems posed by "dual jurisdictional facilities" whatever that 
means.  CMS tried to do something that sounds a lot like what PNM would be 
doing under the idea you guys had.

Interesting.  Assuming we could satisfy the Texas Eastern criteria (which 
would be tough given that this is a firm service, unlike our market center 
service), we still need to think about PNM's situation.  The letter says they 
are a Hinshaw.  This deal would seem to blow their Hinshaw exemption.  There 
is some new law on use of capacity on a Hinshaw for interstate service, only 
I think it involved a capacity lease instead of service agreements.   I think 
it was one of the Northeast pipeline cases involving CMS.  Does PNM know that 
we would use their service for interstate transportation?  If we can crack 
the Hinshaw issue, this might be worth a shot.  DF

Subject: TW acquisition of capacity on PNM

The Commercial Group has been discussing with PNM the possibility of entering 
into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of PNM's system 
between Blanco and Rio Puerco.  This would effectively operate as an 
expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would 
acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post 
other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from 
Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at 
this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide 
short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate 
that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on 
TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by 
shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers 
wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide 
service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B.  

In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish 
TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more 
specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific 
pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's 
constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other 
pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet 
all the Texas Eastern criteria.

I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with 
any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a 
letter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point 
for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our 
successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will 
include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of   
"Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service 
Company of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the 
Blanco receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for 
acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. 
___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
services."

After you've reviewed the attached, please let me know your overall 
substantive comments and let's talk about the best way to proceed.  Thanks.

Subject: Capacity Options on TW

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

$2.5MM SAP accrual which I will use to offset the increase in the Corp 
charges for this year instead of charging to the pipelines.

$5.0 -$6.0MM I hope to be able to carry over to next year.  It depends on the 
$ some costs really come in at.  We did some things in the second quarter to 
hold income back.  I can't  really reverse this year.  If our GPG target does 
go up to $401MM, I will have a $35 MM hole at my level.

I wrote off business development projects and some other things.

The inventory deal is still up in the air.  Rod will know more tomorrow.

At this point in time, even if it happens higher, we will still have a hole.

Maybe they can try the structured products???

Tracy,

Can you tell me what the ($10.2) for Enron Pipeline Company is in the 3CE 
(primarily in Q1 & Q2)?  That seems to be creating the remaining GPG hole for 
the year.

Our officers had been counting on having more reserves to carry into 2001 to 
help fill the NNG and TW gaps.  I also heard from Bob that the inventory deal 
may still be viable at a higher amount - more like $20MM.  Do you have any 
updates on that?

Thanks,  Elaine

PG&E Sues to Recover $3 Billion 

Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday 
filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling 
that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in 
uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May 
when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned 
utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 
levels. 

The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, 
therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to 
the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public 
Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover 
its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit 
charge. 

"We're just keeping our legal options open," said a San Francsco-based 
utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect 
its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
another California utility on a "rating negative watch." 

State and federal officials all acknowledge as part of a series of ongoing 
investigations that California's current wholesale electricity market is 
broken and noncompetitive in its current state, said Roger Peters, senior 
vice president and general counsel for Pacific Gas and Electric. "However, 
there has not yet been any concrete action by regulators to provide for 
recovery of the costs we have incurred to purchase the power our customers 
must have, either through refunds from power sellers who charged unfair 
prices, or through retail rates. These costs are continuing to grow." 

Noting both the unfairness and unpopularity of the skyrocketing wholesale 
charges, PG&E's utility nevertheless said it has a legal right to recover the 
charges from its almost four million customers, and it reiterated five steps 
it has taken to "increase supply, moderate customer demand, repair the broken 
wholesale market and provide stable, reasonable rates."

Did Bill Cordes talk to you yesterday about the start date for me to move to 
his area?  He had mentioned to me about training with Virginia this week and 
possibly starting next week but that was before he talked with you.  Bill did 
not mention to Virginia what was decided on this and she just called me to 
see what I know.  I told her I would talk with you about it as Bill's is out 
of town for two days.

Thanks...........
