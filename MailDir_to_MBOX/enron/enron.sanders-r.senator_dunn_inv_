Bob:
You asked us to determine whether there are defects on the face of the
subpoena served upon EES which may prevent its enforcement in superior
court.  Assuming the court  holds the subpoena to the standard of a
"deposition subpoena" - and we think it should - it is defective in at least
two respects.  First, it was not served upon Enron by personal service as
required by CCP ?2020(f).  Second, Government Code ?1189 provides that the
Attorney General must first file a petition in superior court to require the
custodian of records to appear and testify. While the subpoena requests a
deposition of the Enron EES custodian of records, the AG did not file such a
petition. In addition, Government Code ?1185 provides that  a person served
with such a subpoena is not obliged to attend as a witness if he or she does
not reside or do business within 50 miles of the court in which he or she is
asked to appear.
At your request we are now researching and will draft over the weekend a
memorandum to address three issues arising from this subpoena:  (1) whether
EES has substantive grounds to refuse to comply with the subpoena or to
disqualify the AG from enforcing it  (2) whether EES may successfully remove
any compliance proceeding brought by the AG to federal court; and (3) the
consequences to EES if it should be held in contempt for refusal to comply.
A discussion of the defects in the EES subpoena follows:
There are three defects in the subpoena  served on Enron Enery Services
("EES") on May 25, 2001, pursuant to California Government Code section
11180-11189.  The subpoena purports to require EES to produce its custodian
of record on June 25, 2001, to "testify and to answer questions" and to
"produce documents responsive to the document requests."  (Subpoena at
2:1-5).  Accordingly, its demands are in the nature of a subpoena for
deposition and we analyze it on this basis.
1.	Defective Service
		The subpoena appears defective because it was served by mail
instead of personal service.  Service of a deposition subpoena pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure section 2020(f) requires that the
subpoena be served personally, not by mail.  For the reasons discussed
below, we believe that the subpoena served on EES is deposition subpoena
subject to the personal service requirements of C.C.P. ? 2020(f).
		First, the subpoena is a deposition subpoena because it
seeks to compel oral testimony from EES's custodian of records.  The method
of taking oral testimony in California outside of court is by way of
deposition.  C.C.P. ? 2002, et seq.  Here, the subpoena commands EES'
custodian of records "to testify and to answer questions."  (Subpoena at
2:1).  It also states that the custodian of records "will be questioned
under oath regarding methods of compliance and whether all documents
described in this subpoena have been produced."  (Subpoena at 7:5).
Moreover, the subpoena is issued "pursuant to the powers conferred by
California Government Code sections 11180-11189...".  Government Code
section 1189 is entitled "Depositions;  petition;  order;  enforcement"
(emphasis supplied).  The subpoena should thus properly be considered a
deposition subpoena.
		Second, the requirements of the California Code of Civil
Procedure governing deposition subpoenas applies to the subpoena served on
EES.  Government Code section 11185 provides that in the case of deposition
subpoenas, the deposition is governed by the California Code of Civil
Procedure.  The Attorney General has also issued a formal opinion stating
that the Code of Civil Procedure governs subpoenas issued pursuant to Gov.
Code ? 11180:
				Presumably [Gov. Code ? 11180] authorizing
the head of the Department to issue a subpoena for the production of books,
papers, or documents would be governed by the general law relating to
subpoenas duces tecum. (see Sec. 1985, C.C.P).

9 Attorney General's Opinions 35, Opinion No. 46-341;  see also, 11 Attorney
General's Opinions 66, Opinion No. 48-21 (service of subpoena pursuant to
Gov. Code ? 11184 must comply with Code of Civil Procedure ? 410).

		Because the subpoena is a deposition subpoena subject to the
Code of Civil Procedure, the requirement that it be served personally, not
by mail, should apply.

2.	The Subpoena is Defective Because the Attorney General Failed to
First File a Petition in Superior Court and Obtain a Court Order Requiring
the Custodian of Records to Appear and Testify

		Government Code section 11189 provides:

				In any matter pending before a department
head, the department head may cause the deposition of persons residing
within or without the state to be taken by causing a petition to be filed in
the Superior Court in the County of Sacramento reciting the nature of the
matter pending, the name and residence of the person whose testimony is
desired, and asking that an order be made requiring the person to appear and
testify before an officer named in the petition for that purpose.

The Attorney General, while purporting to serve the subpoena pursuant to
this section ("Pursuant to the powers conferred by California Government
Code section 11180-11189..."), failed to comply with Government Code section
11189 by first filing a petition and obtaining a court order permitting the
taking of testimony.  For this reason, the subpoena should be considered
defective.

3.	The Supoena is Defective for Purporting to Compel Attendance by the
Custodian of Records at a Location More than Fifty Miles from His Residence


		Government Code section 11185 provides:

				a person is not obliged to attend as a
witness in any matter under this article at a place out of the county in
which he resides, unless the distance is less than 50 miles from his place
of business.  (emphasis supplied).

The subpoena is addressed to EES's custodian of records, and is "issued
primarily for the purpose of having [EES], through your most knowledgeable
person" testify and produce documents.  (Subpoena at 2:4-6).  Presumably,
EES's custodian of records who is most knowledgeable with respect to the
documents requested in the subpoena resides more than 50 miles from San
Francisco.  If so, the subpoena would be defective, and EES's custodian of
records would not be obliged to attend as a witness.

On June 27, 2001 we met with David Parquet, a Vice President with Enron
North America, in the offices of Enron Corp located at 101 California St.,
San Francisco. in order to learn whether there might be confidential Enron
Corp or Enron Wholesale Services documents responsive to the "Dunn"
subpoenas (or threatened AG subpoenas) within that office.  Based on this
interview we conclude there likely are such documents. This is the summary
of our discussion:
*	David told us he  works for Enron North America through its
Wholesale Services business. Personnel from four or five Enron entities work
out of the San Francisco office. These entities are:  Enron North America
(Parquet and his team, which deal with construction and siting of energy
facilities), Mike McDonald (another Enron VP and his team, which deals more
with Wholesale Services); Enron Corp (through Regulatory Affairs personnel
which include Sue Mara, Jeff Dasovich and Mary Shane); EES,  and Enron
Broadband Services (one person).
*	David  is responsible for power plant development in the west for
Enron North America.  This includes the siting, development, permitting,
etc. for projects in Las Vegas, Washington State and all over California.
David also was on the board of  ISO.
*	Mike McDonald deals with long term wholesale contracts. David
thought he and his team would  have documents relating to forward positions
and contracts. David described several deals he thought  they had done in
conjunction with Enron Wholesale personnel located in Portland. There are
three to four analysts in the office who would also have similar
information.
*	David thought several persons in the  San Francisco office had
access to pricing curves. He thought it likely that pricing information in
Houston was often accessed by some San Francisco personnel and probably
preserved on hard drives.  He also identified "hot sheets" which list
current deals and "how much money is made"; general corporate mailings; ISO
books and David's notes on ISO board meetings.  Included in these documents
may be information on sales to DWR by either Enron Wholesale or EES which
may potentially include pricing information.
*	As far as David knows, all personnel in the San Francisco office use
e-mail from Lotus Notes servers which may be administered through a server
in Houston.  However, there is a separate San Francisco server. All e-mail
is routed through this server and it may store e-mail and data received from
Houston.
*	David and others in the office know about the investigation by
Dunn's committee. I told him we had been told by the AG's office that they
were about to serve Enron Corp with a subpoena for documents, but so far we
had not learned they had done so. He asked for guidance about what he and
others in his office should do with respect to existing documents and
e-mails on their hard drives.  I asked him to preserve what he had on his
hard drive for now and told him one of us would get back to him within the
couple days to discuss this further.

As I reported to you from Irvine on Friday, I attended the hearing conducte=
d by Senator Dunn in Irvine, California. It was sound bite city, with no go=
od press for any generator or marketer.  At the outset of the hearing Sen D=
unn stated that his committee had been in lengthy discussions regarding con=
fidentiality issues with the generators, without success, and that they wou=
ld be sending out subpoenas for records starting on Monday(today) and that =
the production of documents from Cal ISO was to start last Friday.  Sen Dun=
n spent much of the day making his public record , posturing about the diff=
iculty of getting any documents from any generator or marketer because of c=
laims of confidentiality, and how unresponsive FERC has been. He got the FE=
RC lawyer, Robert Pease, to testify that any confidentiality afforded to th=
e bid data at Cal ISO under the FERC tariff would end after 6 months. As yo=
u undoubtedly read, the PUC chairwoman had nothing good to say about the ge=
nerators. Since the subpoenas will probably be forthcoming shortly, do we w=
ant to have a conference call of the group to discuss what transpired at Fr=
iday's hearing ? I am interested in knowing  how everyone intends to procee=
d in response to any subpoenas from the Committee,particularly after the fa=
iled efforts with the protective order. Please call me if we have not talke=
d by phone when you get this.

I spoke with another partner in our firm whose wife is a former partner of
Joe Dunn's.  Another report that Joe is very long on show and short on hard
work.  The circumstances under which he left the Robin Caplin firm were not
favorable.  Joe is very well connected, having spent most of his time
networking.   There is the possibility that there are some things in Joe's
past that he is not particularly proud of.  He is a politician and anything
that will promote his career, he will use.  Said differently, he talks a
great game but is probably marginal on the legal issues.

Gary--As I recall, we agreed to permit necessary repairs but for the repair

Rich,
 I just received a phone call from the IT department at EPMI.  They
have two computers which require immediate maintenance.  The first is a
desktop of an individual who sits at the front desk.  Her work station is
inoperable and part of the fix may be to format the hard drive.  Second,
there is a laptop for someone who is not a trader, which will not boot.  In
order to repair that machine, they may have to format the hard drive as
well.  At the present time, there is no easy way to copy the contents of the
hard drive before those machines are repaired, because they are inoperable.

 Based on our prior discussions, it is my understanding that for
operational needs such as these, EPMI is free to repair these machines
notwithstanding the request for preservation of data.

 If for any reason you have a different understanding, please let me
know immediately.

Sincerely,
Gary Fergus

One of my partners, David Schrader, was opposite Joe Dunn for four years in
litigation in Southern California.  He tells me that Joe's strength is his
presentation -- low key, sincere, effective in deposition, good with Judges.
However, he is not rated as being all that smart.  He still maintains an
office with Mark Robinson, a prominent heavy hitter plaintiffs' lawyer in
Southern California.  During this litigation, he was the coordinating
counsel for the plaintiffs in the breast implant litigation.  Thus, he is
very well connected to the plaintiffs bar and they probably funded part of
his campaign.  David believes that Dunn aspires to higher offices.

One other partner, Greg Williams, reports that he knows Joe Dunn very well.
I will report as soon as I have spoken with  him.

Thanks
Gary

As we discussed on yesterday's conference call, the following attorneys are
experts on the California Public Records Act, which is the applicable Act
for retrieving information from the California Legislature.  The first two
names were provided by the California Newspaper Association (Enron was not
mentioned) and the third name comes from our associate Mark Harris.  We
often work with the fourth attorney on other issues and he does have some
experience in this area however he should be used primarily if the other
attorney's do not work out.

As most people are aware, there are a variety of proceedings and investigations pertaining to the western wholesale power markets.  More than 50 market participants are involved in litigation on both the state and federal level.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been singled out in any of these investigations.  

Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and comply with our data retention policies.  These policies are not new.  I have previously sent out e-mails delineating our policy.  This e-mail simply serves as a reminder.  

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.


The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Now that we have a (tentative) August 27 hearing date on the AG/EES subpoena, that are several issues that need to be decided in connection with the EES subpoena:

     1.  Do we file a cross motion seeking to disqualify Lockyer and his deputy?  I think we should, and see no reason to wait.
     2.  Do we agree to a confidentiality order that allows the AG to share documents with other state AGs?  Richard, this is up to you.  We were against it, but Mike Kirby believes it could help with the litigation concerning the Dunn Committee subpoena.
     3.  Do we begin producing EES California documents before the August 27 hearing?  Mike, this is up to you.  Just let me know.

I think that's it for now.  Thanks for your help.

	Bob: You asked us to analyze our trial court and appellate tactics
in the face of the enforcement proceeding filed against EES by the AG
yesterday. My partner, Tom Peterson, drawing on the earlier work of Peter
Meringolo and Amanda Smith, looked at this issue yesterday afternoon and I
have discussed it with him. Here, briefly, is our initial analysis. The
bottom line: if EES decides to raise issues relating the confidentiality of
the documents and the bias of Lockyer in conjunction with the enforcement
action, it probably needs to file either a cross complaint or separate
action with the court to address to these issues.  Mike and I will call you
when we return from court this afternoon to discuss this further. A summary
of Tom's initial analysis follows.

     1.  Under Gov code section 11188, the AG  probably must file the
contemplated special proceeding to enforce the subpoena and obtain an order
compelling production before proceeding further.  Under section 11188, the
language ("shall") suggests there is no discretion about the issuance of the
order to show cause, which acts like a summons and probably only is
"adjudicatory" in the sense that it specifies dates by which the issues on
the petition will be joined.  See also Brovelli, 56 Cal.2d 524 (1961).
Therefore, we probably cannot object  to the proceedings today being
conducted before a Commissioner .  We probably can object if he refuses to
order a hearing before a superior court judge.

     2.  The limits of the review available  by the court concerning issues
raised by an enforcement action under section 11188  are unclear.  The
statute says that the court shall order compliance with the subpoena "[i]f
it appears to the court that the subpoena was regularly issued ...."  There
is case law suggesting, on the one hand, that this scheme "provides an
opportunity for adjudication of all claimed constitutional and legal rights
before one is required to obey the command of a subpoena duces tecum issued
for investigative purposes."  People v. West Coast, 10 Cal.App.3d at 470.
On the other hand, the court has no power to grant equitable remedies and a
party is not entitled to all of the protections by way of hearing and the
like that might be available by way of a motion to quash.  Fiedler, 23
Cal.App.3d at 40; see also Franchise Tax, 164 Cal.App.3d at 539.
	On the one hand, it would seem that we should be able to argue
territoriality objections--these seem jurisdictional and related to the
power of the AG.  On the other hand, we can't get any relief like a
declaration or an injunction, because that is equitable.  (This seems to
have been a major part of the reason that Reliant, etc., sued in a separate
action in LA, because they wanted to enjoin the AG from sharing the material
that they produced to the AG.)  Of course, if we can assert objections as
legal and constitutional reasons not to produce, we may not need equitable
relief, just an order finding that the administrative subpoena is not
"regularly issued" under the Gov Code scheme.    It is very unclear as to
whether  possible objection on the ground that the AG should be disqualified
could be considered by the court as part of the AG's enforcement action. One
might be able to argue that a lawfully constituted and conducted
investigation by a duly qualified officer is part of the calculation
implicit in "regularly issued...."  Conversely, a disqualification motion is
not within the contemplation of the immediate code sections surrounding
section 11188 and the court might consider this such a significant motion
that it would be reluctant to think it proper under the Gov Code scheme.

     3.  In view of 2, we may want to file an action for declaratory relief,
either because we really think that the section 11188 proceeding may not be
the proper vehicle to adjudicate our objections or because we want to take
away any issue for the AG who will probably assert that an enforcement
action under the government code permits only very narrow review.  We could,
therefore, file such an action and say that we are doing this because we
want to obviate any procedural issues and clear the path so we can get the
court to resolve all the disputes, and not have a piecemeal process.

     4.  Assuming we decide for whatever reason to file an action for
declaratory relief, we could file our own action, and try to get it joined
with the section 11188 proceeding, or we could consider filing a
cross-complaint in the section 11188 action.  The ability to do the latter
is debatable.  There is a well-recognized difference under the California
codes between an action and a special proceeding.  The Gov Code matter is a
special proceeding.  In Tide Water, the supreme court said that under the
then prevailing cross-complaint statute, a suit for special proceeding would
not support a cross-complaint, 43 Cal. 2d at 821.  However, the code has
since been amended and may permit a cross complaint for the following
reasons.  First, CCP section 428.10 now uses the word "action" in a border
sense.  It says a party may file a cross-complaint against any other party
who has filed a complaint against him.  It says that this does not authorize
a cross-complaint under section 1230.010--but that code section isn't an
"action" in the code sense but a special proceeding, so you can say the
meaning of the word "action" in the old section, construed by the supreme
court in Tide Water, has been completely changed, and the Legislature has
now expanded the definition to refer to a proceeding in court, whether an
"action" or a "special proceeding".  The AG will probably argue that the Gov
Code action is commenced by a petition, rather than a complaint, and thus
will not support a cross complaint- we would need to analyze this further.
Also in support of filing a cross-complaint under the new, amended code is
CCP section 426.60(a) which says that the compulsory cross-complaint rules
do not apply to special proceedings.  If the parts of the CCP applicable to
joinder did not otherwise apply to special proceedings, then there would not
be any reason to codify this carve out.  Finally, Tide Water says that the
court has discretion, based on "inherent power" (CCP section 187) to
entertain what would otherwise amount to an unauthorized cross-complaint
appended to a special proceeding.  (N.B. (a) Be aware that there is some
authority for the idea that parts of the CCP applicable to actions (Part 2)
do not apply to special proceedings unless expressly incorporated.  See
ALRB, 149 Cal.App.3d at 713; compare CCP 1109 [adopting "action" rules into
"special proceedings" of mandate, review, and prohibition].  (b) Be aware
that an action for declaratory relief is itself a special proceeding.

     In summary, we should consider responding to the AG's case with a
cross-complaint for declaratory relief or file one independently.  We'd lean
toward the cross-complaint and take our chances on a motion to dismiss it
procedurally, since we think the court would want to get all the issues
resolved.

     5.  There is a split of authority on whether the disposition of the
section 11188 proceeding is appealable.  I think it may be a distinction
without a practical difference, since a writ of mandate is available.  If we
want to seek appellate review of an order for us to produce, issued under
the Gov Code,  whether we proceed by appeal or writ of mandate/prohibition,
we would have to make a prompt filling and seek urgent relief and the issue
would come to a head that way: by the decision whether or not to defer
compliance while appellate review proceeds.

	This reports on our efforts to identify documents responsive to the
AG's subpoena to EES in California and Houston.

	California: Most hard copy documents have been retrieved from the
Costa Mesa office. Two lawyers will be at the San Ramon office this week to
complete the hard copy review there. They will complete the hard copy review
in Costa Mesa next week. We propose a limited review of the e-mail for four
or five EES officers during the following week. We will need clearance from
Bob to allow us to do so effectively. I understand that EES is now giving
notice to  customers that their contracts may be produced. This notice
should be completed soon so we can produce documents at or near the end of
July.
	 The following report, in Word format, from Peter Meringolo and
Amanda Smith, explains our proposed plan for the review and production of
California documents in detail. Please let us know if we should modify it.

 <<3@JLQ01!.DOC>>
	Houston: Last week I interviewed EES employees in Houston about
potentially responsive documents. My report on these interviews was sent to
you yesterday. While we will maintain our territoriality objections to the
subpoena, we should identify soon the documents in Houston which respond to
the following numbered categories of requests:

Nos. 2 and 3:  All contracts under which EES has purchased electricity on
the Western interconnection between 1998 and the end of 2003
No. 6.  Documents relating to the assessment of risks regarding:  the cost
of purchasing electricity in California
No. 7.  Documents relating to strategies or business plans designed to
minimize risks with regard to the cost of purchasing electricity necessary
to serve customers
No. 8.  Documents relating to decisions to return direct access customers to
default utility distributors in California, including documents relating to
cost savings
No. 9.  Communications relating to the return of direct access customers in
California

Rich,
 Thank you for the update.  I would like to speak to you today about
some other practical suggestions that we have relating to email handling.  I
also want to tell you about a situation that came up in the past few days.
In short, one employee's computer hard drive ran out of space related to the
do not delete directive.  We decided to have the employee move sufficient
files from the hard drive on to the network (so they would be backed up on
tape) and then authorized the employee to delete those files that had been
moved to create sufficient work space so that they could do their job.  We
anticipate that this issue may arise again and we intend to follow the same
procedure.

 I will call you to discuss these issues.

Thanks
Gary

Here is a suggested draft of a response to the deputy AG's letter. We plan
to send it tomorrow afternoon after we receive your comments.

Paul E. Stein, Deputy Attorney General
State of California
Office of the Attorney General
455 Golden Gate Avenue, Suite 11000
San Francisco, CA  94102
Dear Mr. Stein:
This responds to your letter of July 13, 2001, which I received on July 16,
regarding your discussions with Mike Kirby and me on behalf of Enron Energy
Services (EES).  This will confirm that you agreed that our discussions with
the Office of the Attorney General on the subject of its subpoenas served
upon EES are without prejudice to, and will not waive, any rights by EES to
object to either this investigation or the subpoenas in any subsequent
action or proceeding.  Your letter of July 13, 2001, notes some, but by no
means all, of EES's objections to the subpoenas.  Without attempting to
catalogue these objections, the following points in your July 13 letter
merit mention:
*	Confidentiality order:  This confirms we will provide you with a
suitable alternative confidentiality order for your review this week.
*	Customer notification:  EES has been, and continues to be in the
process of, providing appropriate notice to all commercial customers
(without regard for any other definition) in California with regard to your
request for their contracts.  We do not agree that our duty, if any, to
resist production under the terms of these contracts has been discharged.
*	Territoriality:  Our objections to your requests for out of state
documents and the testimony by out of state residents arises under
California statutes, common law, and California and the Constitution of the
United States.
*	Document repository:  We do not believe the Attorney General is
entitled to production of any documents other than at a central location.
*	Production:  Without waiving any of our objections to either the
Attorney General's investigation or the subpoena, EES is prepared to produce
documents which reside within California which are unambiguously called for
by the subpoena served on June 27, 2001, on the condition that we reach a
mutually acceptable confidentiality order to govern their production.
Assuming a mutually agreeable protective order, we are ready to begin doing
so on or about July 30.
Thank you for your courtesies in these matters.
Sincerely,
Michael E. Molland

> before):
>
> Legislative Committee Subpoena Power
>
> Government Code Section 9401, provides that "a subpoena requiring the
> attendance of any witness before the Senate, Assembly, or a committee may
> be issued by the President of the Senate, Speaker of the Assembly, or the
> chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is
> desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the
> respective house."
>
> There is a relative dearth of case law interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et
> seq. and the Govt. Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil
> Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas (C.C.P. 1985, et seq.).
> Therefore, it is possible that the provisions of both the Govt. Code and
> the C.C.P. will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena
> issued by a legislative committee.
>
> Govt. Code Section 9402 provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it "(a)
> states whether the proceeding is before the Senate, Assembly or a
> committee. (b) is addressed to the witness [presumably the custodian of
> records when documents are sought]. (c) requires the attendance of the
> witness at a time and place certain and (d) is signed by the President of
> the Senate, Speaker of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before
> whom attendance of the witness is desired."
>
> If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or "neglects or
> refuses ... to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper
> books, papers or document sin his possession or under his control, he has
> committed a contempt."  Govt. Code Section 9405.   If the contempt is
> committed while the Legislature is in session, Govt. Code Section 9407
> provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or
> Assembly "for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or
> Assembly."  If the Legislature is not in session, "the superior court in
> and for the county in which any inquiry, investigation hearing or
> proceeding [is] held ... may compel the ... production of books, papers,
> documents and accounts, as required by the subpoena issued by the
> committee, on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court
> asking that the witness be so compelled."
>
> Govt. Code Section 9409 provides that "any witness neglecting or refusing
> to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested...."  It is unclear how
> this provision would (or whether it could) be applied to a subpoena issued
> to the custodian of records of a non-resident company.
>
> Motion to Quash Subpoena
>
> California courts have held, under C.C.P. Section 1985, that a motion to
> quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a
> subpoena duces tecum.  See e.g. People ex rel. Dept. of Public Works v.
> Younger (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 575.  My research has revealed no case in
> which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by
> a motion to quash, but, as noted above, there appear to be only a very few
> cases interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et seq.   Therefore, it appears that a
> superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by
> a legislative committee (assuming that we want to take the risk of state
> court jurisdiction).
>
> In one early case, the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and
> accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate
> Committee were fatally defective.  Ex Parte McLain (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d
> 274.  In McLain, the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served
> upon Mr. McLain, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a
> subpoena calling for the production of various books, papers and
> documents.  Mr. McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer
> questions or produce the documents.  Upon representation of the Committee,
> the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr. McLain to produce the
> documents.  Mr. McLain again appeared before the Committee and again
> refused to produce the documents at which point, an affidavit was filed in
> Superior Court stating:
>
> "That, based upon evidence in its possession, the said Senate Interim
> Committee has determined that each of the books, papers, and documents
> specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now
> under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee, and the
> production of such books, papers and documents is necessary in order to
> enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties
> imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California
> pursuant to said Senate Resolution No. 162." and "That each of the books,
> papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to
> the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee
> and that the production of such books, papers and documents is necessary
> in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the
> duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of
> California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No. 162."
>
> The Superior Court found Mr. McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him
> committed to the sheriff until he produced the records.  The Court of
> Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because "a
> witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty
> of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and
> pertinency of the books and papers called for.  In cases of constructive
> contempt, as is this, not only the order but also the affidavit upon which
> it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the
> offense."  McLain at 276.
>
> This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting
> C.C.P. 1985, which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege
> material facts rather than conclusory statements.  See e.g. Grannis v.
> Board of Medical Examiners (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 551.
>
> However, cases interpreting C.C.P. 1985 also require the subpoena to
> demonstrate a level of specificity, materiality and relevance to be held
> proper.  See e.g. Pacific Auto Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 273
> Cal.App.2d 61.  It is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative
> committees are held to this same standard.
>
> What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued
> against the Enron' custodian of records, an out-of-state resident,
> intended to affect the production of out-of-state Enron documents?
>
>
> Here are the threshold questions:
>
> A.  Since we have found so few cases interpreting Govt. Code Section 9401,
> to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the
> same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending
> civil state court action?
>
> B.  Would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee
> subpoena make reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections governing
> subpoenas "generally" (i.e. C.C.P. 1985 et seq.) or those governing
> "deposition subpoenas" (i.e. C.C.P. 2020 et seq.)?  This is a toss-up and
> the answer may well be "both."  The Government Code reporter sections on
> legislative subpoenas cross references to C.C.P. 1985 et seq. ("subpoenas
> generally").  However, the "deposition subpoena" provisions (C.C.P. 2025
> et seq.) more closely resemble the "discovery" process that the Senator
> seems to be undertaking.
>
> Subpoenas against out-of-state residents under C.C.P. 1985 et seq.
>
> C.C.P. 1989 is entitled "Residency requirements for attendance of
> witnesses" and provides that "A witness, including a witness specified in
> subdivision (b) of Section 1987, is not obliged to attend as a witness
> before any court, judge, justice or any other officer, unless the witness
> is a resident within the state at the time of service."
>
> There is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by
> Section 1989.  Section 1987.3 provides "[w]hen a subpoena duchess mecum is
> served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided
> in Article 4 (commencing with Section 1560) of Chapter 2 of Division 11 of
> the Evidence Code, and his personal attendance is not required by the
> terms of the subpoena, Section 1989 shall not apply."  (Evade. Code 1650
> lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records
> where the business is "neither a party nor the place where any cause of
> action is alleged to have arisen.")
>
> On commentator noted the following with respect to C.C.P. 1987.3:
>
> "The rule limiting subpoenas to California "residents" (C.C.P. 1989) does
> not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records
> unless their personal attendance is required. See C.C.P. 1987.3; Amoco
> Chem. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London (1995) 34
> Cal.App.4th 554, 561 fn. 9.  Thus, a nonresident custodian of business
> records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon
> him or her while present in California, by producing the records in
> accordance with Cal. Evid. Code 1560 (delivering copies of the records and
> accompanying affidavit to the court clerk)... [However], C.C.P. 1987.3
> probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a
> business entity subject to California jurisdiction. Otherwise, there would
> be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a
> nonresident.  See Amoco Chem. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of
> London, supra."

> Moreover, in one unpublished case, Allee v. King (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
> 1081, the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident
> defendant to produce original out-of-state documents at trial.  In so
> holding, the court stated that:
>
> "even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial, his presence
> does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the
> out-of-state documents.   Although section 1989 uses the word "witness"
> and does not refer to documents, it has long been presumed under common
> law that documents in other states are outside the court's territorial
> jurisdiction, so that a court will allow the use of copies or other
> secondary evidence instead of originals.  (See, e.g., Heinz v. Heinz
> (1946) 73 Cal.App.2d 61, 66, 165 P.2d 967, and cases cited therein.)   The
> recognition that out-of-state documents are not subject to the court's
> process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that,
> absent a statute properly conferring broader powers, the extent of a
> state's subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is
> coterminous with its borders.  (See 97 C.J.S., Witnesses, S 17, p. 367, S
> 23, p. 375, S 25, p. 380;  81 Am.Jur.2d, Witnesses, S 8, p. 32, S 14, p.
> 39.)
>
> However, the Allee court notes that the "state-border" limitation on
> subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national
> corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are
> out-of-state.  Therefore, even under Allee, if a subpoena was issued to a
> California Enron entity that possessed responsive documents, that Enron
> entity may be obligated to respond.  See Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co.
> (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806.
>
> Therefore, if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an
> out-of-state officer of Enron, Enron has a very good argument that that
> witness is not obligated to attend under C.C.P. 1989.  It also seems
> probable that, under Amoco and Allele cited above, if a subpoena is served
> on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a non-California Enron
> entity, the subpoena may be invalid.  However, if a subpoena seeking the
> production of documents is served on the custodian of records (or someone
> similarly situated) who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses
> responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in
> California, that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the
> documents.  It is an open question whether that custodian of records
> (employed by an Enron entity in California) would only be required to
> produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California
> entity or whether that person's obligation would extend further -- to
> produce out-of state documents (i.e. documents from non-California Enron

> Additional threshold question:  If the legislative subpoena was treated as
> a "deposition subpoena," would a court deciding the enforceability of a
> legislative subpoena treat Enron as a "party" or as a "non-party"?
>
> The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously
> different for the two.  The deposition of a party or party-affiliated
> witness may be noticed (without a subpoena) for a place within 75 miles of
> the witness' residence.  It is unclear how a court would resolve this

> seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enron's
> obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its
> obligations if it was served with a "non-party" subpoena.
>
> There are three types of "deposition subpoena":  a "testimony only
> subpoena" (requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness), a
> "business records subpoena" (requires only the production of business
> records) and a "records and testimony subpoena" (requires both -- also
> formerly called subpoena duces tecum).  The second of these is the most
> relevant to Enron.
>
> The attendance of an non party out-of-state witness or the production of
> documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the
> deposition is to be taken.  C.C.P. 2026 (b)(2).  Specifically, C.C.P.
> 2026(b)(2) provides "If the deponent is not a party to the action or an
> officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, a party serving
> a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and
> procedures required and available under the laws of the state, territory,
> or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the
> deponent to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document or
> tangible thing for inspection, copying, and any related activity."
>
> Some states issue subpoenas routinely, some require a showing of
> materiality or relevancy, and some require a commission from the court
> where the action is pending.    This question will depend on the law of
> the state when the custodian of records resides.
>
> Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on
> an in-state custodian of records would compel the production of
> out-of-state documents.  Weil & Brown, Rutter Group, California Practice
> Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial at 5:540.4 notes:
>
> "It is unclear whether service of a "business records" subpoena on a
> nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records
> located outside the state. ... C.C.P. 2020(d) requires that the subpoena
> be directed to the records "custodian" (or someone authorized to certify
> the records). Whether "custodian" requires actual custody of the records
> is unclear. If it does, serving an officer or agent in California would
> not compel production of business records located elsewhere.... The result
> is different where a "records and testimony" subpoena is used. That
> procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party, not
> merely in his or her custody."

> If the State of California files civil suit against Enron to obtain

>
> If the action filed by the State of California presents a federal
> question, then under the rationale of the court in People of the State of

> The Court then found:

The State Enron Records to Stay Secret Court: A judge orders confidentiality for the power firm's documents. A Senate panel probing electricity price gouging has subpoenaed them.

SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp., the giant Texas-based seller of electric power, won a court ruling Thursday in its quest to guarantee the secrecy of hundreds of thousands of internal business documents sought by state lawmakers. 
A Senate committee investigating price gouging in California's wholesale electricity market subpoenaed Enron's documents in April, seeking records of electricity sales, bidding strategies, prices and out-of-state transactions.
The company refused to make the documents available without a court order protecting the confidentiality of the records. Enron sued July 11, and on Thursday Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Charles C. Kobayashi granted the company's request for a protective order. 
The judge noted in his order that Enron is a business competitor of the California Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of the state's two largest utilities last January. 
"Although the committee argues that the Senate is not in competition with plaintiff," wrote Kobayashi, "the functions of the Senate and the Department of Water Resources are intertwined in so many ways that there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict, actual conflicts can arise." 
Kobayashi's order is a reversal of an earlier, tentative ruling, in which he concluded that imposing a protective order for Enron would be an "unacceptable" intrusion by the courts into the internal operations of the Legislature. 
Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based company, described executives as "very pleased" with the court ruling. "Turning over the documents was never the issue," she said, "The issue was always protecting our rights." 
Enron officials will work with committee Chairman Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) to craft an agreement that details which documents will be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides, Denne said. 
Reliant Energy of Houston, another company that resisted demands for business records, on Wednesday signed a confidentiality agreement with Dunn's committee and will begin bringing 250,000 documents to a depository in Sacramento, said Reliant spokesman Marty Wilson. 
Dunn said other companies have begun to deliver documents to Sacramento, but not all are fully complying with subpoenas. 
"There are some major holes that have to be plugged by the market participants," he said. 
On July 21, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market voted to recommend that Enron be cited for contempt for not turning over its documents. 
The full Senate has yet to vote on that recommendation. 
The committee, which the Senate created in March, has focused its investigation on the private companies that purchased power plants after California moved to deregulate its electricity market in 1996.

California judge says no to Enron subpoena
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Enron Corp. received a protective order Thursday for documents subpoenaed by a California state Senate committee. 
Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi ruled that Houston-based Enron can prevent the legislative panel from sharing information in the thousands of documents relating to energy trading in California. 
"Once the confidential information is disclosed, no amount of sanctions will be able to rectify the damage that might be caused," Kobayashi wrote in his order. 
The Senate committee requested documents including e-mails, phone logs, financial records and records of any Enron "trading strategies." The panel is probing whether generators manipulated the power market. 

Enron Wins Document Protection Order From Calif Judge

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Sacramento Superior Court judge Thursday ruled that Enron Corp (ENE) must comply with a legislative subpoena of financial documents, but reversed an earlier decision and granted the company a protective order of the documents, according to a copy of the ruling seen by Dow Jones Newswires.
Enron said the ruling was a victory, as the company has always maintained it would be happy to comply with the subpoena by the state Senate committee as long as the company received a protective order. 
"We are obviously very happy with the ruling and look forward to working with the committee to come up with a protective order that truly protects our proprietary information," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The Senate Select Committee To Investigate Market Manipulation has already cited Enron and Reliant Energy, Inc (REI) with contempt for refusing to provide documents, a charge for which the companies could be fined. 
Once Enron and the committee draft a protective order and the judge agrees to it, the company will hand over any documents that the committee wants, Palmer said. 
However, an attorney for the committee expressed skepticism that the company would actually follow through. 
"We have no indication from Enron that they would agree to produce the documents we've requested, even with the confidentiality order," said Larry Drivon, special counsel to the committee. 
He added that he could not speculate if the committee would drop its contempt charge if Enron did produce all requested documents. 
In his decision granting the protective order, Judge Charles Kobayashi wrote that he was not convinced the committee has solid standards in place to ensure Enron's protection. 
"It is clear that there are no standards for determining what are the available protections, no procedure for determining what is a legitimately confidential, privileged, proprietary matter, no procedure for oversight and no prescribed remedy for (Enron) for any unauthorized disclosures," Kobayashi wrote. 
Last week, a San Francisco Superior Court judge granted Enron a protective order in a separate investigation by the state attorney general.

USA: Enron must give documents to Calif. lawmakers-judge.

09/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee probing charges of price gouging during the state's energy crisis, a California judge ruled on Thursday. 
But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi also ruled lawmakers must provide Enron with a confidentiality agreement, saying he was not convinced the committee would respect the firm's right to maintain proprietary secrets.
"If the committee could take the requested action in the name of the public interest, then the committee ostensibly could require newspapers to surrender their confidentiality rights, attorneys to surrender their attorney-client privilege, (and) psychiatrists to surrender their privileges," the judge wrote. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has subpoenaed documents from a number of energy firms to probe accusations California power agencies and utilities were overcharged some $8.9 billion for wholesale electricity during the state's energy crisis which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold. 
Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the state's poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the growing needs of its 34 million residents and its industries. 
An Enron spokeswoman said on Thursday the firm has already turned over tens of thousands of documents, but wanted assurances that certain sensitive documents containing proprietary trade secrets, for example, would be protected under a confidentiality agreement. 
The firm will now work with the committee to hammer out the specifics of such an agreement, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. 
"We are pleased with the judge's order in that he agreed that our constitutional right would be protected," Denne said. "The issue has always been protecting the confidential documents." 
The committee has already asked the full Senate to cite Enron as well as Reliant Energy Inc. for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents. It would be the first such citation imposed by the state Senate since 1929, but has not yet come up for a vote. 
Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. however, avoided the contempt threat by agreeing with legislators' demands to sign confidentiality agreements, open a document depository close to Sacramento, and begin placing documents there relating to the company's recent business in California. 
Sacramento judge says committee must protect Enron documents

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation of wholesale energy prices, a judge ruled Thursday, but the state must give the energy company a confidentiality agreement. 
Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi said in his ruling that he wasn't convinced that the Senate committee "will be able to maintain the petitioner's right to confidentiality."
The Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market subpoenaed documents from six energy companies as they investigated last year's price spikes in the wholesale electricity market. 
If the committee went forward without a confidentiality agreement, Kobayashi said, it could then require the same of newspapers, attorneys or psychiatrists. 
Enron's motion to quash the subpoenas were dismissed last week and the judge reaffirmed that ruling Thursday. Another Enron motion seeking an injunction against the committee will be heard Wednesday. 
Company spokeswoman Karen Denne called the protective order ruling a victory. "This gives us the confidentiality agreement we've been seeking." 
The order's specifics will be worked out with Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee chairman. It will then be signed by a judge, once both sides agree. 
Enron officials have offered to turn over 25,000 documents that were already in California, but refused to comply with the rest of the subpoena. 
The committee found Enron in contempt for not turning over all the requested documents. A full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the full Senate, which has not voted on it. A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. 
A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.

Rich,
	Thank you for the update.  I would like to speak to you today about
some other practical suggestions that we have relating to email handling.  I
also want to tell you about a situation that came up in the past few days.
In short, one employee's computer hard drive ran out of space related to the
do not delete directive.  We decided to have the employee move sufficient
files from the hard drive on to the network (so they would be backed up on
tape) and then authorized the employee to delete those files that had been
moved to create sufficient work space so that they could do their job.  We
anticipate that this issue may arise again and we intend to follow the same
procedure.

	I will call you to discuss these issues.

Thanks
Gary

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the
preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your

Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will
allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any

personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY
FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Here is the letter I was referring to yesterday sent by Reliant's Sacramento
counsel to Senator Dunn.  In paragraph no. 1, Charles Stevens refers to how
small Reliant's market share is in the WSCC power market.  He suggests that
the Committee obtain the entire database, which reflects all bidders in the
market.  He goes on to say that the information from obtaining all of the
data would give a far more accurate picture than could be obtained by
looking at the data of a few "generators".

This letter plus some comments that Larry Drivon made to Michael Molland
gave rise to the inference that Reliant's counsel, Charles Stevens, may have
been suggesting in his discussions with Senator Dunn's staff that Enron
should be included in the process.  It may be that the inference will turn
out not to be accurate.  That is all the information we have on the subject.


Thanks.

> Mike,
>
>  Here is the draft research memo that Amanda prepared on some of the
> questions surrounding Senator Dunn's investigation (some of this you saw
> before):
>
> Legislative Committee Subpoena Power
>
> Government Code Section 9401, provides that "a subpoena requiring the
> attendance of any witness before the Senate, Assembly, or a committee may
> be issued by the President of the Senate, Speaker of the Assembly, or the
> chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is
> desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the
> respective house."
>
> There is a relative dearth of case law interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et
> seq. and the Govt. Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil
> Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas (C.C.P. 1985, et seq.).
> Therefore, it is possible that the provisions of both the Govt. Code and
> the C.C.P. will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena
> issued by a legislative committee.
>
> Govt. Code Section 9402 provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it "(a)
> states whether the proceeding is before the Senate, Assembly or a
> committee. (b) is addressed to the witness [presumably the custodian of
> records when documents are sought]. (c) requires the attendance of the
> witness at a time and place certain and (d) is signed by the President of
> the Senate, Speaker of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before
> whom attendance of the witness is desired."
>
> If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or "neglects or
> refuses ... to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper
> books, papers or document sin his possession or under his control, he has
> committed a contempt."  Govt. Code Section 9405.   If the contempt is
> committed while the Legislature is in session, Govt. Code Section 9407
> provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or
> Assembly "for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or
> Assembly."  If the Legislature is not in session, "the superior court in
> and for the county in which any inquiry, investigation hearing or
> proceeding [is] held ... may compel the ... production of books, papers,
> documents and accounts, as required by the subpoena issued by the
> committee, on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court
> asking that the witness be so compelled."
>
> Govt. Code Section 9409 provides that "any witness neglecting or refusing
> to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested...."  It is unclear how
> this provision would (or whether it could) be applied to a subpoena issued
> to the custodian of records of a non-resident company.
>
> Motion to Quash Subpoena
>
> California courts have held, under C.C.P. Section 1985, that a motion to
> quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a
> subpoena duces tecum.  See e.g. People ex rel. Dept. of Public Works v.
> Younger (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 575.  My research has revealed no case in
> which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by
> a motion to quash, but, as noted above, there appear to be only a very few
> cases interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et seq.   Therefore, it appears that a
> superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by
> a legislative committee (assuming that we want to take the risk of state
> court jurisdiction).
>
> In one early case, the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and
> accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate
> Committee were fatally defective.  Ex Parte McLain (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d
> 274.  In McLain, the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served
> upon Mr. McLain, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a
> subpoena calling for the production of various books, papers and
> documents.  Mr. McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer
> questions or produce the documents.  Upon representation of the Committee,
> the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr. McLain to produce the
> documents.  Mr. McLain again appeared before the Committee and again
> refused to produce the documents at which point, an affidavit was filed in
> Superior Court stating:
>
> "That, based upon evidence in its possession, the said Senate Interim
> Committee has determined that each of the books, papers, and documents
> specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now
> under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee, and the
> production of such books, papers and documents is necessary in order to
> enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties
> imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California
> pursuant to said Senate Resolution No. 162." and "That each of the books,
> papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to
> the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee
> and that the production of such books, papers and documents is necessary
> in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the
> duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of
> California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No. 162."
>
> The Superior Court found Mr. McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him
> committed to the sheriff until he produced the records.  The Court of
> Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because "a
> witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty
> of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and
> pertinency of the books and papers called for.  In cases of constructive
> contempt, as is this, not only the order but also the affidavit upon which
> it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the
> offense."  McLain at 276.
>
> This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting
> C.C.P. 1985, which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege
> material facts rather than conclusory statements.  See e.g. Grannis v.
> Board of Medical Examiners (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 551.
>
> However, cases interpreting C.C.P. 1985 also require the subpoena to
> demonstrate a level of specificity, materiality and relevance to be held
> proper.  See e.g. Pacific Auto Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 273
> Cal.App.2d 61.  It is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative
> committees are held to this same standard.
>
> What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued
> against the Enron' custodian of records, an out-of-state resident,
> intended to affect the production of out-of-state Enron documents?
>
>
> Here are the threshold questions:
>
> A.  Since we have found so few cases interpreting Govt. Code Section 9401,
> to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the
> same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending
> civil state court action?
>
> B.  Would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee
> subpoena make reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections governing
> subpoenas "generally" (i.e. C.C.P. 1985 et seq.) or those governing
> "deposition subpoenas" (i.e. C.C.P. 2020 et seq.)?  This is a toss-up and
> the answer may well be "both."  The Government Code reporter sections on
> legislative subpoenas cross references to C.C.P. 1985 et seq. ("subpoenas
> generally").  However, the "deposition subpoena" provisions (C.C.P. 2025
> et seq.) more closely resemble the "discovery" process that the Senator
> seems to be undertaking.
>
> Subpoenas against out-of-state residents under C.C.P. 1985 et seq.
>
> C.C.P. 1989 is entitled "Residency requirements for attendance of
> witnesses" and provides that "A witness, including a witness specified in
> subdivision (b) of Section 1987, is not obliged to attend as a witness
> before any court, judge, justice or any other officer, unless the witness
> is a resident within the state at the time of service."
>
> There is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by
> Section 1989.  Section 1987.3 provides "[w]hen a subpoena duchess mecum is
> served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided
> in Article 4 (commencing with Section 1560) of Chapter 2 of Division 11 of
> the Evidence Code, and his personal attendance is not required by the
> terms of the subpoena, Section 1989 shall not apply."  (Evade. Code 1650
> lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records
> where the business is "neither a party nor the place where any cause of
> action is alleged to have arisen.")
>
> On commentator noted the following with respect to C.C.P. 1987.3:
>
> "The rule limiting subpoenas to California "residents" (C.C.P. 1989) does
> not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records
> unless their personal attendance is required. See C.C.P. 1987.3; Amoco
> Chem. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London (1995) 34
> Cal.App.4th 554, 561 fn. 9.  Thus, a nonresident custodian of business
> records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon
> him or her while present in California, by producing the records in
> accordance with Cal. Evid. Code 1560 (delivering copies of the records and
> accompanying affidavit to the court clerk)... [However], C.C.P. 1987.3
> probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a
> business entity subject to California jurisdiction. Otherwise, there would
> be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a
> nonresident.  See Amoco Chem. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of
> London, supra."
>
> Werner, Fairbanks & Epstein, Rutter Group, California Practice Guide:
> Civil Procedure & Trials at 1.57-58
>
> Moreover, in one unpublished case, Allee v. King (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
> 1081, the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident
> defendant to produce original out-of-state documents at trial.  In so
> holding, the court stated that:
>
> "even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial, his presence
> does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the
> out-of-state documents.   Although section 1989 uses the word "witness"
> and does not refer to documents, it has long been presumed under common
> law that documents in other states are outside the court's territorial
> jurisdiction, so that a court will allow the use of copies or other
> secondary evidence instead of originals.  (See, e.g., Heinz v. Heinz
> (1946) 73 Cal.App.2d 61, 66, 165 P.2d 967, and cases cited therein.)   The
> recognition that out-of-state documents are not subject to the court's
> process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that,
> absent a statute properly conferring broader powers, the extent of a
> state's subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is
> coterminous with its borders.  (See 97 C.J.S., Witnesses, S 17, p. 367, S
> 23, p. 375, S 25, p. 380;  81 Am.Jur.2d, Witnesses, S 8, p. 32, S 14, p.
> 39.)
>
> However, the Allee court notes that the "state-border" limitation on
> subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national
> corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are
> out-of-state.  Therefore, even under Allee, if a subpoena was issued to a
> California Enron entity that possessed responsive documents, that Enron
> entity may be obligated to respond.  See Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co.
> (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806.
>
> Therefore, if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an
> out-of-state officer of Enron, Enron has a very good argument that that
> witness is not obligated to attend under C.C.P. 1989.  It also seems
> probable that, under Amoco and Allele cited above, if a subpoena is served
> on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a non-California Enron
> entity, the subpoena may be invalid.  However, if a subpoena seeking the
> production of documents is served on the custodian of records (or someone
> similarly situated) who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses
> responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in
> California, that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the
> documents.  It is an open question whether that custodian of records
> (employed by an Enron entity in California) would only be required to
> produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California
> entity or whether that person's obligation would extend further -- to
> produce out-of state documents (i.e. documents from non-California Enron
> entities)  (This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the
> C.C.P. 2020 statutory scheme, see below, but is still open)

> Subpoenas against out-of-state residents under C.C.P. 2020 et seq.
>
> Additional threshold question:  If the legislative subpoena was treated as
> a "deposition subpoena," would a court deciding the enforceability of a
> legislative subpoena treat Enron as a "party" or as a "non-party"?
>
> The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously
> different for the two.  The deposition of a party or party-affiliated
> witness may be noticed (without a subpoena) for a place within 75 miles of
> the witness' residence.  It is unclear how a court would resolve this
> issue.  After all, if a court was resolving the issue at all, an Enron
> entity will have appeared before it. and would be a "party."  However, it
> seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enron's
> obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its
> obligations if it was served with a "non-party" subpoena.
>
> There are three types of "deposition subpoena":  a "testimony only
> subpoena" (requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness), a
> "business records subpoena" (requires only the production of business
> records) and a "records and testimony subpoena" (requires both -- also
> formerly called subpoena duces tecum).  The second of these is the most
> relevant to Enron.
>
> The attendance of an non party out-of-state witness or the production of
> documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the
> deposition is to be taken.  C.C.P. 2026 (b)(2).  Specifically, C.C.P.
> 2026(b)(2) provides "If the deponent is not a party to the action or an
> officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, a party serving
> a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and
> procedures required and available under the laws of the state, territory,
> or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the
> deponent to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document or
> tangible thing for inspection, copying, and any related activity."
>
> Some states issue subpoenas routinely, some require a showing of
> materiality or relevancy, and some require a commission from the court
> where the action is pending.    This question will depend on the law of
> the state when the custodian of records resides.
>
> Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on
> an in-state custodian of records would compel the production of
> out-of-state documents.  Weil & Brown, Rutter Group, California Practice
> Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial at 5:540.4 notes:
>
> "It is unclear whether service of a "business records" subpoena on a
> nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records
> located outside the state. ... C.C.P. 2020(d) requires that the subpoena
> be directed to the records "custodian" (or someone authorized to certify
> the records). Whether "custodian" requires actual custody of the records
> is unclear. If it does, serving an officer or agent in California would
> not compel production of business records located elsewhere.... The result
> is different where a "records and testimony" subpoena is used. That
> procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party, not
> merely in his or her custody."
>
> If the State of California files civil suit against Enron to obtain
> discovery of the requested documents, does the fact that the State is the
> plaintiff (rather than a private party) affect Enron's prospects for
> removal of the suit to federal court?
>
>
> If the action filed by the State of California presents a federal
> question, then under the rationale of the court in People of the State of
> California v. Steelcase Inc. (C.D. Cal. 1992) 792 F.Supp. 84, the case
> should be removable to federal court.
>
> In People of the State of California v. Steelcase Inc. (C.D. Cal. 1992)
> 792 F.Supp. 84, the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles brought
> suit alleging violations of the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition
> Statutes (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code 16720 and 17200).  The District Court
> found that, although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute
> Cartwright Act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies
> located in the county, the unfair competition statutes expressly provide
> that suit be brought "in the name of the people of the State of
> California."  Id. at 85.  Therefore, for the purposes of the Unfair
> Competition Claims, the Court found that the State of California was the
> real party in interest.
>
> The Court then found:
>
> (1) that "for diversity purposes, a state is not a citizen of itself.
> Therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action."  Id.
> Specifically, the Court found that: "[e]ven assuming arguendo that
> defendant is correct that the County of Los Angeles is the real party in
> interest and the proper party in the Cartwright Act claim, diversity
> jurisdiction does not lie because, under long- established teaching, there

> defendant.   E.g. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 2 L.Ed.

> the State of California is not a citizen of any state. "  Id.
>
> (2) that "[i]ndependent of its failure to meet the complete diversity
> test, the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of

> federal court, it should apply equally to the case where the state is a
> plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed
> to federal court by the defendant." Id.  (internal citations removed).
>
> However, the Court noted that "where removal is predicated on federal

> 444 U.S. 1077, 100 S.Ct. 1026, 62 L.Ed.2d 760 (1980)"
>
> United States v. General Dynamics Corp. (9th Cir. 1987) 828 F.2d 1356,
> 1366.  The General Dynamics Court went on to say that "only where an issue
> unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary

>
> In another context, the Ninth Circuit held that the exhaustion of

> prerequisite to indictment under the Federal Election Campaign Act:
>
> "... neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act provides
> the kind of "clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will"

> history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority
> of the FERC to enforce the Act administratively and by civil proceedings,
> Congress intended to leave undisturbed the Justice Department's authority

>
> United States v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 701
> (1979) 638 F.2d 1161.  See also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Shipping

>
> Therefore, it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine

Bob: I missed you by phone this morning, and will call again when you return
this afternoon.We have stopped plans to copy the EES contracts with
customers for power, pending further discussions with you. Here are the
considerations that seem relevant:

	. Both the AG and Dunn subpoenas request these contracts and
supporting documents. They are probably the only significant amount of EES
documents in California that are responsive to the Dunn subpoena.
	. They are currently kept in several places in the San Ramon office,
Costa Mesa and Long Beach. If we plan to gather them for a production in or
around Sacramento soon we should consider making copies of the Southern
California contracts so they are available for review and production in
Northern California. The extent of the Southern California contract
documents is about four or five boxes. San Ramon probably has about ten. We
could more easily hold off on the copying in San Ramon since it is close
both to our offices and Sacramento.
	. It is unlikely we can shift copying costs for these documents to
Dunn's committee or the AG. We could produce them in a central location, but
I doubt we can force them to go to several locations in the state to review
documents that fall in this category.

Michael, before we go to the expense of copying the EES contracts, I want
to see if Mike Kirby can convince the Committee that those contracts have
no relevance to its investigation, which in fact they don't.   Also, why
should Enron bear the costs of this massive document production.  The
federal courts (at least in Houston) require the party seeking discovery to
pay the cost.  If we conclude that we have to pay for this, maybe we should
make the contracts available in a room for their review.  Please call me.
Thanks.

   Subject:  Status report on document identification at Enron Corp.
             offices i n San Francisco

      Amanda Smith, Peter Meringolo,  and I met with officers and
   administrators at the San Francisco offices of Enron Corp. this morning
   and
   identified documents responsive to  the Dunn committee subpoena. Amanda
   and
   Peter then collected and reviewed potentially responsive documents in
   the
   afternoon. They will continue to do so, with the assistance of two
   paralegals, tomorrow. Assuming we do not produce documents relating to
   the
   development and siting of generation facilities ( which comprise the
   lion's
   chair of the documents in San Francisco) we estimate there are about ten
   boxes of responsive hard copy documents in the office. However, we have
   not
   yet reviewed any electronic documents.  The following summarizes these
   discussions and the status of document identification:

       Most of the documents in the SF office correspond to one of the
   three major functions of the office.  The predominant operation is the
   development of power generation facilities in the Western United States
   under the supervision of Dave Parquet. Second, the office markets
   wholesale
   power to municipal utilities and other customers under the direction of
   Mike
   McDonald. Both these operations are done by Enron North American and
   both
   Parquay and McDonald are vice presidents of Enron North America.
   McDonald
   works closely with EPMI in Portland. The final significant function of
   the
   office consists of legislative and regulatory affairs, which is part of
   Enron Corp and managed by Sue Mara.

        We reviewed many of the documents within the custody of persons
   working under the management of Parquet and Mara. McDonald is on
   vacation
   until June 11 and has not returned phone calls to his home message
   machine.
   Given his close relationship to EPMI in Portland we need to reach him
   soon
   to interview him on the subject. He is said to have potentially
   sensitive
   pricing and financial information relating to wholesale power on his
   hard
   drive.  The following summarizes our review of the documents in the
   Parquet
   and Mara supervised operations.

      Mara:  Many documents may be privileged. Non-privileged documents do
   not appear especially sensitive- examples are reports of trade
   association
   meetings and PUC and other regulatory proceedings.

      Parquet: Parquet was on the board of ISO. He has about two boxes of
   responsive ISO information. Most appear non sensitive, but may require
   notice to ISO prior to production.. There is also some bid information
   regarding an Enron offer to buy a PG and E generating facility later
   purchased by Mirant. These documents are also non-sensitive. Parquet has
   financial documents, including the allocation of profit and loss to
   certain
   Enron subsidiaries.
      However, there are tens (50 to 100) of boxes of documents relating
   to power plants Enron has or is  planning to develop in the Western
   United
   States. Generally, these type of documents do not appear called for in
   the
   subpoena. However, embedded within these development plans are documents
   that are responsive to other categories of the subpoena and sensitive-
   such
   as pricing curves, information about future contracts, and forecasts of
   supply and demand for power.  Parquay says these are competitively
   sensitive
   documents. It would take several days to review these documents.
   Further,
   many contain third party information subject to  confidentiality
   agreements
   with such third parties. If we produce them we would need to notify
   these
   third parties soon. I suggest we not produce these documents but do so
   openly by disclosing to Drivon that we are treating documents relating
   to
   siting of power plants not operated by Enron as non-responsive.

      McDonald: This operating unit has few hard copy documents. Most
   sensitive information is said to be on McDonald's hard drive, including
   financial information that reportedly shows how much money Enron made in
   California in the past year or two by selling wholesale power. Someone
   needs
   to reach McDonald so we can ask him about it.

      Document retention: The office manager says that a backup tape is
   made of the server and the "H" drives on each computer every day. 20
   days of
   backup tapes are kept before they are overwritten. The backup tape from
   every fourth Friday of each month is kept permanently. They believe
   e-mail
   is so preserved on this back up tapes, but say that only people in "
   Houston" know for sure. We should find out. We asked the office manager
   to
   retain copies of all backup tapes going forward.

      EES: The EES personnel in San Francisco have few responsive
   documents. The Dunn subpoena asks for all of Enron's contracts for
   retail
   sale of power, which are also requested by the AG from EES. These
   probably
   total 20 or so boxes. We will ask the EES offices in San Ramon and Costa
   Mesa offices, which house these contracts, to copy them and send them to
   us
   for our review. We will hold them until we make a decision whether to
   produce them, either to the AG or Dunn.

      PUC production: Enron previously produced about a half box of
   documents to the PUC. Most are responsive and should be also produced to
   Dunn.

      I expect we will have completed at least a cursory review of the
   responsive hard copy documents in San Francisco that do not pertain to
   plant
   construction and operation by tomorrow afternoon. We then need to review
   the
   documents on the hard drives of Parquay and McDonald, hopefully by
   Thursday
   afternoon. We will collect examples of  the most sensitive documents we
   find
   tomorrow and send them Tuesday evening to Bob Williams for review .

One of my partners, David Schrader, was opposite Joe Dunn for four years in
litigation in Southern California.  He tells me that Joe's strength is his
presentation -- low key, sincere, effective in deposition, good with Judges.
However, he is not rated as being all that smart.  He still maintains an
office with Mark Robinson, a prominent heavy hitter plaintiffs' lawyer in
Southern California.  During this litigation, he was the coordinating
counsel for the plaintiffs in the breast implant litigation.  Thus, he is
very well connected to the plaintiffs bar and they probably funded part of
his campaign.  David believes that Dunn aspires to higher offices.

One other partner, Greg Williams, reports that he knows Joe Dunn very well.
I will report as soon as I have spoken with  him.

Thanks
Gary

As I reported to you from Irvine on Friday, I attended the hearing conducted 
by Senator Dunn in Irvine, California. It was sound bite city, with no good 
press for any generator or marketer.  At the outset of the hearing Sen Dunn 
stated that his committee had been in lengthy discussions regarding 
confidentiality issues with the generators, without success, and that they 
would be sending out subpoenas for records starting on Monday(today) and that 
the production of documents from Cal ISO was to start last Friday.  Sen Dunn 
spent much of the day making his public record , posturing about the 
difficulty of getting any documents from any generator or marketer because of 
claims of confidentiality, and how unresponsive FERC has been. He got the 
FERC lawyer, Robert Pease, to testify that any confidentiality afforded to 
the bid data at Cal ISO under the FERC tariff would end after 6 months. As 
you undoubtedly read, the PUC chairwoman had nothing good to say about the 
generators. Since the subpoenas will probably be forthcoming shortly, do we 
want to have a conference call of the group to discuss what transpired at 
Friday's hearing ? I am interested in knowing  how everyone intends to 
proceed in response to any subpoenas from the Committee,particularly after 
the failed efforts with the protective order. Please call me if we have not 
talked by phone when you get this.

 	Here is a draft of a proposed protective order for your review. We
told the AG on Friday that we would send them a draft of our proposed
protective order tomorrow, September 5.  We also agreed with the AG on
Friday that we would each submit our proposed orders to the court on
September 7.
	The attached draft is a redlined version of the protective order
proposed to us by the AG on August 29. We have tried to keep changes to a
minimum, but have drastically reduced the number of "authorized persons"
under the order, and included provisions to categorize documents as "highly
confidential" and seek further court review to protect this category of
documents.

Here is follow-up research on the question of whether we could remove a
criminal case against Enron to federal court.  It is not as promising as we
first thought.

	Amanda Smith, Peter Meringolo,  and I met with officers and
administrators at the San Francisco offices of Enron Corp. this morning and
identified documents responsive to  the Dunn committee subpoena. Amanda and
Peter then collected and reviewed potentially responsive documents in the
afternoon. They will continue to do so, with the assistance of two
paralegals, tomorrow. Assuming we do not produce documents relating to the
development and siting of generation facilities ( which comprise the lion's
chair of the documents in San Francisco) we estimate there are about ten
boxes of responsive hard copy documents in the office. However, we have not
yet reviewed any electronic documents.  The following summarizes these
discussions and the status of document identification:

	 Most of the documents in the SF office correspond to one of the
three major functions of the office.  The predominant operation is the
development of power generation facilities in the Western United States
under the supervision of Dave Parquet. Second, the office markets wholesale
power to municipal utilities and other customers under the direction of Mike
McDonald. Both these operations are done by Enron North American and  both
Parquay and McDonald are vice presidents of Enron North America. McDonald
works closely with EPMI in Portland. The final significant function of the
office consists of legislative and regulatory affairs, which is part of
Enron Corp and managed by Sue Mara.

	  We reviewed many of the documents within the custody of persons
working under the management of Parquet and Mara. McDonald is on vacation
until June 11 and has not returned phone calls to his home message machine.
Given his close relationship to EPMI in Portland we need to reach him soon
to interview him on the subject. He is said to have potentially sensitive
pricing and financial information relating to wholesale power on his hard
drive.  The following summarizes our review of the documents in the Parquet
and Mara supervised operations.

	Mara:  Many documents may be privileged. Non-privileged documents do
not appear especially sensitive- examples are reports of trade association
meetings and PUC and other regulatory proceedings.

	Parquet: Parquet was on the board of ISO. He has about two boxes of
responsive ISO information. Most appear non sensitive, but may require
notice to ISO prior to production.. There is also some bid information
regarding an Enron offer to buy a PG and E generating facility later
purchased by Mirant. These documents are also non-sensitive. Parquet has
financial documents, including the allocation of profit and loss to certain
Enron subsidiaries.
	However, there are tens (50 to 100) of boxes of documents relating
to power plants Enron has or is  planning to develop in the Western United
States. Generally, these type of documents do not appear called for in the
subpoena. However, embedded within these development plans are documents
that are responsive to other categories of the subpoena and sensitive- such
as pricing curves, information about future contracts, and forecasts of
supply and demand for power.  Parquay says these are competitively sensitive
documents. It would take several days to review these documents.  Further,
many contain third party information subject to  confidentiality agreements
with such third parties. If we produce them we would need to notify these
third parties soon. I suggest we not produce these documents but do so
openly by disclosing to Drivon that we are treating documents relating to
siting of power plants not operated by Enron as non-responsive.

	McDonald: This operating unit has few hard copy documents. Most
sensitive information is said to be on McDonald's hard drive, including
financial information that reportedly shows how much money Enron made in
California in the past year or two by selling wholesale power. Someone needs
to reach McDonald so we can ask him about it.

	Document retention: The office manager says that a backup tape is
made of the server and the "H" drives on each computer every day. 20 days of
backup tapes are kept before they are overwritten. The backup tape from
every fourth Friday of each month is kept permanently. They believe e-mail
is so preserved on this back up tapes, but say that only people in "
Houston" know for sure. We should find out. We asked the office manager to
retain copies of all backup tapes going forward.

	EES: The EES personnel in San Francisco have few responsive
documents. The Dunn subpoena asks for all of Enron's contracts for retail
sale of power, which are also requested by the AG from EES. These  probably
total 20 or so boxes. We will ask the EES offices in San Ramon and Costa
Mesa offices, which house these contracts, to copy them and send them to us
for our review. We will hold them until we make a decision whether to
produce them, either to the AG or Dunn.

	PUC production: Enron previously produced about a half box of
documents to the PUC. Most are responsive and should be also produced to
Dunn.

	I expect we will have completed at least a cursory review of the
responsive hard copy documents in San Francisco that do not pertain to plant
construction and operation by tomorrow afternoon. We then need to review the
documents on the hard drives of Parquay and McDonald, hopefully by Thursday
afternoon. We will collect examples of  the most sensitive documents we find
tomorrow and send them Tuesday evening to Bob Williams for review .

This reports on our meet and confer session with the AG's office today
regarding the subpoenas served upon Enron Energy Services. Mike Kirby and I
spoke with Deputy AGs Margaret Wrighter and Paul Stein for approximately two
hours.  These are the essential points we covered:
*	Non-waiver of objections:  They agreed that EES did not waive any
objections by attempting to negotiate compliance with the subpoena.  They
will agree that any interim production of  documents would not waive any of
EES's objections to the subpoena, except as to those documents actually
produced.
*	Territoriality:  We told them that EES would not produce documents
that resided outside the state.  Much of the conference was devoted to their
disagreement with this position.  Wrighter suggested that the AG may seek
prompt court relief on this issue or, in the alternative, file a lawsuit to
make EES a party in this litigation, then reach out of state documents
through ordinary discovery.  We are at an impasse on this issue.
*	Confidentiality:  The AG proposes a confidentiality order identical
to the order in place between Reliant and Dynegy in their litigation with
the AG in Los Angeles.  This order limits access to confidential documents
to less than 20 persons, but provides that persons outside the AG's office
at the PUC and other California governmental agencies may review produced
documents. The court in LA  has recently ruled that the confidentiality in
place with Reliant and Dynegy and Mirant may be amended to permit the
offices of the Attorneys General of Oregon and Washington to review produced
documents, subject to the confidentiality provisions of the agreement.
Reliant and Dynergy are challenging this provision of the order in the
appellate courts, but have not obtained an order staying their production
under this order.  The AG says they will not sign a different
confidentiality order with us.  We did not agree to these provisions.  We
are to give the AG a redlined confidentiality order on Monday that we would
accept in return for producing documents within California.
*	Production of electronic documents:  They insist that all documents
kept in electronic form be produced in  electronic form.  We discussed the
difficulties and burdens of doing this.  They say they will insist upon this
requirement.  We will consider compliance for electronic documents within
the state if it is not burdensome to do so.
*	Confidentiality of customer contracts:  They will agree to narrow
production to commercial customers. We explained that our commercial
contracts have confidentiality provisions with our customers.  We told them
most have approximately a ten day notice period which we will honor.  They
asked for an example of this provision, which I said we would provide. They
took the position that we should have been given notice to our customers
weeks ago and demanded production.  We told them we would not do so until,
at the earliest, July 30, after we had given appropriate notice.  They asked
that we begin to produce some documents before then.
*	Interim production: We told them that, subject to an acceptable
confidentiality order, we were prepared to produce documents which were
reasonably requested by their subpoena that reside within California
beginning July 30,  on the condition that it would not operate as a waiver
of any of our objections in later litigation. They said they would think
about this offer and call us back.  Wrighter called back this afternoon,
saying that they wish us to continue with the plans to make an interim
production. She did not promise not to file a lawsuit in the interim.
	Accordingly, we intend to prepare an acceptable confidentiality
agreement sufficient to protect the  production of EES's California
documents, then send it to the AG with a letter that set forth the terms of
any interim production under that agreement. If they do not agree to the
confidentiality agreement, or the terms of the interim production, we will
not produce any documents. We will send this letter to the AG early next
week after we have distributed a copy for your review.

 	Bob Williams, Andrew Edison, Michael Molland, Amanda Smith, and two
IT professionals working with EES, Jon Eastlund and Pete van de Gohn, today
discussed a going forward document retention policy for EES as a result of
the California AG's subpoena. This is a summary of our discussion.
*	Agreement with AG with respect to EPMI-Portland: I (per my
conversation with Gary Fergus) confirmed that the document retention policy
that was negotiated in December, 2000 with the AG with respect to EPMI in
Portland is as follows:  All employees are instructed not to delete any
e-mail for 24 hours.  Each 24 hours a backup "snapshot" of the entire e-mail
server in Portland is taken.  After 24 hours, employees may delete e-mail.
This policy has been in place since mid-December and back-up tapes should
exist for e-mail for each day from mid-December through the present.
*	Description of E-mail server organization within EES:   All EES
employees are on one of two e-mail systems: (1) the exchange server/Legacy
system or (2) Lotus Notes.  The exchange/Legacy system is run off of three
servers located in San Ramon, California,  Costa Mesa, California,  and
Phoenix, Arizona.  The Lotus Notes server is in Houston.  The majority of
EES personnel in California probably are on the exchange/Legacy server, but
there is no way of knowing who is which server without individually
checking.   EES personnel who were originally hired in California probably
use the Legacy  system. Generally,  the only in-California personnel who use
the Lotus Notes system are those who were originally hired by EES to work
outside of California. Virtually all EES employees outside California use
the Lotus Notes system.
*	Current e-mail retention of Legacy system: The customary practice is
to keep daily back up tapes, which are over written weekly, as well as one
weekly snapshot of the system, which is overwritten after 30 days. As of
last week, the exchange/Legacy server is being preserved as follows:  the
daily and weekly tapes are no longer being overwritten and are being
preserved by Jon Eastlund.  (Jon is checking with his subordinate in Costa
Mesa to confirm that this is also being done in Costa Mesa).  Jon reports
that the earliest weekly back up tape which is still preserved dates from
May 25th. He is keeping that tape in San Ramon until it can be picked up by
Brobeck.
*	Retention of e-mail of Lotus Notes System: The Lotus Notes server is
backed up every day, but the back tapes are erased after seven days and this
policy is continuing. As of several weeks ago (when B. Williams first sent
out notification to Pete Van de Gohn and the IT staff in Houston) the Lotus
Notes server is being preserved as follows:  the auto purge and the delete
functions on the computers of certain key personnel have been disabled for
certain EES personnel(e.g. Sunde and Benevides).  In addition, more
recently, the auto purge function was disabled on the computers of
additional personnel (the Golden Bear team) who use the system.  As of
today, Pete will disable the delete function for those additional personnel
as well.
*	Going forward, we discussed several different policies that EES
might institute.  First, we discussed the idea of instituting a policy like
that in place at EPMI in Portland (i.e. preserving the daily back up tapes
that are already being made- but overwritten after a week or so-in the
ordinary course of business).  This policy will create a significant amount
of information that will be difficult and expensive to search if it is
requested.  However, it is apparently consistent with the policy in place at
EPMI- Portland and is possible to do on both e-mail systems. Second, as an
alternative to preserving backup tapes we discussed disabling the delete
function on the computers of key personnel. This is now being done for the
Lotus Notes system. However we understand that the exchange/Legacy system
may not have an auto purge function. Jon will check whether the delete
disabling function can be accomplished on the exchange/Legacy system and
report back. This second alternative preserves e-mail that will be
relatively easy to search for production. However, it may be difficult to
implement for California personal on the legacy e-mail system. Third, we
discussed instructing key EES personnel at issue to move all potentially
responsive e-mails into folders on the system which may they be protected,
reproduced and reviewed.This would be the least burdensome potentially
leaves us open to the "fox is guarding the henhouse" argument by the AG.
*	Data Servers:We discussed data servers briefly. All personnel are on
different servers for their word documents and spread sheets. This system
has no autopurge function. However, the only way that a document can be
deleted is if a user actually deliberately deletes it from the system.
Accordingly, there seems less need to initiate further backup of this
server.
*	Finally, we agreed EES lawyers should send e-mails to all key EES
personnel confirming our earlier instruction to them that they not delete
e-mail documents or messages. A draft e-mail on this subject follows:

	This e-mail confirms that EES has instituted an interim document
retention policy as a result of the investigation 	commenced by the
California Attorney General.	Until further notice, please do not delete
any non-personal e-mail from 	your inbox or any documents from the data
servers. In lieu of deleting any of your e-mail please transfer it to a
folder in 	your e-mail system for storage. If you need instructions on
how to do this please call ---------.

We did not learn of this tentative until after 4:30 today, although it was
probably posted sometime earlier in the afternoon.  The local rule states
that a party who wishes to argue the tentative shall notify opposing counsel
before 4:30. We called their attorneys after 4:30, but before 5 PM. I
reached Martin Goyette, counsel for the AG personally by phone shortly after
five, and notified him of our intention to argue. He claimed the AG would
not appear to argue given late notice. I have notified him by fax of our
intention to argue.

	Attached is copy of the letter from the Deputy AG, which purports to
summarize the status of EES's planned response to the AG's subpoenas. As
these things go it is not grossly inaccurate. I suggest we send a clarifying
response that makes the following points:

	. All discussions with the AG, and any interim production of
documents, are made without prejudice to our rights to stand on any and all
objections to the subpoena if the AG files an enforcement action.
	. We have more objections to their proposed protective order than
are reflected in their letter. However, we will modify their proposed
protective order and send them an order acceptable to govern the production
of certain in-state EES documents in the next few days.
	.We are in the process of providing notice to all commercial
accounts (without regard for any other definition) that their contracts have
been requested and may be produced to the AG. Whether our duty, if any, to
resist production under the terms of some of these contacts has been
discharged is unclear and we don't agree that it has been discharged.
	. Without waiving any of our objections to either the investigation
or the subpoena, we will voluntarily produce documents which reside within
California which are clearly and unambiguously called for by the subpoena ,
on the condition that we reach an acceptable confidentiality order to govern
their production. We are ready to begin doing so on or about July 30.

	I suggest we send this letter before the close of business today.
Please let me know if you think we should modify this position, or add to
it.

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when
hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1.   The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2.   What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3.   The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for
failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4.   Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this
policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

Re:  Data Retention

     "Due to the various regulatory proceedings ongoing in California, please do not delete any email or electronic data that relate to the California market.  Deletion of such data could subject both you and the Company to allegations of deliberate destruction of evidence, contempt of court, and civil and criminal penalties.  To preserve such data please create a folder entitled "California Data" and move all emails and other data to that folder.  Thank you for your cooperation."

Subject:	Discussion of document retention policy for EES

 	Bob Williams, Andrew Edison, Michael Molland, Amanda Smith, and two
IT professionals working with EES, Jon Eastlund and Pete van de Gohn, today
discussed a going forward document retention policy for EES as a result of
the California AG's subpoena. This is a summary of our discussion.
*	Agreement with AG with respect to EPMI-Portland: I (per my
conversation with Gary Fergus) confirmed that the document retention policy
that was negotiated in December, 2000 with the AG with respect to EPMI in
Portland is as follows:  All employees are instructed not to delete any
e-mail for 24 hours.  Each 24 hours a backup "snapshot" of the entire e-mail
server in Portland is taken.  After 24 hours, employees may delete e-mail.
This policy has been in place since mid-December and back-up tapes should
exist for e-mail for each day from mid-December through the present.
*	Description of E-mail server organization within EES:   All EES
employees are on one of two e-mail systems: (1) the exchange server/Legacy
system or (2) Lotus Notes.  The exchange/Legacy system is run off of three
servers located in San Ramon, California,  Costa Mesa, California,  and
Phoenix, Arizona.  The Lotus Notes server is in Houston.  The majority of
EES personnel in California probably are on the exchange/Legacy server, but
there is no way of knowing who is which server without individually
checking.   EES personnel who were originally hired in California probably
use the Legacy  system. Generally,  the only in-California personnel who use
the Lotus Notes system are those who were originally hired by EES to work
outside of California. Virtually all EES employees outside California use
the Lotus Notes system.
*	Current e-mail retention of Legacy system: The customary practice is
to keep daily back up tapes, which are over written weekly, as well as one
weekly snapshot of the system, which is overwritten after 30 days. As of
last week, the exchange/Legacy server is being preserved as follows:  the
daily and weekly tapes are no longer being overwritten and are being
preserved by Jon Eastlund.  (Jon is checking with his subordinate in Costa
Mesa to confirm that this is also being done in Costa Mesa).  Jon reports
that the earliest weekly back up tape which is still preserved dates from
May 25th. He is keeping that tape in San Ramon until it can be picked up by
Brobeck.
*	Retention of e-mail of Lotus Notes System: The Lotus Notes server is
backed up every day, but the back tapes are erased after seven days and this
policy is continuing. As of several weeks ago (when B. Williams first sent
out notification to Pete Van de Gohn and the IT staff in Houston) the Lotus
Notes server is being preserved as follows:  the auto purge and the delete
functions on the computers of certain key personnel have been disabled for
certain EES personnel(e.g. Sunde and Benevides).  In addition, more
recently, the auto purge function was disabled on the computers of
additional personnel (the Golden Bear team) who use the system.  As of
today, Pete will disable the delete function for those additional personnel
as well.
*	Going forward, we discussed several different policies that EES
might institute.  First, we discussed the idea of instituting a policy like
that in place at EPMI in Portland (i.e. preserving the daily back up tapes
that are already being made- but overwritten after a week or so-in the
ordinary course of business).  This policy will create a significant amount
of information that will be difficult and expensive to search if it is
requested.  However, it is apparently consistent with the policy in place at
EPMI- Portland and is possible to do on both e-mail systems. Second, as an
alternative to preserving backup tapes we discussed disabling the delete
function on the computers of key personnel. This is now being done for the
Lotus Notes system. However we understand that the exchange/Legacy system
may not have an auto purge function. Jon will check whether the delete
disabling function can be accomplished on the exchange/Legacy system and
report back. This second alternative preserves e-mail that will be
relatively easy to search for production. However, it may be difficult to
implement for California personal on the legacy e-mail system. Third, we
discussed instructing key EES personnel at issue to move all potentially
responsive e-mails into folders on the system which may they be protected,
reproduced and reviewed.This would be the least burdensome potentially
leaves us open to the "fox is guarding the henhouse" argument by the AG.
*	Data Servers:We discussed data servers briefly. All personnel are on
different servers for their word documents and spread sheets. This system
has no autopurge function. However, the only way that a document can be
deleted is if a user actually deliberately deletes it from the system.
Accordingly, there seems less need to initiate further backup of this
server.
*	Finally, we agreed EES lawyers should send e-mails to all key EES
personnel confirming our earlier instruction to them that they not delete
e-mail documents or messages. A draft e-mail on this subject follows:

	This e-mail confirms that EES has instituted an interim document
retention policy as a result of the investigation 	commenced by the
California Attorney General.	Until further notice, please do not delete
any non-personal e-mail from 	your inbox or any documents from the data
servers. In lieu of deleting any of your e-mail please transfer it to a
folder in 	your e-mail system for storage. If you need instructions on
how to do this please call ---------.

	Bob: California law would permits a party to litigation to make a
motion asking the court to shift the cost of restoring the tapes, if unduly
burdensome, to a party requesting the information.  Greyhound Corporation v.
Superior Court (1961), 56 Cal.2d 355, 379.  In Greyhound, the California
Supreme Court held, where a valid objection "to disclosure is that it
entails an undue burden on the other party, the trial court should give
consideration to various alternatives provided in the statute.  Requiring
such party to pay the costs of disclosure is not the only such method."  The
balancing factors suggested by the Greyhound court include the purpose of
the information sought, the effect that disclosure would have on the parties
and the trial, the nature of the objections urged, the hardship of
production, the relative ability of the parties to retrieve the information
sought, and the court's authority to make another order using another form
of disclosure or denying the requests completely.
	Despite this case, I suspect we will have a difficult convincing a
California Superior Court that the state's AG should pay Enron's cost of
editing information from its backup tapes, especially if the AG can concoct
an argument that he needs them because Enron has not followed some document
retention policy or protocol.

   Subject:  Status report regarding subpenas

   This summarizes the status of our work in response to the subpoenas
   served
   on Enron Corp by Dunn's committee and on EES by the AG.

      Today's meeting with Dave Parquet: Amanda Smith and I met with Dave
   Parquet at the Enron Corp offices in San Francisco late this afternoon
   and
   then talked with him this evening. He generally described the documents
   in
   the office. He describes most as confidential or proprietary. He will
   assemble the team leaders in the office and meet with Amanda and me and
   two
   other associates Monday morning. We should be able to complete a
   snapshot of
   the documents in the office by mid Tuesday. Our discussions raised the
   following issues:

      . Dave said Enron has a small generating subsidiary located near
   Palm Springs, Enron Wind Energy. It generates and sells power to
   utilities.
   The Enron subpoena asks for generation data. We will contact them Monday
   by
   phone.

      .EES has a small office in Long Beach. Amanda will talk to their
   employees Monday.

      . A Master Limited Partnership, EOTT Energy, also has an office in
   Long Beach. They may be a subsidiary of Enron Corp. Please let us know
   if we
   should contact him.

      . Many documents in San Francisco are covered by confidentiality
   agreements with Enron's clients. Dave said the confidentiality of these
   documents are not clear on their face and we should involve an Enron
   attorney in Portland -he suggested Karen Jones- to work on this issue
   with
   us.


      Document Retention: David said he is concerned that there is no
   clear corporate guideline for e-mail retention in his office. We should
   send
   him and the directors in that office (as well as all EES directors)  a
   clear
   directive as soon as possible. For the time being he is following oral
   instructions not to delete e-mail or other documents. Earlier, Amanda
   talked
   the EES IT manager, who said that it is not possible to automatically
   save
   e-mail from most EES personnel in California (those who are on the
   legacy
   e-mail system). Until we solve this problem I suggest we retain the
   daily
   back-up tapes made  for the legacy system (just as we are doing for our
   Portland office).

      Telephone call with AG's office  regarding the EES subpoena: This
   afternoon I talked to Hirem Pattel, a deputy AG who is temporarily in
   charge
   of the EES investigation. I told him we would produce some documents
   without
   waiving our objections, but needed to discuss any production with him
   beforehand. I repeated Bob's offer to meet next Friday. He said they
   would
   not meet with us until we again responded to the subpoena and said in
   writing we would produce documents. I told him we had no obligation to
   do
   that and wanted to meet with them first. He then said he would have his
   supervisor call me early next week.

      Directives to California officers: All the EES and Enron people we
   have talked with in the past two weeks have been cooperative. Given the
   time
   crunch, however, it would be helpful if an Enron lawyer could contact
   California officers and ask them to make special efforts to help us with
   the
   document review. The people to contact are Messrs. Reilly,
   Parquet;McDonald,
   Mara,Wright, van Ulden, and the head of the Enron Wind Energy Office.

      Review of EES documents at San Ramon: Amanda Smith spent the morning
   today there and gathered documents underlying the UC litigation. Lockyer
   knows this litigation and will probably use our positions in it to gauge
   our
   compliance with any production agreement. We will complete an assessment
   of
   these documents early next week.  We also found and took custody of the
   backup tape made in San Ramon May 25. Apparently no similar tape exists
   for
   Costa Mesa. We will identify and obtain earliest back-up tape that
   exists at
   that office.

      As we review documents for privilege we should know the identity of
   all Enron lawyers. Bob, could someone in your office act as a contact
   person
   to supply us with this and similar information?

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. 
"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
"It was an emergency," Fishman said. 
"We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
"All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

> 	We met and talked to EES officers this week on three occasions to

> California. This memo discusses those three meetings:
>
>  I. SUMMARY:
> The following people attended these meetings:
> *	6/19/01 Conference Call (M. Molland, A. Smith, J. Wright, T. Reilly,
> D. van Ulden; R. Williams)
> *	6/20/01 Meeting, at EES San Ramon (M. Molland, A. Smith, P.
> Meringolo, D. van Ulden, T. Reilly, J. Eastlund, M. Ahad)
> *	6/21/01 Meeting, at EES Costa Mesa (A. Smith, J. Wright, T. Taylor)
>
> General Conclusions:
> 	It appears that while there may be a large volume of responsive
> documents in both San Ramon (SR) and Costa Mesa (CM) (perhaps as much as
> 50-100 boxes in each office, depending on how broadly we construe the
> requests for information for EES's "communications regarding decisions" to
> switch customers back to the utilities), there are relatively few highly
> sensitive internal Enron documents which could be used to evidence the
> alleged anti-trust violations or "price-gouging."  However, many of the
> documents may contain proprietary customer information.
> *	In all of our meetings with EES personnel, we emphasized what
> constitutes a responsive document from a "territorial" perspective.  (i.e.
> only documents in hard copy form in SR or CM or in electronic form on the
> SR or CM servers.)  It appears that many account managers regularly
> download and print documents from the Document data base (housed in
> Houston) or the EES intranet.  Going forward, it will important to
> emphasize that in collecting documents for possible production, EES
> personnel should not download from these sources.
> *	We also emphasized that EES personnel should not currently be
> physically collecting documents, rather they should be assessing what
> sensitive documents exist, locating responsive documents and NOT deleting
> or destroying responsive material.
> *	Mojhan Ahad and Tamara Taylor (Admins assigned to D. van Ulden and
> J. Wright respectively) will be coordinating any document production that
> becomes necessary.  It appears that a slightly different approach may be
> necessary to recover responsive documents in SR and CM.  The account
> managers in CM appear to have more independence with respect to managing
> their accounts.  It may be necessary to speak with them directly.  In SR,
> it appears that it may be possible to collect the large majority of
> responsive documents directly from Tom, Dirk and Mojhan.
> *	Other than the personnel at SR and CM, there are other EES personnel
> in California that we may need to meet.  Specifically, Sue Mara and Jeff
> Dasovich with regulatory affairs in San Francisco and several Originators
> in Long Beach (and possibly in Northern California?) who work from home.
> This latter group may be particularly important as they appear to have
> some account management responsibility on natural gas accounts and most
> likely have some responsive documents.
> *	It is unclear the extent to which the subpoena is common knowledge.
> Dirk and Tom in SR stated that they had not revealed its existence to
> their staff.  In CM, Jim had told his staff about the existence of the
> subpoena but had not told them who it was from or what it referenced.  If
> we proceed with the collection of responsive documents, we will need to
> develop a policy with respect to the confidentiality of the subpoena.
> *	It appears (based on conversations with Jim in CM) that although
> general power point presentations are made up for meetings with customers
> (in Houston, apparently), each account manager may change or focus the
> presentation for a specific customer.  Therefore, each presentation will
> constitute a different document and must be produced separately.
> *	Note on "California Crisis" database, Golden Bear and the de-DASR
> documents:  These documents are probably the most sensitive, but many may
> be protected on attorney-client, litigation or settlement privilege
> grounds.  There are four Golden Bear team members in California:  Tom,
> Dirk, Jim and George Waidelich.  It seems in SR, the Golden Bear documents
> are only in the possession of Dirk and Tom.  However, in CM, account
> managers may have some access to them.
>
> II. Recommendations Going Forward:
> *	Collect and assess most sensitive documents. These would include the
> Golden Bear and de-DASR documents.  These should be collected next week in
> order to begin a legal analysis of privilege issues.  In SR, this
> collection can most likely be done by Mojhan.  In CM, it may be necessary
> to interview individual account managers.
> *	Meet with "floating" Originators in Long Beach and potentially in
> Northern California to assess if they possess any responsive documents.  A
> brief conversation with the San Francisco Regulatory Affairs people (Sue
> and Jeff) and with George Waidelich would also be warranted.  This should
> also be done immediately.
> *	Meet with Tamara and Mojhan to develop a strategy for locating and
> copying responsive hard copy documents.  This is underway.
> *	Copy the hard drive folders of key personnel onto CDs.  These
> folders can then be reviewed for responsive documents by Brobeck attorneys
> if a production becomes necessary.
> *	Assess the extent to which responsive data may reside in archival
> storage sites (e.g. Iron Mountain in CM).  Because it may be
> time-consuming to retrieve documents from these sites, we should know now
> whether that will be necessary.
> *	Assess the potential implications of the EES intranet on our
> production obligations.
> *	Begin developing a legal strategy to protect documents that are not
> privileged but contain confidential proprietary customer information.
> *	Ensure document retention policy for appropriate personnel is in
> place.
>
> DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS, ORGANIZATION, AND RETRIEVAL PLAN
>
> III. -Mail and Data Storage- Generally
> During our conversation with Jon Eastlund, Manager for SR and CM e-mail
> servers, and Pete Vandegon, Manager for SR and CM data servers, we
> discussed the email and document retention policies.
> Each document has its own server located at its California office. E-mail
> remains on the server until it is deleted by EES user.  EES user can also
> move e-mail onto their hard drive and delete from the server.  Every day
> (from Monday to Thursday) a "snapshot" is taken of the e-mail servers and
> is preserved on tapes at approximately 11pm.  When this snapshot is taken,
> the corresponding day in the previous week is erased and written over.
> Therefore, at 11pm on Wednesday, the snapshot of the previous Wednesday is
> written over.  Similarly, each Friday, a snapshot of the server is taken,
> writing over the Friday tape of the previous month.  In other words, there
> exists at any time a daily snapshot of the past week and a weekly snapshot
> of the last month.  Therefore, if an e-mail is received on a Tuesday and
> deleted on a Wednesday, that e-mail would appear in the Tuesday daily
> snapshot which would be preserved until the following Tuesday, but would
> not appear on the weekly snapshot.  As of 6/20/01, J. Eastlund is no
> longer "overwriting" daily or weekly tapes and is making "new" tapes going
> forward. He was instructed to keep all backup copies now in existence.
> Pete Vandegon is sending information via e-mail on the data retention
> system but, as of 6/20/01, is no longer "overwriting" as part of the
> backup process.
>
> IV. Discussion of Responsive Documents by Subpoena Document Request
>
> 1.	Contracts.
>
> There will obviously be a great number of these contracts, only a few of
> which are in the public domain, and we will need to collect the contracts
> from both CM and SR as there appears to be little overlap in their files.
> During production, it will be extremely important to emphasize to EES
> personnel not to download contracts from the Houston based Documentum
> database (the typical procedure).
> 2.	Forward Contracts (looking forward)
>
> Personnel in SR and CM are convinced that all of these contracts are
> housed in Houston or housed in California with another Enron entity.
> However, Jim suggested that we check with the floating Originators
> regarding this category.
> 3.	Forward Contracts (looking backwards)
>
> Personnel in SR and CM are convinced that all of these contracts are
> housed in Houston or housed in California with another Enron entity.
> However, Jim suggested that we check with the floating Originators
> regarding this category.
> 4.	Documents Sufficient to Identify Each Purchase of Electricity or
> Ancillary Services
>
> SR and CM have no involvement with purchasing and therefore responsive
> documents would be in Houston.  Again, however, it appears that the
> floating Originators may have some responsive information.
> 5.	Documents re: Portfolio of Electricity Supply Sources
>
> There appear to be very few responsive documents.  Some customers receive
> an annual report of the makeup of their power supply (e.g. 20% green
> power, 15% hydro, etc.) but the reports are not particularized - they do
> not list where the hydro came from, etc.  There may also be power point
> presentations to customers or correspondence with customers about sourcing
> of electricity.
> 6.	Documents re: Electricity Purchase Risk Assessment.
>
> Potentially the Golden Bear and UC/CSU documents are responsive here.
> There is at least one power point presentation on the risks associated
> with relying on the PX and possibly other presentations to customers on
> market conditions.
> 7.	Documents re: Strategies or Business Plans
>
> The Golden Bear documents are potentially responsive, but generally SR and
> CM were not involved in this kind of strategizing.
> 8.	Documents and communications relating to the de-DASR
>
> It may be possible to read this narrowly and limit it to documents
> regarding the decision to de-DASR.  All evidence suggests that this
> decision was made in Houston and SR and CM were not involved.  Read
> broadly, this request (and 9 and 10) would encompass a large number of
> documents including all communications with customers re: the decision and
> possibly a number of power point presentations on the changing market
> conditions (perhaps created by the Value Enhancement Group in Houston.)
> For categories 8-10, Dirk suggests that we consider whether documents and
> communications about billing complications would be covered.  If so, the
> volume of documents increases dramatically.
> 9.	See #8 above
> 10.	See #8 above
> 11.	Documents re: Causes of Price Increases.
>
> Several responsive power point presentations on market conditions.
> Internal documents, including weekly reports by Paul Smith from November
> 2000 - February 2001 and possibly emails relating to UC/CSU.
> 12.	Documents re: Revenue Maximizing Strategies
>
> The Golden Bear documents are responsive here as well as a few documents
> in the nature of pitches to clients (in CM).
> 13.	Documents re: Sales of Electricity
>
> No responsive documents in SR or CM.
> 14.	Contracts Prematurely Terminated
>
> It appears that there are currently are none (although that may change
> going forward) on the electricity side.  Several contracts may have been
> terminated, but it was due to default by the customer and therefore wasn't
> "premature."  On the natural gas side, there may be prematurely terminated
> contracts.  This question should be put to the floating Originators.  Note
> this request goes back to 1992.
> 15.	See #14
> 16.	Org Charts
>
> Easy to collect and uncontroversial.
> 17.	Documents re: Risk Management of Trading Activities
>
> Few responsive documents; possibly only the Golden Bear documents.
> 18.	Org Charts (Risk Management)
>
> See 16, except this request is phrased poorly and we may be able to
> produce nothing here as the charts have never been organized in the way
> the AG suggests.
> 19.	Documents re: Development of Charters and Risk Management
> Objectives.
>
> Few responsive documents; possibly only Golden Bear documents
> 20.	Documents re: Natural Gas positions
>
> No responsive documents in CM or SR.  This question should be put to the
> Originators
> 21.	See #20.
>
>
>
> IV.  Specific Hard Copy Documents Identified in San Ramon as potentially
> responsive
>
> *	Back-up tapes from email servers for May 25, June 1, 8, 13, 14, 15,
> 18, and 19
> *	In Houston, a set of back-up tapes from California email servers
> from December 2000
> *	Billing documents
> *	One binder containing "Top 40" contracts
> *	Five CD set, dated July 7, 2000 containing EEMC contracts and
> correspondence
> *	Electronic version of documents related to the returning customers
> to the Utilities.  These documents are on Mojgan Ahad's (Dirk's
> administrative assistant) hard drive in files labeled "California Rapid
> Response" and "California Strike Force."  These documents include:
> *	Form letters
> *	Lists of all meters at all customers
> *	Q&A's
> *	EDI forms
> *	Power Point Presentation
> *	Reports of status distributed daily by email (created by Peter Vint
> originally and Mojgan Ahad
> *	Mojgan has emails on hard drive re:
> *	"Golden Bear" -- this file, I believe, contains emails sent on
> behalf of Chris Holmes
> *	"CA Strike Force" -- which contains the reports re: return of
> customers which were distributed to people in Houston and California from
> February 4, 2001 to April 18, 2001
> *	Files related to status of EDI's (re: return of customers to PG&E).
> Presently kept by Summer Intern, Kerri Bernstein.
> *	Original signed documents related to the returning of customers to
> utilities may be with Doug Hoth and Tom Reilly and maybe with other
> account managers.
> *	Each account manager has hard copy files of documents related to
> each contract (including the contract itself) and likely has electronic
> files containing emails re: each account.  This is based upon my quick
> review of the files of two managers -- Shawn Green and Jim Kuegle.  There
> is no standardized, company-wide policy about files nor is there a central
> filing system.
> *	A few boxes of former account managers.  However, documents related
> to specific accounts were distributed to the new account managers.  The
> hard drives of the former account managers were deleted, but Mojgan
> believes that the important emails were forwarded to the new account
> managers.
> *	A few boxes from other contracts acquired from PG&E Energy Trading.
> *	Current and Old Organization charts
> *	There may be relevant documents located in San Francisco, especially
> related to contracts for the purchase of energy.
>
> V.  Description of Electronic Documents located in San Ramon
>
> EES in San Ramon utilizes three types of servers:  Mail Servers; Data
> Servers and Web Servers.  For the purpose of the subpoena, we focused on
> the mail servers and data servers.
>
> 	A.  Mail Servers
>
> EES employees in San Ramon and Costa Mesa use Microsoft Outlook on three
> "exchange" servers located in California.  John Eastland is the
> administrator for this server.
>
> EES employees outside California use Lotus Notes.  The Lotus Notes
> server(s) are located in Houston, TX.
>
> The retention policy for the exchange servers located in California was as
> follows:
>
> Each day Monday through Thursday is copied and saved on a tape for one
> week.  Each week, the tape is overwritten.  Each Friday is copied and
> saved for 4 weeks.
>
> Thus, as of yesterday, EES had back-up tapes for W 6/13; Th  6/14; M 6/18;
> and T 6/19 and for Fridays 5/25; 6/1; 6/8 and 6/15.
>
> Apparently, a set of back-up tapes were sent to Houston, TX at the end of
> December for an FCC investigation.
>
> Going forward, EES will retain back-up tapes for each day, until
> instructed otherwise.
>
> Back-up tapes are made at 11:00 p.m.  Email messages that remain on the
> server at that time are copied.  Email messages that have been deleted or
> moved onto a person's individual hard drive are not saved.  Currently,
> there is no policy for retaining emails.  We have told Tim Reilly and Dirk
> Van Ulden to retain their emails and to identify any other persons who
> should do so.
>
> 	B.  Data Servers
>
> Electronic documents are maintained on two data servers.  One in San Ramon
> (EES SRO-FS2) one in Costa Mesa (EES HOU-CM1).  Generally speaking,
> documents on the H;/ and J:/ drives appear to be maintained on these
> servers.
>
> The IT person in Houston, Pete will provide us with the retention policy
> regarding these two servers.
>
> EES has 292 Windows NT servers and 31 UNIX servers.  Employees in
> California access the servers located in Houston, although it is unclear
> how many employees do so.  This much is known:
>
> *	Mojgan has access to a program called Documentum, which is an online
> document storage program, located on a Houston server.
> *	All account managers have access to CMS -- Customer Management
> System -- located on Houston servers.  This contains account information,
> service requests, information on customer visits, etc.
> *	Malcom Adkins has access to materials related to marketing located
> on Houston servers.
> *	If a person leaves California and relocates to Houston (or vice
> versa), that person continues to have access to servers in California (and
> vice versa).
> *	Project managers and developers have access to Expedition and
> SureTrack applications located on Houston servers.
> *	Other persons may have there computers "mapped" to Houston servers,
> but IT would need to look at each person's computers to find out who does
> and/or John Eastland would need to look at requests for access to those
> servers
>
> VI.  Summary of the Return of the Customers to the Utilities
>
> According to Mojgan, the decision to return customers to the utilities was
> made by people in Houston.  She knows of no documents relating to that
> decision.  However, the documents relating to the execution of the return
> of customers are on Mojgan's hard drive.  There is no file containing
> copies of the original letters which were sent, although Tom Reilly and
> Doug Hoth may have saved a copy.  (A copy of the letter sent to UC is
> attached to the Reilly declaration).  EES called this project either
> "California Strike Force" or "California Rapid Response."  In February,
> people from Houston arrived in California and conducted the return of the
> customers by making calls, sending letters, etc.  Most of the calls were
> made by Houston people.  Some calls were made by California personnel --
> Doug Hoth and Renee Lazure.  Peter Vint remained in California for two
> weeks, creating and sending status reports.  He left, and Mojgan continued
> to create and distribute the status reports.

Subject:	Status report regarding subpenas

This summarizes the status of our work in response to the subpoenas served
on Enron Corp by Dunn's committee and on EES by the AG.

	Today's meeting with Dave Parquet: Amanda Smith and I met with Dave
Parquet at the Enron Corp offices in San Francisco late this afternoon and
then talked with him this evening. He generally described the documents in
the office. He describes most as confidential or proprietary. He will
assemble the team leaders in the office and meet with Amanda and me and two
other associates Monday morning. We should be able to complete a snapshot of
the documents in the office by mid Tuesday. Our discussions raised the
following issues:

	. Dave said Enron has a small generating subsidiary located near
Palm Springs, Enron Wind Energy. It generates and sells power to utilities.
The Enron subpoena asks for generation data. We will contact them Monday by
phone.

	.EES has a small office in Long Beach. Amanda will talk to their
employees Monday.

	. A Master Limited Partnership, EOTT Energy, also has an office in
Long Beach. They may be a subsidiary of Enron Corp. Please let us know if we
should contact him.

	. Many documents in San Francisco are covered by confidentiality
agreements with Enron's clients. Dave said the confidentiality of these
documents are not clear on their face and we should involve an Enron
attorney in Portland -he suggested Karen Jones- to work on this issue with
us.


	Document Retention: David said he is concerned that there is no
clear corporate guideline for e-mail retention in his office. We should send
him and the directors in that office (as well as all EES directors)  a clear
directive as soon as possible. For the time being he is following oral
instructions not to delete e-mail or other documents. Earlier, Amanda talked
the EES IT manager, who said that it is not possible to automatically save
e-mail from most EES personnel in California (those who are on the legacy
e-mail system). Until we solve this problem I suggest we retain the daily
back-up tapes made  for the legacy system (just as we are doing for our
Portland office).

	Telephone call with AG's office  regarding the EES subpoena: This
afternoon I talked to Hirem Pattel, a deputy AG who is temporarily in charge
of the EES investigation. I told him we would produce some documents without
waiving our objections, but needed to discuss any production with him
beforehand. I repeated Bob's offer to meet next Friday. He said they would
not meet with us until we again responded to the subpoena and said in
writing we would produce documents. I told him we had no obligation to do
that and wanted to meet with them first. He then said he would have his
supervisor call me early next week.

	Directives to California officers: All the EES and Enron people we
have talked with in the past two weeks have been cooperative. Given the time
crunch, however, it would be helpful if an Enron lawyer could contact
California officers and ask them to make special efforts to help us with the
document review. The people to contact are Messrs. Reilly, Parquet;McDonald,
Mara,Wright, van Ulden, and the head of the Enron Wind Energy Office.

	Review of EES documents at San Ramon: Amanda Smith spent the morning
today there and gathered documents underlying the UC litigation. Lockyer
knows this litigation and will probably use our positions in it to gauge our
compliance with any production agreement. We will complete an assessment of
these documents early next week.  We also found and took custody of the
backup tape made in San Ramon May 25. Apparently no similar tape exists for
Costa Mesa. We will identify and obtain earliest back-up tape that exists at
that office.

	As we review documents for privilege we should know the identity of
all Enron lawyers. Bob, could someone in your office act as a contact person
to supply us with this and similar information?

Michael, you may have already sent this.  It looks fine to me with one slight caveat.  Does this imply that we have already sent the letters notifying customers of our intent to produce copies of the contracts?  We have not yet.  Also, in a few instances we have to get a written waiver from the customer--notice will not be enough.

Subject:	RE: Status of EES Response to AG Subpoenas

Here is a suggested draft of a response to the deputy AG's letter. We plan
to send it tomorrow afternoon after we receive your comments.

Paul E. Stein, Deputy Attorney General
State of California
Office of the Attorney General
455 Golden Gate Avenue, Suite 11000
San Francisco, CA  94102
Dear Mr. Stein:
This responds to your letter of July 13, 2001, which I received on July 16,
regarding your discussions with Mike Kirby and me on behalf of Enron Energy
Services (EES).  This will confirm that you agreed that our discussions with
the Office of the Attorney General on the subject of its subpoenas served
upon EES are without prejudice to, and will not waive, any rights by EES to
object to either this investigation or the subpoenas in any subsequent
action or proceeding.  Your letter of July 13, 2001, notes some, but by no
means all, of EES's objections to the subpoenas.  Without attempting to
catalogue these objections, the following points in your July 13 letter
merit mention:
*	Confidentiality order:  This confirms we will provide you with a
suitable alternative confidentiality order for your review this week.
*	Customer notification:  EES has been, and continues to be in the
process of, providing appropriate notice to all commercial customers
(without regard for any other definition) in California with regard to your
request for their contracts.  We do not agree that our duty, if any, to
resist production under the terms of these contracts has been discharged.
*	Territoriality:  Our objections to your requests for out of state
documents and the testimony by out of state residents arises under
California statutes, common law, and California and the Constitution of the
United States.
*	Document repository:  We do not believe the Attorney General is
entitled to production of any documents other than at a central location.
*	Production:  Without waiving any of our objections to either the
Attorney General's investigation or the subpoena, EES is prepared to produce
documents which reside within California which are unambiguously called for
by the subpoena served on June 27, 2001, on the condition that we reach a
mutually acceptable confidentiality order to govern their production.
Assuming a mutually agreeable protective order, we are ready to begin doing
so on or about July 30.
Thank you for your courtesies in these matters.
Sincerely,
Michael E. Molland

	We learned from Bob today that the AG, in an apparent address our
objection to the lack of personal service, served EES's designated agent for
service of process by hand on May 27 with a subpoena for documents identical
to that served by mail on EES on May 25. Although we have not yet seen it,
we are told the subpoena has a response date of June 29. We recommend
treating this service as a withdrawal of the May 25 subpoena and responding
to it as we did to the earlier subpoena served by mail. Assuming this
subpoena is treated as a discovery subpoena under California law it is
technically defective since it does not allow ten days for a response. We
recommend additionally objecting to it on this basis.
	Attached are draft responses which implement this approach. We
propose to serve them by hand tomorrow.

Rich,
	I just received a phone call from the IT department at EPMI.  They
have two computers which require immediate maintenance.  The first is a
desktop of an individual who sits at the front desk.  Her work station is
inoperable and part of the fix may be to format the hard drive.  Second,
there is a laptop for someone who is not a trader, which will not boot.  In
order to repair that machine, they may have to format the hard drive as
well.  At the present time, there is no easy way to copy the contents of the
hard drive before those machines are repaired, because they are inoperable.

	Based on our prior discussions, it is my understanding that for
operational needs such as these, EPMI is free to repair these machines
notwithstanding the request for preservation of data.

	If for any reason you have a different understanding, please let me
know immediately.

Sincerely,
Gary Fergus

Here is the letter I was referring to yesterday sent by Reliant's Sacramento
counsel to Senator Dunn.  In paragraph no. 1, Charles Stevens refers to how
small Reliant's market share is in the WSCC power market.  He suggests that
the Committee obtain the entire database, which reflects all bidders in the
market.  He goes on to say that the information from obtaining all of the
data would give a far more accurate picture than could be obtained by
looking at the data of a few "generators".

This letter plus some comments that Larry Drivon made to Michael Molland
gave rise to the inference that Reliant's counsel, Charles Stevens, may have
been suggesting in his discussions with Senator Dunn's staff that Enron
should be included in the process.  It may be that the inference will turn
out not to be accurate.  That is all the information we have on the subject.


Thanks.

Subject:	FW: Status Report of Enron Corp and EES document identification and production efforts in response to California investigative subpoenas

	We are continuing to identify and review potentially responsive
documents within California called for by the subpoena issued by Dunn's
Committee to Enron Corp and by the California AG's subpoenas to Enron Energy
Services. Peter Meringolo and Amanda Smith are leading this effort at our
office. This is our report on the status of this document identification and
our plans, subject to your direction,  to continue this effort next week.
The last section of the memo poses certain logistical questions and issues
regarding the production to  Dunn's Committee that Mike Kirby should
address as soon as possible.
I. Status of EES' Response to Subpoena from AG
As we previously reported, we have completed a preliminary investigation of
documents in the EES's offices in California which are responsive to the
subpoena from the attorney general.  Below is a report of (1) documents
collected (2) documents we need to collect soon; and (3) action items which
we still need to do in order to identify responsive documents.
		A.	Documents Collected
We have copies of the following documents:
*	Contracts from the San Ramon office
*	Contracts and documents relating to the contracts from Costa Mesa
office
		B.	Documents to Collect
We previously identified the following relevant documents.  However, we have
not yet collected them into one central location:
*	Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities.
These documents are on Mojgan Ahad's hard drive in files labeled "California
Rapid Response" and "California Strike Force" and email.
*	"Golden Bear" documents in San Ramon, Costa Mesa and Long Beach
*	Files related to status of EDI's (re: return of customers to PG&E).
Presently kept by Summer Intern, Kerri Bernstein.
*	Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities.
These documents are on Mojgan Ahad's hard drive in files labeled "California
Rapid Response" and "California Strike Force" and email.
*	"Golden Bear" documents in San Ramon, Costa Mesa and Long Beach
*	Files related to status of EDI's (re: return of customers to PG&E).
Presently kept by Summer Intern, Kerri Bernstein.
*	Documents "related to" each contract in the possession of each
account manager in San Ramon
*	Current and Old Organization charts
		C.	Action Items
To complete our review of the relevant documents in California, we plan to
do the following:
*	Review emails and hard drives of Tom Riley, Dirk van Ulden, Mojgan
Ahad, and Jim Wright
*	Interview, and review documents in the possession of, "Originators"
in Long Beach


II. Status of Enron Corporation's Response to Subpoena from Senator Dunn
We are prepared to produce more than 30,000 pages of documents to the
Sacramento repository on Monday in response to the subpoena from Senator
Dunn.  This memorandum sets forth the remaining issues to be resolved before
Enron's production of documents in California is complete.
This memorandum is divided into three sections:  (1) substantive issues to
be resolved; (2) documents remaining to be reviewed, and (3) logistical
issues to be addressed by Mike Kirby.
		A.	Substantive Issues
We have prepared and sent to Mike Kirby and Richard Sanders and others a
packet of documents which we need to discuss as soon as possible.  We need
guidance about whether we ought to produce these types of documents.  These
documents include:
*	Bids made to DWR & ISO.  The subpoena calls for bids made to the ISO
and PX, and we assume that this means "bid data."  However, Enron did submit
bids to provide for Summer Reliability Generation and to provide energy to
the DWR.  Should we produce these documents?
*	Enron Business Plans.  These documents talk in general terms about
strategies for developing revenue in California - not necessarily forecasts
of revenue.  These documents fall on the fringe of what has been asked for
by the subpoena.  Siting/ Generation Development documents.  This is a broad
category of documents which are irrelevant to the Senate investigation.
However, if the subpoena is broadly (and perhaps fairly) read, many
documents within this category may be responsive.  Our suggestion is to
carve out these documents, and let the Senate Committee know that we are
doing so.  For example:
		.Dunn asks for information about generation units owned or
controlled by Enron.  We found documents in which Enron "controlled" the
development of the unit, but then sold it to a third party.  Likewise, Enron
is involved in a project to expand Las Vegas Co-Gen facility.
		.Many of these documents contain financial data, such as
supply and demand curves and pricing data in order to analyze whether to go
forward with the project.
		.We have numerous proposal and drafts, but not finalized
deals, in which negotiated to act as scheduling coordinators or to buy the
energy from the facility.  These drafts are not called for by the subpoena,
but documents related to final contracts are.
		.We have gathered documents related to negotiations with QFs
to serve as Scheduling Coordinators, which apparently coincide with
divestiture by the utilities.
*	Documents related to meetings of the Independent Energy Producers
("IEP") trade association.  These documents clearly are responsive.  Many,
however, contain sensitive and privilege information, including information
about lobbying efforts.  Thus, we need to provide notice to the IEP that we
are required to produce these documents and give them an opportunity to
review these documents before we produce them.  Additionally, we should
contact their counsel to see what, if anything, has already been produced (I
assume that they have been subpoenaed).
*	B.	Enron Corp Documents in San Francisco yet to be Reviewed
We have almost completed our review of potentially responsive materials
maintained in the San Francisco office.  We will complete this review next
week, and produce any additional documents to the repository.  The following
is a list of the remaining materials to be reviewed:
*	Electronic documents on Sue Mara's hard drive
*	Email messages maintained by Dave Parquet, Mike McDonald, and Sue
Mara
*	Interview Mike McDonald
*	Review addition materials relating to QF's recently located by
Enron.
*	C. Logistical Issues and Questions for Mike Kirby
*	Delivering boxes to Sacramento repository
We need someone to drive the boxes to Sacramento and obtain a key for the
repository space.  Bob Webb, a senior paralegal, has "volunteered" if we
need him to go.
*	Staffing the Sacramento repository
 We assume that we will need a proctor when the Senate Committee reviews the
documents.   Can we work out a schedule or protocol with them?  Moreover, we
will need to have someone drive to Sacramento each time we produce
documents.  We cannot simply federal express or messenger the documents
because there is no one to receive them.
*	Confidential Stamping
We have not marked anything "Confidential."  Should we do that now, or
should we wait until the Senate selects documents for copying?
*	Privilege Log
We will begin creating a privilege log next week.  When do we need to have
it completed?

This briefly reports on the status of the production of in-state Enron
documents to the depository in Sacramento:

. Approximately 30,000 documents are now in the Sacramento depository. All
are bate stamped. These documents are primarily ISO related documents and
appear not to raise serious confidentiality concerns. We notified ISO we
were going to produce these documents and they were reviewed for privilege
by  outside counsel for ISO. She requested we withhold certain documents for
privilege and we did so at her request. We will mark these on a privilege
log and direct Dunn to ISO counsel if he wishes to contest the claim of
privilege.  Dunne's representatives have not reviewed any of the documents
in Sacramento to date.  We propose to staff the depository upon  reasonable
notice from the Committee that they wish to review documents. We should send
them a letter that says we require such notice.
.There are approximately another 20,000 documents at our firm that are
potentially responsive to the subpoena. Many of these documents do appear to
raised confidentiality issues. We have sent examples of these documents to
many of you and await your comments before we ready them for production. We
will not produce them in Sacramento without further discussion on the issue.
Included in these 20,000 documents are documents from the IEP trade
association. We need to speak to the attorney's representing the IEP before
production.
.We have not completed a privilege review of unproduced hard copy documents
in San Francisco, nor completed a privilege log, pending further discussion
on this issue with Mike Kirby.
. We believe we have identified most potentially responsive hard copy
documents in Enron's San Francisco office. However, we have  reviewed very
few electronic documents, including e-mail. We propose to do so next week
for the following individuals only: Dave Parquet, Sue Mara, and Mike
McDonald. We will need clearance from Richard to enable us to do so
effectively.

	We are continuing to identify and review potentially responsive
documents within California called for by the subpoena issued by Dunn's
Committee to Enron Corp and by the California AG's subpoenas to Enron Energy
Services. Peter Meringolo and Amanda Smith are leading this effort at our
office. This is our report on the status of this document identification and
our plans, subject to your direction,  to continue this effort next week.
The last section of the memo poses certain logistical questions and issues
regarding the production to  Dunn's Committee that Mike Kirby should
address as soon as possible.
I. Status of EES' Response to Subpoena from AG
As we previously reported, we have completed a preliminary investigation of
documents in the EES's offices in California which are responsive to the
subpoena from the attorney general.  Below is a report of (1) documents
collected (2) documents we need to collect soon; and (3) action items which
we still need to do in order to identify responsive documents.
		A.	Documents Collected
We have copies of the following documents:
*	Contracts from the San Ramon office
*	Contracts and documents relating to the contracts from Costa Mesa
office
		B.	Documents to Collect
We previously identified the following relevant documents.  However, we have
not yet collected them into one central location:
*	Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities.
These documents are on Mojgan Ahad's hard drive in files labeled "California
Rapid Response" and "California Strike Force" and email.
*	"Golden Bear" documents in San Ramon, Costa Mesa and Long Beach
*	Files related to status of EDI's (re: return of customers to PG&E).
Presently kept by Summer Intern, Kerri Bernstein.
*	Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities.
These documents are on Mojgan Ahad's hard drive in files labeled "California
Rapid Response" and "California Strike Force" and email.
*	"Golden Bear" documents in San Ramon, Costa Mesa and Long Beach
*	Files related to status of EDI's (re: return of customers to PG&E).
Presently kept by Summer Intern, Kerri Bernstein.
*	Documents "related to" each contract in the possession of each
account manager in San Ramon
*	Current and Old Organization charts
		C.	Action Items
To complete our review of the relevant documents in California, we plan to
do the following:
*	Review emails and hard drives of Tom Riley, Dirk van Ulden, Mojgan
Ahad, and Jim Wright
*	Interview, and review documents in the possession of, "Originators"
in Long Beach


II. Status of Enron Corporation's Response to Subpoena from Senator Dunn
We are prepared to produce more than 30,000 pages of documents to the
Sacramento repository on Monday in response to the subpoena from Senator
Dunn.  This memorandum sets forth the remaining issues to be resolved before
Enron's production of documents in California is complete.
This memorandum is divided into three sections:  (1) substantive issues to
be resolved; (2) documents remaining to be reviewed, and (3) logistical
issues to be addressed by Mike Kirby.
		A.	Substantive Issues
We have prepared and sent to Mike Kirby and Richard Sanders and others a
packet of documents which we need to discuss as soon as possible.  We need
guidance about whether we ought to produce these types of documents.  These
documents include:
*	Bids made to DWR & ISO.  The subpoena calls for bids made to the ISO
and PX, and we assume that this means "bid data."  However, Enron did submit
bids to provide for Summer Reliability Generation and to provide energy to
the DWR.  Should we produce these documents?
*	Enron Business Plans.  These documents talk in general terms about
strategies for developing revenue in California - not necessarily forecasts
of revenue.  These documents fall on the fringe of what has been asked for
by the subpoena.  Siting/ Generation Development documents.  This is a broad
category of documents which are irrelevant to the Senate investigation.
However, if the subpoena is broadly (and perhaps fairly) read, many
documents within this category may be responsive.  Our suggestion is to
carve out these documents, and let the Senate Committee know that we are
doing so.  For example:
		.Dunn asks for information about generation units owned or
controlled by Enron.  We found documents in which Enron "controlled" the
development of the unit, but then sold it to a third party.  Likewise, Enron
is involved in a project to expand Las Vegas Co-Gen facility.
		.Many of these documents contain financial data, such as
supply and demand curves and pricing data in order to analyze whether to go
forward with the project.
		.We have numerous proposal and drafts, but not finalized
deals, in which negotiated to act as scheduling coordinators or to buy the
energy from the facility.  These drafts are not called for by the subpoena,
but documents related to final contracts are.
		.We have gathered documents related to negotiations with QFs
to serve as Scheduling Coordinators, which apparently coincide with
divestiture by the utilities.
*	Documents related to meetings of the Independent Energy Producers
("IEP") trade association.  These documents clearly are responsive.  Many,
however, contain sensitive and privilege information, including information
about lobbying efforts.  Thus, we need to provide notice to the IEP that we
are required to produce these documents and give them an opportunity to
review these documents before we produce them.  Additionally, we should
contact their counsel to see what, if anything, has already been produced (I
assume that they have been subpoenaed).
*	B.	Enron Corp Documents in San Francisco yet to be Reviewed
We have almost completed our review of potentially responsive materials
maintained in the San Francisco office.  We will complete this review next
week, and produce any additional documents to the repository.  The following
is a list of the remaining materials to be reviewed:
*	Electronic documents on Sue Mara's hard drive
*	Email messages maintained by Dave Parquet, Mike McDonald, and Sue
Mara
*	Interview Mike McDonald
*	Review addition materials relating to QF's recently located by
Enron.
*	C. Logistical Issues and Questions for Mike Kirby
*	Delivering boxes to Sacramento repository
We need someone to drive the boxes to Sacramento and obtain a key for the
repository space.  Bob Webb, a senior paralegal, has "volunteered" if we
need him to go.
*	Staffing the Sacramento repository
 We assume that we will need a proctor when the Senate Committee reviews the
documents.   Can we work out a schedule or protocol with them?  Moreover, we
will need to have someone drive to Sacramento each time we produce
documents.  We cannot simply federal express or messenger the documents
because there is no one to receive them.
*	Confidential Stamping
We have not marked anything "Confidential."  Should we do that now, or
should we wait until the Senate selects documents for copying?
*	Privilege Log
We will begin creating a privilege log next week.  When do we need to have
it completed?

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the
preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will
allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY
FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Tim Belden

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when
hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1.   The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2.   What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3.   The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for
failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4.   Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this
policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

	Attached are two documents which summarize the status of our review
of documents at Enron's San Francisco offices. Based on interviews with
Enron officers and employees we identified about 50 boxes documents for
review. About thirty of these boxes have potentially relevant documents. The
first memorandum categorizes the potentially responsive documents by the
each specific request made by the Dunn subpoena. The second memorandum
describes the location and contents of each of the fifty boxes we selected
for review.
	We now need to review these potentially relevant documents for
privilege and confidential information.We estimate about ten boxes of
responsive, non-privileged documents will result from the review of these
files. Many of these documents will also be responsive to the subpoena
served by the California AG on Enron on June 21.  We recommend that we copy
these thirty or so boxes of documents, move the copies to our San Francisco
office for further review, selection for production, and bates stamping.
Pending your approval we plan to begin doing so Thursday morning.
	The following issues need prompt attention:

	.Michael McDonald: He is on vacation until June 11 and we have not
been able to reach him. He is said to have wholesale power sales and
financial information on his hard drive, which we cannot now access. Someone
needs to reach him.
	.Review of electronic files: We have not reviewed electronic files
in California. McDonald and Parquet are the only Enron North America Vice
Presidents in the San Francisco office and we should review their files
before the end of the week. To do any more electronic review of individual
hard drives will consume a great deal of time.
	.Intranet files: There are numerous responsive files on the Enron
intranet which are routinely and easily accessed and manipulated
by the San Francisco office. We have not reviewed these intranet files, but
the ease by which these files can be accessed in California could pose a
problem with regard to our arguments regarding the territorial limits of.
the subpoena.
	. Confidentiality concerns: We copied examples of documents which
are described as sensitive or confidential by Enron officers in San
Francisco. We will send these examples to Bob, Richard, and Mike Kirby for
their comment on Thursday.
	. Duty to notify third parties: Some of the responsive documents
require Enron to notify third parties if the documents are to be released to
others. If we plan to release these documents on June 10,  we need to give
notice soon, probably by Friday. There are a great number of EES contracts
and documents related to EES's contracts with its customers, which are
requested by both Dunn and the AG. Most of these contracts have
confidentiality clauses which require EES to either notify the customers or
fight the production of the contract. We should decide soon if we plan to
produce these documents on June 10 and what notice we must give EES
customers.

Subject:	Meetings with EES Employees in Houston: Benevides, Whalon, Bresna n, Lewis


Here is my report, attached as a word document, on my recent meetings with
EES employees, Jubran Whalon, Neil Bresnan, Dennis Benevides, Jay Lewis, and
Scott Stoness in Houston. A  description of their account of the documents
in Houston which appear to be called for by the AG's subpena to EES follows
in the text of this e-mail:

 Discussion of Specific Document Requests

No 1.  All contracts for retail sale:  These are both in California and
Houston.
Nos. 2 and 3:  All contracts under which EES has purchased electricity on
the western interconnection between 1998 and the end of 2003:  About five
percent of these contracts are for green power made with various entities.
The vast majority, approximately 95%, are contracts with EPMI, which
purchased all electricity load for EES.  There may be also a few contracts
with APX.  EES has paper fax copies of all these deals.  Their understanding
is that EPMI charged EES exactly what the utilities would have paid on the
California market.  While they do not know how EPMI actually provided for
the power, they believe EPMI probably did not buy most of it on the
California market.  They believe all these contracts are voidable if they
are revealed to any third party.  They characterize all this information as
extremely sensitive.  They believe with this information, if given enough
time and a few other variables, parties could construct Enron's price
curves.
No. 4.  Documents which identify the purchases of EES for power in the day
ahead, hour ahead, or real time markets operated by the PX or Cal ISO:  They
say there are none.  EES was a scheduling coordinator, but never used the
function.
No. 5.  Documents relating to portfolio of energy supply sources relied upon
EES to meet contractual obligations to NU's customers in California:  There
are no such documents.
No. 6.  Documents relating to the assessment of risks regarding:  the cost
of purchasing electricity in California:  They do not believe there are such
documents, but there may be presentations on this issue.
No. 7.  Documents relating to strategies or business plans designed to
minimize risks with regard to the cost of purchasing electricity necessary
to serve customers:  All EES officers and traders receive daily reports to
corporate goals for EES and show how EES was performing in conformity with
these goals.  They characterized these documents as extremely sensitive.
They use these on a daily basis.  Most of these goals are based upon the
price curves.  They also receive month end reports which show how each
division is doing according to these corporate goals.  They believe that a
corporate function called Risk Control would have custody of these reports.
Vladimir Gorny (sp?) was said to be the person in charge of these.
No. 8.  Documents relating to decisions to return direct access customers to
default utility distributors in California, including documents relating to
cost savings:  They believe these documents exist in Houston.  They believe
there are spreadsheets which show the cost savings or revenue enhancements
that EES would have received as a result of returning customers to
utilities.  They believe Don Black would have these.  They believe all these
documents would reveal price curves.
No. 9.  Communications relating to the return of direct access customers in
California:  There may be spreadsheets which exist on this subject:  They
believe that Don Black would have them.
No. 10.  Documents sufficient to identify persons most knowledgeable about
decisions made to return direct access customers in California:  These would
be the same documents as No. 9.
No. 11.  Documents related to the assessment of the dramatic increases in
electricity in California:  They don't know if these documents exist or not.
There may be some presentations on the subject.
No. 12.  All documents relating to strategy and business plans designed to
maximize revenues from the sale of electricity in California:  They construe
this request to refer to origination documents.  These would be with the
person that was in charge of selling services in California during the
period in question.  They believe Doug Condon (sp?) or Harold Buchanan would
have these documents.
No. 13.  Documents that show sales to California Department of Water
Resources:  They don't believe there are such documents.
Nos. 14, 15.  Contracts obligating them to either supply or purchase
electricity which they prematurely terminated:  They don't believe there are
any contracts which they prematurely terminated.  Some contracts were
terminated but by agreement.  The only possible exception may be the
University of California contract.
No. 16.  Organizational charts which show the persons with authority for
risk management.  They believe Dave Delaney or Marty Sunde, Vice Chairman of
EES, might have such charts.
No. 17.  Documents relating to risk management of trading activities on
California markets for electricity or natural gas and pipeline capacity:
These again may be guidelines which Delaney or Sunde might have.
No. 18.  Organizational charts regarding those who have responsibility for
approving charters and objectives for making risk management decisions:
They believe Jess Hewitt's department might have these.  They believe these
refer to risk management procedures to prevent conflict of interest among
EES traders.
No. 19.  Documents relating to development approval of charters and
objectives for making risk management decisions:  They believe there is a
master agreement on this subject.  They believe Rick Byers (sp?) might have
this agreement.  They also believe this request refers to guidelines
regarding conflict of interest for traders under their risk management
policies.
Nos. 20, 21.  Documents which identify financial and ownership positions of
natural gas or capacity to deliver and transport natural gas to California:
Gas contracts are handled by a different department at EES.  They believe
that some of these gas contracts were purchased by EPMI, but had no direct
knowledge of them.  They believe EES may have purchased its own gas or
pipeline capacity because EES has the necessary credit to accomplish this.
EES had its own power desk that scheduled gas.  However, they probably
purchased most of it from Enron North America.

The response of Enron Corp to the subpoena served on June 20 by the
California AG is due this Thursday, July 19, 2001. We propose to respond in
a manner which is similar to the response served on behalf of EES last
month. Here for your review is a draft letter response with formal
objections.

Just got this. She is taking a harder line that Sen Dunn did yesterday. I'll wait to hear from them on the nonwaiver agreement. I'll find out what happened at today's meeting of the generators and Sen Dunn

Mike,

Attached are the Select Committee's Confidentiality Agreement and Document
Depository Protocol.  As Senator Dunn reiterated a number of times during
the hearing and meeting with you, the three conditions for compliance are
that Enron sign the attached confidentiality agreement, sign the attached
document depository protocol and deposit into the depository documents
responsive to the Select Committee's priority list of 16 document
categories.  These 3 conditions remain the same.  The Select Committee does
not agree to enter into a "protective order."  The attached confidentiality
agreement is intended to be just that and not "an outline for a proposed
protective order."

The Senator and Larry Drivon will review your proposed nonwaiver agreement
and get back to you on that after they have had a chance to do so.

Should you wish to discuss this further, please feel free to call Larry
Drivon at (916) 445-5831.

Alexandra
(916) 445-5831

Here is my report, attached as a word document, on my recent meetings with
EES employees, Jubran Whalon, Neil Bresnan, Dennis Benevides, Jay Lewis, and
Scott Stoness in Houston. A  description of their account of the documents
in Houston which appear to be called for by the AG's subpena to EES follows
in the text of this e-mail:

 Discussion of Specific Document Requests

No 1.  All contracts for retail sale:  These are both in California and
Houston.
Nos. 2 and 3:  All contracts under which EES has purchased electricity on
the western interconnection between 1998 and the end of 2003:  About five
percent of these contracts are for green power made with various entities.
The vast majority, approximately 95%, are contracts with EPMI, which
purchased all electricity load for EES.  There may be also a few contracts
with APX.  EES has paper fax copies of all these deals.  Their understanding
is that EPMI charged EES exactly what the utilities would have paid on the
California market.  While they do not know how EPMI actually provided for
the power, they believe EPMI probably did not buy most of it on the
California market.  They believe all these contracts are voidable if they
are revealed to any third party.  They characterize all this information as
extremely sensitive.  They believe with this information, if given enough
time and a few other variables, parties could construct Enron's price
curves.
No. 4.  Documents which identify the purchases of EES for power in the day
ahead, hour ahead, or real time markets operated by the PX or Cal ISO:  They
say there are none.  EES was a scheduling coordinator, but never used the
function.
No. 5.  Documents relating to portfolio of energy supply sources relied upon
EES to meet contractual obligations to NU's customers in California:  There
are no such documents.
No. 6.  Documents relating to the assessment of risks regarding:  the cost
of purchasing electricity in California:  They do not believe there are such
documents, but there may be presentations on this issue.
No. 7.  Documents relating to strategies or business plans designed to
minimize risks with regard to the cost of purchasing electricity necessary
to serve customers:  All EES officers and traders receive daily reports to
corporate goals for EES and show how EES was performing in conformity with
these goals.  They characterized these documents as extremely sensitive.
They use these on a daily basis.  Most of these goals are based upon the
price curves.  They also receive month end reports which show how each
division is doing according to these corporate goals.  They believe that a
corporate function called Risk Control would have custody of these reports.
Vladimir Gorny (sp?) was said to be the person in charge of these.
No. 8.  Documents relating to decisions to return direct access customers to
default utility distributors in California, including documents relating to
cost savings:  They believe these documents exist in Houston.  They believe
there are spreadsheets which show the cost savings or revenue enhancements
that EES would have received as a result of returning customers to
utilities.  They believe Don Black would have these.  They believe all these
documents would reveal price curves.
No. 9.  Communications relating to the return of direct access customers in
California:  There may be spreadsheets which exist on this subject:  They
believe that Don Black would have them.
No. 10.  Documents sufficient to identify persons most knowledgeable about
decisions made to return direct access customers in California:  These would
be the same documents as No. 9.
No. 11.  Documents related to the assessment of the dramatic increases in
electricity in California:  They don't know if these documents exist or not.
There may be some presentations on the subject.
No. 12.  All documents relating to strategy and business plans designed to
maximize revenues from the sale of electricity in California:  They construe
this request to refer to origination documents.  These would be with the
person that was in charge of selling services in California during the
period in question.  They believe Doug Condon (sp?) or Harold Buchanan would
have these documents.
No. 13.  Documents that show sales to California Department of Water
Resources:  They don't believe there are such documents.
Nos. 14, 15.  Contracts obligating them to either supply or purchase
electricity which they prematurely terminated:  They don't believe there are
any contracts which they prematurely terminated.  Some contracts were
terminated but by agreement.  The only possible exception may be the
University of California contract.
No. 16.  Organizational charts which show the persons with authority for
risk management.  They believe Dave Delaney or Marty Sunde, Vice Chairman of
EES, might have such charts.
No. 17.  Documents relating to risk management of trading activities on
California markets for electricity or natural gas and pipeline capacity:
These again may be guidelines which Delaney or Sunde might have.
No. 18.  Organizational charts regarding those who have responsibility for
approving charters and objectives for making risk management decisions:
They believe Jess Hewitt's department might have these.  They believe these
refer to risk management procedures to prevent conflict of interest among
EES traders.
No. 19.  Documents relating to development approval of charters and
objectives for making risk management decisions:  They believe there is a
master agreement on this subject.  They believe Rick Byers (sp?) might have
this agreement.  They also believe this request refers to guidelines
regarding conflict of interest for traders under their risk management
policies.
Nos. 20, 21.  Documents which identify financial and ownership positions of
natural gas or capacity to deliver and transport natural gas to California:
Gas contracts are handled by a different department at EES.  They believe
that some of these gas contracts were purchased by EPMI, but had no direct
knowledge of them.  They believe EES may have purchased its own gas or
pipeline capacity because EES has the necessary credit to accomplish this.
EES had its own power desk that scheduled gas.  However, they probably
purchased most of it from Enron North America.

> California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  Nevertheless,
> Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction

> Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19
>
>  We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for

This memorandum further analyzes the ability of Enron and EES to remove to
federal court a California state court proceeding to enforce a subpoena for
documents and testimony. It specifically addresses the arguments raised by
the briefs filed by the  Reliant, Mirant and the California Attorney General
in April and May, 2001 in litigation relating to a similar enforcement
proceeding in Reliant Energy Power Generation, Inc., et al. v. Lockyer,
California Superior Court, Los Angeles County, Case No. BC 248689.
In light of the Reliant case, if EES removes an enforcement proceeding to
federal court the AG will probably argue that the petition for removal is
not a "civil action" because a petition to enforce the subpoena is a
"special proceeding" and not an "action."  We also anticipate that the AG
will argue that there is no federal question because the Government Code
sections provide an exclusive statutory scheme which provides jurisdiction
only to the California superior court.
These arguments do not change our previous analysis, but highlight the our
conclusion:  assuming the existence of a federal question in the AG's
enforcement petition, EES can file a petition for removal, but its burden to
prevail on a motion for remand will be difficult to meet.
I.	SUMMARY OF RELIANT ET AL. V. LOCKYER
In early 2001 Lockyer served subpoenas for documents on Reliant and Mirant
under Government Code sections 11180, et seq.  Reliant and Mirant did not
dispute the AG's ability to seek this information, and voluntarily produced
non-confidential information.  However, Reliant and Mirant disputed the AG's
ability to disclose confidential information without a protective order.
Several days before the AG, as a petitioner, filed an enforcement action in
San Francisco Superior Court to compel Reliant and Mirant to produce
documents,  Reliant and Mirant affirmatively filed a complaint as plaintiffs
for declaratory relief and an injunction in the Los Angeles Superior Court.

The AG filed a motion to dismiss the Reliant action primarily on the grounds
that the Government Code establishes the exclusive procedure for enforcement
of this subpoena (i.e., the AG's filing of a petition to enforce the
subpoena), the Government Code does not allow for the filing of injunctive
relief, and granting an injunction would violate the separation of powers
and circumvent the special proceedings of the Government Code.
On May 11, 2001 the Court denied the AG's demurrer. The AG then agreed to a
compromise interim protective order and Mirant and Reliant produced
requested documents while reserving  rights to continue the litigation.
II.	CASE OR CONTROVERSY UNDER ARTICLE III
As an initial matter, we considered whether an enforcement proceeding
constitutes a "case or controversy" under Article III of the United States
Constitution.  We conclude it probably does.
The power of federal courts is constitutionally limited to cases and
controversies.  See Flast v. Cohen (1968) 392 U.S. 83, 94.  This doctrine
limits the courts "to questions presented in an adversary context and in a
form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial
process."  Id. at 95.  Furthermore, Article III is intended to "define the
role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power to assure
that the federal courts will not intrude into areas committed to the other
branches of government."  Id.  Applications of this doctrine include a
finding of no justiciable controversy "when the parties seek adjudication of
only political questions, when the parties are asking for only advisory
opinions, when the question sought to be adjudicated has been mooted by
subsequent developments, and where there is no standing to maintain the
action."  Id.
This  is not the issue here.  Upon the filing of a petition, the AG will
probably not dispute that there is a controversy.  The AG has conceded that
"as a matter of law, there is no actual controversy in an investigatory
proceeding until the Attorney General moves to enforce the subpoena."  AG
Reply at 9.  We found no cases where removal of a similar petition was
denied on the ground that it did not prevent a case or controversy under
Article III.
III.	REMOVAL OF PETITION
As discussed in our previous memorandum, removal jurisdiction is conferred
by federal statute.  See 28 U.S.C. ? 1441(a).  This statute provides in
relevant part that:
		Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress,
any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of
the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the
defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for
the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.
As we previously concluded, in order for EES to remove any enforcement
action filed by the AG, EES must show that (1) the petition is a "civil
action" under the removal statute and (2) the AG's investigation, which
underlies the subpoena enforcement action, is preempted by federal law, thus
making removal proper on the basis of federal question removal jurisdiction.

The AG likely will argue that (1) that the petition to enforce the subpoena
is not a "civil action" but rather is a special proceeding and (2) that the
petition does not present a federal question because it is undertaking an
enforcement procedure created by California statutory which grants exclusive
jurisdiction to California courts.  These arguments are analyzed below.
	A.  AG's Argument That Petition is Not an "Action"
First, EES must show that a petition by the AG to enforce a subpoena is a
"civil action."  Under federal law, the definition of "civil action" is
extremely broad and appears to cover everything except criminal proceedings.
In our previous memorandum, we concluded that EES has a good faith argument
that a petition is a "civil action" for the purposes of removal.  In
Reliant, et al. v. Lockyer, filed in the Superior Court, County of Los
Angeles, the AG argued that petitions under the Government Code are "special
proceedings" not "civil actions."  The AG's arguments do not change our
previous conclusions.
The AG's arguments are founded solely upon language in See People ex rel
Franchise Tax Board v. Superior Court (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 526.  In that
case, the court of appeals stated that:
				the hearing under section 11188 is a special
proceeding.  In practice the term 'special proceeding' is used in
contradistinction to 'action;' it refers only to proceedings which were not,
under the common law or equity practice, either an action at law or a suit
in equity.  They are proceedings which may be commenced independently of a
pending action, by petition or motion upon notice, in order to obtain
special relief.

Id. at 538.
Despite the AG's arguments, Franchise Tax Board has no weight in determining
whether the petition is a "civil action" under the federal removal statute.
Federal law determines whether there is an action is a "civil action."  See,
e.g., In re Exhumation of Meriwether Lewis (N.D. Tenn. 1998) 999 F.Supp.
1066.  Without a doubt, the term "civil action," has been "construed broadly
by the federal courts."  Wright & Miller, 14B Fed. Practice and Proc.,
Juris. 3d ? 3721 (West 1998).  According to Wright & Miller:
			The limitation to civil actions is not particularly
important, however, since the term 'civil action' has been construed broadly
by the federal courts.  For example, proceedings for garnishment or
condemnation and actions to compel arbitration or to confirm or vacate an
arbitration award are considered civil actions within the meaning of the
federal removal statute.  Moreover, special federal statutes permit the
removal of certain non-civil proceedings.  In effect therefore, the
limitation to civil actions in Section 1441 may mean no more than that state
court criminal, and perhaps penalty, actions are not removable except as
otherwise provided by a specific federal statute.
Applying a broad definition of "civil action," courts have held that
petitions to exhume a body, petition to enforce administrative subpoenas,
garnishment actions, actions to compel arbitration and contempt proceedings
are "civil actions" within the scope of Section 1441.  See, e.g., Agosto v.
Barcelo (D. P. R. 1984) 594 F. Supp. 1390, 1392 (enforcement of
administrative subpoena), overruled on other grounds, (1st Cir. 1984) 748
F.2d 1; Lewis v. Blackmon (S. D. Miss. 1994) 864 F. Supp. 1 (garnishment
action); Sears Roebuck and Co. v. Glenwal Co. (S.D.N.Y. 1970) 325 F. Supp.
86 (action to compel arbitration); Reynolds Metals Co. v. Crowther, (D. Mass
1982) 572 F. Supp 288, 289 (contempt proceeding); In re Exhumation of
Meriwether Lewis, 999 F. Supp 1066 (1998) (petition to exhume body).
Moreover, the cases relied upon by the AG support the notion that the
proceedings to enforce the subpoena are akin to an action.   See People ex
rel Franchise Tax Board v. Superior Court(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 526 (in
hearing on petition under the Government Code, court "may judicially test
whether the subpoena duces tecum conforms to the requisite legal and
constitutional standards"); Fielder v. Berkeley Properties Co. (1972) 23
Cal.App.3d 30 (hearing on petition to enforce a subpoena "provides an
opportunity for adjudication of all claimed constitutional and legal rights
before one is required to obey the subpoena").
The AG also relies on Triple A Machine Shop Inc. v. California (1989) 213
Cal.App.3d 131.  This case is inapplicable.  Triple A has nothing to do with
the application of the Government Code at issue or the enforcement of
subpoenas under the Government Code.  Rather, Triple A analyzed the
propriety of enjoining criminal investigations.  In that case, the San
Francisco District Attorney and the State Department of Health commenced a
criminal and civil investigation into violations of law governing the
storage and disposal of hazardous waste.  The district attorney obtained a
search warrant.  The district attorney also brought a suit to enjoin
defendants from dissipating any assets.  Defendant filed an action for
injunctive relief to enjoin the state from contacting high level managerial
employees in violation of attorney client privilege and in violation of
their ethical duties.  The injunction was issued.  The court of appeals
reversed, holding that there was no threat of misconduct by the district
attorney or violations of the attorney client privilege.  The court further
stated that:
				The most significant effect of the
injunction lies in its impact on the investigation and prosecution of the
criminal charges.  The separation of powers doctrine requires judicial
restraint in enjoining criminal investigations or prosecutions. . . .  The
discretionary authority vested in the district attorney to investigate and
prosecute criminal conduct is considered too vital to the interest of public
order to be subjected to prior restraint by the courts except under
extraordinary circumstances.

Id. at 145 (emphasis added).
EES is not asking the court to enjoin the AG's investigation.  EES is merely
invoking the jurisdiction of the federal court pursuant to the federal
removal statutes in order to litigate the legal and constitutional issues
related to the AG's subpoena.  Thus, Triple A is inapposite.
	B.	The Petition Must Present a Federal Question
Second, EES must also argue that a federal question appears on the face of
plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint or that plaintiff's artfully pleaded
complaint involves a federal question.  As in the currently pending civil
lawsuits, EES will argue that the AG's investigation (or some of it) is
completely preempted by the Federal Power Act which governs wholesale energy
prices and thus presents a federal question.  Without a doubt, this presents
the biggest obstacle to successful removal, especially since EES cannot
inject a federal question sufficient to justify removal by way of defense.
This burden may be somewhat easier for Enron or Enron Wholesale services to
meet, since neither company does business on the retail level in California,
as EES does. However, as discussed in our previous memorandum, both EES and
Enron  must contend with contrary Ninth Circuit precedent.  See Lewis v.
Younger (9th Cir. 1980) 653 F.2d 1258.  In addition, the AG will argue, that
the petition does not present a federal question but is merely seeking to
enforce a subpoena under the provisions of the Government Code, which
provides the exclusive means for adjudicating any dispute relating to an
investigatory subpoena.  We will better know whether we have a reasonable
chance to prevail on this issue when Judge Whaley rules on the currently
pending remand motions.
