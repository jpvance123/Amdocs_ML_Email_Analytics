For all of you who are active participants in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, we have made arrangements with Northern Trust, our Plan Administrator, to expedite any loan requests made during the week of June 18 - June 29 in order to help you during this recovery period from any flood damage you may have experienced.

If you do not already have an outstanding loan, you can request up to 50% of your balance up to a maximum of $50,000.  To request a loan follow these three easy steps in order to ensure quick processing:

	1. Log onto the website:   https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/# or call the Benefits Service Center at 713.853.7979.

	2. Enter your SSN and your Personal Identification Number and click on "Loan Information" to see the amount available.
	If you wish to request a loan, click on "Loan Modeling/Request" and follow the instructions.

	3. Checks will be mailed from Northern Trust in Chicago  on June 27 for loans requested the week of June 18 - June 22 	and on July 5 for loans requested	June 25 - June 29. 

NOTE:  The IRS restricts Hardship Withdrawals to specific circumstances outlined in the Money-in-Motion guide on the benefits website.  Unfortunately, while we know the flood has imposed hardships on many of you, these circumstances do not qualify for a withdrawal.

Please read the e-mail below. Let's take advantage of the many politicians etc. trying to grab some attention from our terrible situation. We need our severance packages of some sort.
It cannot hurt to log on and get some attention to our plight......severance. It takes about 2 minutes tops and automatically faxes for you!

Dear Michelle Foust, 

You and other e-Activists helped bring laid-off Enron
workers closer to justice this week. On Feb. 27, a
bankruptcy court judge ordered Enron to create a fund
for laid-off workers' emergency expenses and told creditors
to negotiate a fair severance settlement. 

After you and other e-Activists sent thousands of faxes
to Enron and its creditors, the bankruptcy court asked
for three things. First, Enron should provide immediately
a $5 million fund to pay emergency expenses for laid-off
workers. Second, Enron and its corporate creditors--including
CitiGroup, J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and the Bank
of New York--must negotiate with laid-off Enron workers
to reach a fair severance settlement. The workers,
Enron and the corporate creditors must report back
to the bankruptcy judge on the progress of their talks
by Tuesday, March 5. 

Those workers walked into bankruptcy court with the
support of e-Activists like you--but now they need
your help again. Please take one minute to send a new
fax with a new message to Enron and its corporate creditors.
Negotiations are going on today. Click on the link
below now to take action: 
http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/enronworkers2/xbsxeavbbn 

Then, click on the link below now to tell your friends,
family and co-workers to send a message to Enron's
creditors urging them to agree to a fair severance
package with Enron workers.

Hey nan- Did you happen to notice this little blurb.......how is it that people who were there hardly any length of time and weren't making much to begin with should be given more consideration than us? A lot of people would have only had a couple months on the typical plan. And if they think people who were making more money are in less hardship, they obviously have never seen the bills our friends have.

LMF

Income Cap
18. The Former Employees recognize that the hardships faced by the laid-off workers are greatest at lower end of the income spectrum and not as overwhelming higher up.  Accordingly, they propose that the full severance payments (including any $4500 payments) be limited to $30,000 per employee.

Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.  The company code is 179E.

The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.  

With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:
 
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.  No changes here.
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.  For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.  These "5" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.  You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).  
If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.  During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.
If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.  Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate "5" series cost center on company 179E.  

If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003.

Hi Kevin:  My sister, Michelle Otteman, suggested I forward my resume' to you for Enron's consideration.  As you can tell from the document my primary interest/background is Finance; however, in keeping with Enron's reputation for innovation, I am "open".
 
I appreciate your help.  Recently the temp in Michigan has been in the 90's; I think I could get used to Houston.
Thanks again,
Gene

<P>Kevin,</P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your patience in this matter. We always make sure to email you the best price on the right car. Unfortunately in the past we have been guilty of quick quotes, and the price was given immediately. However we found it isn't very helpful to quote our customers on the wrong car. That's why we just want to make sure you get the right price, so you can come buy the car without the hassle and avoid any confusion. 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I let you know earlier. We have a pricing philosophy in place to save you money and time. Depending on the vehicle you choose when you arrive on the lot our pricing is between 1% to 9% over wholesale. On a vehicle like the one you elected a 2001 Toyota Tundra AccessCab V8 4x4, you can purchase for 1% over wholesale. That number is $25,986.44 (including $2000 rebate good till 10/01/01) plus any tax, title and licensing fees. This includes the following options:</P><FONT color=#000000>

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

*****  Attention Remote Access Users - Important Update  *****

There is now an interim solution in place for your remote access needs.

Please use 713-440-4221 or 866-295-3813 for dial-up access.

Windows 2000:

VPN access for Windows 2000 is fully operational.  Either the VPN without iPass option can be used, or a connection may be created manually using the same settings as VPN without iPass.  For users who are dialing in, creating a Dial-Up connection using either number listed above with the default settings will work.  You must be sure to append the domain name to the user id (i.e.. CORP\rbarker) for the connection to be successful.

Windows 9x:

Dial-Up access is working provided that Dial-Up Networking version 1.4 is installed on the system.  Dial-Up Networking version 1.4 can be downloaded from http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q285189.  Follow the instructions for installation.  VPN access for Windows 9x has not yet been verified.  Dial-Up connections using either number listed above should be setup using the default settings.

Windows NT:

Dial-Up access for Windows NT4 is working provided that Service Pack 6a has been installed on the system.  Service Pack 6a may be obtained from http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/SP6/128bitX86/default.asp. Follow the instructions for installation.  VPN access for Windows NT4 has not yet been verified.  Dial-Up connections using either number listed above should be setup using the default settings.

This information is also available on the ETS Solution Center website at http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/Solution_Center/default.asp under Quick Reference - Remote Access with additional information about setting up a Dial-Up connection.

Please keep in mind that the Remote Access situation is changing rapidly.  You will be notified as additional information or updates become available.

Paula, I was not listed on your memo re RDI and I have had access since June.  Kevin Hyatt and I work together using this software and in deciding whether to get 1 or 2 accesses, we need to know the price.  Could you let me know that so I can approach our VP about this.
 
Hope all is going great for you.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Hey Lyndon--
	how's it going?  I went looking for the your Beretta Silversmith
shotgun again the other day and no one had heard of it.  Beretta does
make a Silver Hawk double-barrel side-by-side and also a Silver Pigeon
over/under shotgun, but no Silversmith.

Let's get together and have lunch soon, I may be looking to make some
career changes.

talk with you soon.

I am going to have to take our system down on Thursday, November 8th to pack it.  We may not have email for a couple of months, until we get a phone line and until I can get re-set up.  Everyone's is in Denver, only and I don't know yet if I can access the new Denver area code from ours of 303 without it being long distance.  I will email all of  you when I have email up again.

Take care.

California's new State Song! The Rolling Blackout Theme Song
(To the theme music from the TV western "Rawhide") 
Rollin', rollin', rollin',
Though the state is golden,
Keep them blackouts rollin', statewide.
A little colder weather,
And we all freeze together,
Wishin' more plants were on the line.
All the things I'm missin',
Like lights and television,
Are waiting 'til we can pay the price. 
(Chorus)
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide! 
Keep movin', movin', movin',
Though they're disapprovin',
Keep them rates a-movin', statewide.
Don't try to understand 'em,
Just raise, charge, and collect 'em.
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.
My heart's calculatin',
Nuclear plants will be waitin',
Be waitin' at the end of my ride. 
(Chorus)
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide!
STATEWIDE! Hyaah!

Dear Kevin Hyatt,

For those of you who have been comparing SEC filing services, we've been
busy in the last eight weeks adding new features most requested from our
users.

 New! Client Tracking and Reporting Option - Helpful for those who need to
monitor time and activities for re-billing.

to setup a corporate account with two or more people.

and customized access to large groups.

 New! No Advertising on 10K Wizard - no annoying banner ads to intrude on
your search activities.

*       Real time SEC Filings - No embargoes, SEC filings are posted as soon
as they are filed with the SEC.

attachments. No limits on the number of downloaded documents, no additional

Subject: This was in the Miami Times this morning




By Leonard Pitts Jr.
                         Syndicated columnist

                         They pay me to tease shades of meaning from
social and cultural issues, to provide words that help make sense
                         of that which troubles the American soul. But
in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving
                         eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the
only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author
                         of this suffering.

                         You monster. You beast. You unspeakable
#######.

                         What lesson did you hope to teach us by your
coward's attack on our World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us?
                         What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever
it was, please know that you failed.

                         Did you want us to respect your cause? You just
damned your cause.

                         Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled
our resolve.

                         Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought
us together.

                         Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast
and quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, cultural, political
                         and class division, but a family nonetheless.
We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional
                         energy on pop cultural minutiae, a singer's
revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse.

                         We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready
availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that,
                         we walk through life with a certain sense of
blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though -
                         peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to
know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming
                         majority of us, people of faith, believers in a
just and loving God.

                         Some people - you, perhaps - think that any or
all of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We are not weak.
                         Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be
measured by arsenals.

                         Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and
we are in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of the
                         awful thing you did, still working to make
ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some
                         Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot
development from a Tom Clancy novel.

                         Both in terms of the awful scope of its
ambition and the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to
go
                         down as the worst acts of terrorism in the
history of the United States and, indeed, the history of the world.
                         You've bloodied us as we have never been
bloodied before.

                         But there's a gulf of difference between making
us bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught
                         to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit
us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and
                         monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous
in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this level
                         of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay
any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice.

                         I tell you this without fear of contradiction.
I know my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me.
                         It also causes me to tremble with dread of the
future.

                         In days to come, there will be recrimination
and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed
                         this to happen and what can be done to prevent
it from happening again. There will be heightened security,
                         misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms.
We'll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But
                         determined, too. Unimaginably determined.

                         You see, there is steel beneath this velvet.
That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who
                         don't know us well. On this day, the family's
bickering is put on hold. As Americans we will weep, as Americans we
                         will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in
defense of all that we cherish.

                         Still, I keep wondering what it was you hoped
to teach us. It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to
                         know the depths of your hatred.

                         If that's the case, consider the message
received. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my
                         people. You don't know what we're about. You
don't know what you just started.

                         But you're about to learn.

Kevin,

I have spoken to Will and we are going to determine how many people are interested and whether they have a budget to support Enron's purchasing the product.  We will keep you updated.
Thanks,

Concur Expense (XMS)
Common Questions


1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document Library.   Go to the following link:
http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it cost?
Answer: Go to the following link: http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering expense reports.

6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
?	The first screen only has one tab instead of two
?	New expense types were added
?	Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
?	Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
?	The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been separated out


Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.

Changing the Order of the Tab and Group Stops by Jeffrey J. Mayer

If you?ve ever wanted to change the order in which your cursor moves from
field to field when you press the Tab or Enter keys, this tip is for you.
What you?ll want to do is change the Tab Stops or the Group Stops.

This is how you do it:
1. Select Design Layouts from the ACT! Tools menu.
2.  Select Edit, Field Entry Order, Show from the menu bar to display
 the Tab and Group Stops within the layout.

 Within each field on the layout two little gray boxes appear at the
 field's right-hand edge. The Tab Stop box has a number that
 designates its position in the Tab Stop sequence. If a field is set
 as a Group Stop, a red dot appears in the gray box just to the left
 of the numbered Tab Stop.

3.  Click the number on the fields whose tab order you want to change,
 and the number disappears.

 ACT!Tip: If you double-click either the Tab Stop number or the
 Group Stop sign, the Object Properties dialog box appears. Click
 Cancel to make it go away.

4.  Click the fields in the new order in which you want the cursor to
 move when you press the Tab key. ACT! inserts a new number.

Adding and removing Group Stops is just as simple. To add a Group Stop,
just click the Group Stop button, and the red dot appears. To remove a
Group Stop, just click the Group Stop button, and the red dot disappears.

Here are some additional things you can do with Tab and Group Stops:
* Clear your Tab and Group Stops: Select Edit, Field Entry Order,
 Clear. Then click the fields in the order in which you want the
 cursor to move when you press the Tab or Enter keys.
*  Reset your Tab and Group Stops: Select Edit, Field Entry Order,
 Reset. 
*  Hide your Tab and Group Stops: After you set your Tab and Group
 Stops, you can make them disappear by selecting Edit, Field Entry
 Order, Hide.

This tip was provided by Jeffrey Mayer, and is excerpted from his newest
ACT! eBook "Customizing Your ACT! Database". To order and download Jeff's
new ACT! & Business eBooks "Growing Your Business With ACT!", "Getting
Organized With SideACT!", "ACT! Power User Tips" and "Opening Doors with a

ACT! Fanatic User Stories

Thanks to so many of you for sharing how ACT! helps you run your day and
your business.  Here are a few stories from ACT! Fanatics that will give
you ideas to help make ACT! work even better for you.

Why I'm an ACT! Fanatic from Alex K.

?We have been a faithful ACT! user since 1997. We have been able to
customize our ACT! user fields to meet our very specific business needs. We
are able to organize all of our customers by group and easily create
specialized mailings targeting any group we have created. We also use the
scheduling feature in a network situation, so all of us are able to
schedule service calls from any one of the network stations. As a database
manager, ACT! is second to none and without a doubt has made our business
more profitable and easier to operate.?

Why I'm an ACT! Fanatic from Robert F.

?Among other things, I use ACT! for sending out faxes and e-mails to
promote concerts for the choir I am in.  Because ACT! integrates with
WinFax Pro and Word, I can create a template for the notice in Word, sort
out which media contacts I want to send the notice to in ACT!, merge the
two and have the notices sent automatically with WinFax Pro.  After the
faxes are sent, I have a report detailing the job including which faxes
were not received.  Integrating ACT! templates with Word really simplifies
a lot of my work and saves me a lot of time.

Why I'm an ACT! Fanatic from Dennis K.

ACT 2000! is my ONE STOP--it's the place where I access my database, keep
my calendar in order, handle my e-mail and faxes, track my sales efforts
... and NOW, thanks to these cool "add-ons,"  I can effectively download
data quickly via egrabber and listgrabber, send e-mails in HTML form, and,
transfer info to my Palm Pilot.?

Effective, July 1, 2001, a number of measures and recommendations were implemented to reduce costs associated with travel, entertainment and professional services throughout Enron.  As ETS employees, it is our responsibility to follow the Enron-wide cost-savings guidelines below:

Travel and Business Expenses

?	Air Travel - Reducing air transportation costs is Enron's top priority.  Please take advantage of Enron's negotiated discounted airline fares by using ClickTrip, the Enron-managed online travel booking service, located at <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>.  Although use of Travel Agency in the Park ("TAP") or the Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS)-approved preferred travel agency for your location are still available, ClickTrip is the tool we should all use.

ClickTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for their destination (excluding proprietary carriers) and assists employees in making the most cost-effective travel decisions by providing the most current information.  In addition to bringing an estimated savings of 20%, ClickTrip is easy to use and is accessible 24 hours a day from any internet-enabled personal computer.  After-hours telephone support is also available.

When making travel reservations, please purchase non-refundable coach tickets when flying in the U.S., for these tickets can cost up to 65% less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed, if necessary, for a $100 fee.

?	Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has negotiated preferred rates at a number of worldwide hotel chains, as well as with National and Alamo car rental companies.  For more detailed information, please visit <http://travel.enron.com>.

?	On-line Expense Reporting - All requests for reimbursement of business-related expenses should be made through XMS, the new on-line expense account reporting tool.  Please access XMS at <http://xms.enron.com>.

?	Off-site Meetings - To schedule off-site meetings and events for more than 10 people, please contact Tracy Ramsey, GSS Director, Travel and Transportation Services Portfolio Team at (713) 646-8311.

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 646-8311.  


Professional Services

To better leverage Enron's purchasing power, all new professional service expenditure arrangements including legal, financial, accounting, engineering, information technology and others, and those due for renewal, must be negotiated through, or in consultation with, GSS.  Contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by both GSS and ETS. Prior to engaging GSS, please submit all service requisition forms to Rod Hayslett, Danny McCarty, Phil Lowry or me for business unit approval.  

To comply with the professional service procedure, a Professional Services Requisition form must be completed.  This requisition can be accessed on-line at <http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/servicesprojectrequestform.xls>, or by contacting Ron L. Smith, GSS Director, Administrative and Indirect Services Portfolio Team at (713) 345-6329.
    
Additional information about Enron's cost-saving initiative will be on ETV, in eBiz and Enron Business, as well as in information booths in the Enron Building.

As we all work together to reduce costs across Enron, please forward additional cost-saving ideas to <recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com>.  

If you have additional questions, please contact Derryl Cleaveland, GSS Senior Director of Operations, at (713) 646-7024.

Kevin,

I found out that we are not close at this point to a corp. contract with Energy Central.  You would need to obtain a singe license user which is as follows:

Daliy Electric News	$191.00 Annually
Daily Gas News		$191.00 Annually 
For Both		$382.00 Annually

If you were to sign up this way and we did sign a corp. contract, Energy Central would credit you for the difference.

In the meantime, in response to your question, yes we can help you with this.  The best thing to do is go to http://esource.enron.com  at the top tool bar click on Request a Search.  Enter all of the detail you are looking for, and your timeline and we will be able to fill your request.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Thank you

Susan

In the meantime, do you guys have access to any gas supply production forcasts for the Rockies and San Juan Basin areas.  I'm looking into developing a new pipeline project and need to verify the gas supply will be there to fill the pipe.  Let me know.
thanks

Kevin,

Just a follow up.  I have put in a request for your Dow Jones User Id and password.  I should have this by tomorrow.  I have left a message for Ben Smith at Energy Central, and once I speak to him, I will let you know.


If there is anything else in the mean time, do not hesitate to call me.

Thank you

Women complain about premenstrual syndrome, but I think of it as the only time of the month that I can be myself.  -Roseanne 

Women need a reason to have sex. Men just need a place.  -Billy Crystal 

If you want to say it with flowers, a single rose says: "I'm cheap!" -Delta Burke 

I am not the boss of my house. I don't know when I lost it. I don't know if I ever had it. But I have seen the boss's job and I do not want it. -Bill Cosby 

In the last couple of weeks I have seen the ads for the Wonder Bra. Is that really a problem in this country? Men not paying enough attention to women's breasts?  -Jay Leno 

My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance.  -Tim Allen 

We have women in the military, but they don't put us in the front lines. They don't know if we can fight, if we can kill. I think we can.  All the general has to do is walk over to the women and say, "You see the enemy over there? They say you look fat in those uniforms."  -Elayne Boosler 

Always be nice to your children because they are the ones who will choose your rest home.  -Phyllis Diller

The post office says they're raising the price of stamps by one cent because they need to upgrade their equipment. Apparently, they're going from semi-automatics to Uzis.  -Conan O'Brien 

Electricity can be dangerous. My nephew tried to stick a penny into a plug.  Whoever said a penny doesn't go far didn't see him shoot across that floor. I told him he was grounded.  -Tim Allen 

If you can't beat them, arrange to have them beaten.  -George Carlin 

I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man I keep his house. -Zsa Zsa Gabor 

The problem with the designated driver program, is that it's not a desirable job. But if you ever get sucked into doing it, have fun with it.  At the end of the night, drop them off at the wrong house.  -Jeff Foxworthy

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

	

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

	Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

	713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Here's the hunting license info for OK.  $35 for a 5 day non-resident
license and $85 for a full season.  I'll see what I can find out about the
lease.

Windows 2000 Users
Since Outlook doesn't have an All Documents folder as Lotus Notes did, how do you find a message that you've "misplaced"?  Use the Advanced Find feature!  
Just right click on your top folder (Mailbox-) in the Folder List view and select Advanced Find.  Fill in what words you want to search for and what fields to seach in (subject, message body, etc) and click Find Now.  This searches through ALL the folders in your mailbox.... Enjoy!

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

As you are aware, the Corporate American Express credit cards have been cancelled, effective December 4, 2001.  We are working with American Express to establish new contracts for ETS employees. This will allow for reinstatement of service and a requirement for issuance of new cards.  We are expecting an answer from American Express on December 14, 2001.

Until advised, please limit travel and entertainment expenses.  If you are required to travel on business, you will need to use your personal credit cards or cash and submit your expenses through the XMS expense account system at:  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .   If the use of a personal credit card to cover your travel needs is not an option, cash advances can be approved by your immediate supervisor, and processed through your local administrative team.  In Houston, all cash advance requests, after obtaining proper approval, should be routed to Carolyn Centilli for processing. 

We will continue to update you of program changes as we continue to work with American Express.  If you have questions, please call Mary Ann Johnson - 713-345-5278 or Bruce Martin - 713-345-6527.

Kevin,

It was good to talk with you this morning.  As mentioned to you yesterday, =
following is some information on a project that I've been working on.  I'd =
appreciate your assitance in getting the word out regarding this project.  =
=20
As you are aware, there are many families that have been affected by the re=
cent layoffs at Enron.  I along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler a=
nd Sue Nix) have been working on a project which will provide assistance to=
 ex-employees of Enron. We wanted to do something to help our fellow employ=
ees and also provide a tool that others could use to provide assistance to =
ex-Enron employees.   Just think, if 100 people donated $50 each that would=
 be $5000 that we could give to ex-employees for assistance as needed for b=
asic necessities (such as money for food, to pay their rent/mortgage, or ut=
ilites).  I know the ex-employees would really appreciate this assistance. =
 I've already started getting e-mails at eerfarequest@surfmk.com requesting=
 assistance.  We've set up guidelines on how we'll be distributing the fund=
s. This week, we've been working with an attorney and a local bank. An acco=
unt has been set up where people can make contributions. All the money will=
 be given back to ex-Enron employees that need assistance with basic necess=
ities, such as money for food, rent/mortgage payments, and utilities. We've=
 contacted the local media with the information so that the community can b=
e made aware of what we're doing. Our ability to provide assistance will be=
 based on the response we receive.  As you can see, we're using our values =
from Enron to help others, and would appreciate your assistance with commun=
icating this information to the current Enron employees. =20

Please send this information in a general announcement to the current Enron=
 employees so they can be aware of a way to help their fellow ex-employees.=
  If you need to speak with me or have any questions, I can be reached at 2=
81-812-2466. =20

Contributions can be made to:=20

Humble Community Bank=20
1515 FM 1960 Bypass East=20
Humble, Texas 77338=20
281-540-1414=20
Account name: E.E.R.F.A. (stands for Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account)=

Assistance requests for basic needs from ex-employees of Enron can be sent =
to:=20
e-mail: eerfarequest@surfmk.com=20
fax: 281-812-2543

Thank you in advance for assisting with getting this information out.  I ho=
pe that you and your family have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Kevin:  I'm glad to hear you're still working (I think?).  At least in the 
pipeline group you have some hard assets to support the business.  I have 
been thinking about everyone we used to work with since this whole thing hit 
the fan.  I have a number of clients and friends who have been hit hard by 
the stock price meltdown.  One fellow I fly with is in his 60's, retired, and 
has lost so much he is having to go back to work.  All of the retirees are 
wondering about their pension payouts.  How's your retirement plan holding 
up?  

Greet Lou and the kids and anyone else from the old days who is still around. 
 Let me know how things are going.  And, DON'T shred this e-mail:)

Dear Eric,

I was referred to you by Kevin Hyatt.  Kevin and I worked together in the
ECT group.  At Kevin's request I have attached a r?sum? for your
consideration.  I have extensive experience in midstream field services and
business development.  I have implemented a number of complex projects
related to gas processing, fractionating, refining, petrochemicals, natural
gas and liquids gathering and transportation, and steelmaking and have been
instrumental in returning under performing assets to profitability.

An attribute that I can bring to the table is that I can relate to the
employees on all levels due to the practical hands-on experience that I have
been fortunate to acquire.  I have had the opportunity to personally buy
natural gas, develop gas gathering and processing plants, operate gas
plants, fractionators and storage facilities, develop gas and gas liquids
pipelines, market liquids, and even load trucks and tank cars!

I would be proud to be again associated with Enron.  I possess the
professional image, business principles, experience and record of
accomplishment required by Enron to effectively address the business
challenges it faces.  I would very much like to visit with you and your
associates in person to discuss my specific capabilities and qualifications.

Sincerely,

Steve Dickerson

http://www.journalstar.com/nebraska?story_id=5830&past= 
Brace yourselves, Nebraska football fans. The Huskers will feature a different look this coming season. 
No, Nebraska isn't switching to a pass-oriented attack. 
The Huskers, however, are in the midst of a significant change in uniform style. 
Although the details have yet to be finalized, the planned modifications will be the most extreme in several years. 
"It'll be the most significant change since I've been here," said Nebraska assistant equipment manager Mike Mason, who has been with the Huskers since 1988. 
Said Nebraska Coach Frank Solich: "There are certainly some noticeable changes, but the players seem to like the idea. And if you look around at pro and college teams, you see some changes." 
In Nebraska's case, Mason said, the most significant modifications will be in its road uniforms. The Huskers will wear white jerseys with a red strip around the collar and a red spandex insert - or gusset - down the sides. 
Mason said adidas - which has had a partnership with Nebraska to provide the Huskers with uniforms, shoes, etc., since the mid-1990s - would prefer the Huskers wear white pants with a 4-inch red stripe down the sides for both home and away contests (NU typically wears white pants with red jerseys at home and red pants with white jerseys on the road). But several players, Mason said, have expressed interest in wearing red pants with red jerseys for home games. 
"This isn't over yet," Mason said of the decision-making process. 
Some Nebraska fans may wince at the thought of a red-on-red combination. 
The last time the Huskers trotted onto the field at Memorial Stadium with that color scheme was in November 1986 for a game against nemesis Oklahoma. NU lost 20-17. 
The new home jerseys would be red with white piping down both sides of the red spandex insert. 
Solich said any remaining changes will probably be minor and will be subject to a vote of the team's Unity Council, made up of representatives from each position. 
Examples of the new uniforms are hanging in Nebraska's equipment room near the Husker locker room at Memorial Stadium. Because they're not the final versions, Solich requested they not be photographed. 
Solich said adidas representatives approached Husker officials in December about possible alterations, as is the case most every year. Although Solich discussed the changes with his assistant coaches, he mostly left the style decisions to the players, he said. 
"It'll certainly be different, but the colors will still be red and white - there will be no third color - and there will be no change whatsoever in the helmets," said Solich, who last season guided Nebraska to an 11-2 record in his fourth season as head coach. "Some things we just won't mess with." 
Pat Logsdon, Nebraska's director of football operations, likes the new uniforms. "I think they're nice-looking, and the guys love them," she said. 
Mason, though, was less enthusiastic. 
"I'm not sure the fans will like it," he said. "I don't necessarily like it." 
Added Solich, "Some fans don't ever want any change. Some do." 
The planned changes might come as a surprise to some fans, considering the importance Nebraska typically places on tradition. The new uniforms would be a departure from the simplicity in dress exhibited by such storied programs as Penn State, Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Alabama, to name a few. 
"I think the uniforms we had were fine," Solich said. "I think our coaches felt that way, too. But you always want to be open to change, especially if the players feel like they'd like to make a change - as long as it doesn't totally back away from Nebraska's tradition."

Due to the large number of moves recently, many locations and phones numbers are incorrect in Peoplefinder.  If your information is incorrect, our HR staff has sent the instructions below on how you can correct your data.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call us.

Mail stop - this is how your paycheck (if your pay method is hard copy) and other mail comes to you.  Updates should be e-mailed by the employee or a department administrative assistant to Kenneth Mathews along with the person's P number.  Here is a link to a mail stop listing so that you can choose the correct mail stop:

	http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp?cabinet_id=127   Select number 10. Mail Stop Listing.

Room Location - this is the room number that shows up in directories such as Peoplefinder.  Updates should be done by the each employee by logging in to eHRonline and choosing "Work Contact Information", make the change and save.

Work Address (street address) - this information is located on eHRonline under "Work Contact Information" but cannot be updated by employees; this address does not effect where you get your mail (the mail stop does).  However, it is being updated through HR by the ISC; it will be sometime next week before the ISC loads this information into SAP due to some other delays; this will change the address in eHRonline from 333 Clay to 1400 Smith

			Announcing     for ETS staff!

We are pleased to announce that ETS employees can now use the eRequest system.  This is the first step in our plan to migrate our security processing to eRequest.  eRequest is an electronic way to request access to applications/software, security, space allocation, XMS expense report set up, and access to conference rooms.  eRequest will take the place of submitting your request to the ETS Solution Center or the Omaha Helpdesk mailboxes.

There are a number of issues remaining to be addressed, specifically licensing costs for new software and the potential impact of the upcoming implementation of iBuyit.  However, we want to provide you with the opportunity to begin using the tool.

The steps are as follows:

Go to http://www.ets.enron.com ; select the Solution Center page; and then click on the   icon.
If you have a Corp id, click on the CORP LOGON button.  If you do not have a Corp id, select the NON-CORP login.  You will have to input your email id or select SEARCH and select your email address from a pick list.
If you have not used the system before, you will be prompted to set up a New Logon Profile.  You must provide your company number, cost center, social security number, location and phone number.
Select the button that represents the type of request you want to make (i.e., Update Account Access, New Account, etc.).
Confirm who the request is for; you may have to do a SEARCH to find your id.  Click OK when it's confirmed.
Select the service you desire (i.e., APPLICATIONS).
It is very important that you select ETS-GPG for your Region.  If you do not, your request will not be processed.
At the applications blank, select SHOW ALL.  The applications that will be of the most interest to you immediately are XMS, Corp Terminal Server, ETS Remedy, and Global Messaging (to request additional space for your Outlook mailbox).
If you are unable to locate the service you want, please contact us:
	ETS Solution Center-Houston  		713-345-4745 
		or toll-free  				888-465-4745

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Hi Gene, I just wanted to let you know, things here at Enron have been a
little hectic.  With the restructuring of our Broadband Services unit,
several hundred folks are looking to be "re-deployed" in the
organization.  This may make things a little difficult for outside
parties to gain entry; but I'm trying.

Also, I have a good friend who is a principal in a local head hunting
firm.  If you want, I can also forward your resume on to him.  Just let
me know if that's OK.
Best regards,

Kevin - 

Thanks for the referral.  Hope all is well with you.  

I agree with Billy on Michelle.  We are really focused on candidates with strong quantitative backgrounds and don't think that Michelle would be a fit for the program.  However, I will forward her resume on to Elyse if you would like. 

Also, just wanted to see if you wanted us to formally communicate our decision to Michelle or if you would be relaying this message to her.

Let me know

Traci

Kevin,

Thanks for the referral.  I've also copied Traci who leads Recruiting.  I don't really see Michelle as a fit in the Program.  A couple of years ago, the Program experimented with a Marketing track, but we've moved away from that concept.  We're now focused on trying to find people who can be successful in the Program at large.

You can try Community Relations (Elyse Kalmans) to see if there is any interest there.  Please let Traci know if her team needs to formally respond to Michelle.

I hope all is well with you, and thanks again for the referral.

Best regards,
Billy

I was wondering if we could get her in the next analyst candidate pool or look at placing her direct into something like community affairs if she was qualified?

Baylor team moves closer to solving MD puzzle 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Science Writer 
Scientists have known for a decade what mutated gene causes the most common
type of muscular dystrophy in adults, but until recently they have not fully
understood why the mutation causes the disease. 
Growing evidence, the newest of which will appear today in the journal
Nature Genetics, is giving medical researchers the answer to this "why"
question, which in turn should enhance their ability to devise effective
therapies. 
Baylor College of Medicine researchers will report perhaps the strongest
evidence yet supporting a theory that excess RNA, the molecule that spurs
production of proteins in the body, can effectively clog cells and lead to
muscle weakness and other ailments. 
"The more you know, and the better you understand how things work, the
smarter you'll be when developing drugs," said one of the study's three
authors, Dr. Thomas A. Cooper, a Baylor associate professor of pathology. 
Cooper and his Baylor colleagues, Drs. Rajesh S. Savkur and Anne V. Philips,
are studying patients with myotonic dystrophy whose faulty insulin receptors
do not process enough blood sugar for their muscles to work properly. 
The disease is particularly devastating, Cooper said, because it runs in
families, often getting worse with each subsequent generation. Afflicting
about 30,000 Americans, myotonic dystrophy worsens over time, weakening
muscles, causing cataracts and even mental retardation. 
"It's a very unfair disease to families," he said. 
The mutated gene of those with myotonic dystrophy makes too many copies of
RNA, which, in turn, produce the wrong types of proteins that muscles need
to process blood sugar. 
The genes of healthy people have only a few excess RNA copies, always less
than three dozen. Patients with moderate forms of myotonic dystrophy have
hundreds of copies, and the most severe forms of the disease, sometimes seen
in children, can have thousands of copies. 
Now scientists will know where to look for better treatments -- such as
dissolving the globs of RNA -- and in places they did not consider before. 
"This is a big step forward," said Dr. Sharon Hesterlee, director of
research development for the Tucson, Ariz.-based Muscular Dystrophy
Association, which helped fund the study. "The pieces of this disease's
puzzle are really beginning to fall into place. It gives us a much better
idea of what to target for therapies." 
Hesterlee said Cooper's work is consistent with research published in
another journal last month also supporting the theory that RNA blockages are
causing most of the symptoms of myotonic dystrophy. 
Cooper said the next step for researchers, having identified RNA as the
culprit, is to understand precisely why the excess RNA is botching efforts
by the body's cells to produce the correct proteins allowing muscles to act
as they should. That will provide more effective, targeted therapies, he
said.

...more than a third of workers plan to leave their current job within the next two years, despite the many layoffs in 2001. That lack of loyalty is almost unchanged from the economic boom days of 1999.(according to an article in the Houston Chronicle on Tuesday, September 4, 2001). 

There is a principle that endurance athletes must adhere to if they are ever to finish a long distance event - drink before you are thirsty. I think you will agree this principle applies to many areas of life and business. If we wait until the symptoms are easily observable, whether it is lack of employee retention or thirst, we have waited too late. 

We can be reasonably certain that the one-third who are considering a future elsewhere are not advertising their thoughts, which makes it even harder for leaders to recognize the symptoms. You can be sure of this though - the undercurrent of their attitude affects the whole organization!

Developing loyalty among employees is the same as satisfying a body's need for fluid - do it now if you are in it for the long term.  Here are some things to think about if you want to increase loyalty:

?        Given a lack of inspired mission, employees will remain in it for themselves.

?        Relationships deepen loyalty.

?        When leaders relate - employees give extra credit. Visiting them in their workplace, talking about family concerns, acknowledgement of tough times,  and a sense of humor all make employees feel like the leader is relating to them.

?        Take it personally. One act of concern lasts a lifetime.

?        Make employee loyalty a metric you measure yourself by. The higher up a person is in the organization the more this becomes a necessity.

Hi Kevin,

Thanks for your email.

Only Referrals that were initiated on the Referral Station would have tracking information available online.  My company, Referral Networks, hosts Enron's Referral Station website.

For Referrals that were made prior to the online system being live (May 18th), you would need to contact the Employee Referral Manager at Enron to answer your questions.

Whatever avenue you used before to check on your Referrals, I would still use for this particular one, since it was made in the past, prior to our live date.

If you have questions, you might try the Enron Recruitment Technology Help Desk at 713-345-3254, select option #2.

I hope this answers your question.  If you have any future questions about using the online Referral Station, please let us know.

Thanks,

Referral Networks Customer Support


--Original Message--

In April 2001 I submitted a candidate (Ms. Stacy Fitzgerald) for two
jobs (#107960 and #108040).  I also spoke with the hiring supervisor,
Mr. Derryl Cleaveland regarding the candidate and the positions.  Stacy
was subsequently interviewed for 108040 and began working for Enron on
May 7, 2001.

My referral submission was on paper, not electronically.  Am I eligible
for the finders fee?  I could not find anything on the Tracking part of
the web site.

thanks for the help.

Thanks for dinner last night - I enjoyed talking with you and meeting
Eric..... Here is the poem you requested.


Paranoid 

Do you really care what I have to say? 
Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway? 
Should I sit here like a statue in stone? 
Do I really like feeling so alone? 

What did I do to the world to feel this way? 
Why am I so paranoid everyday? 
My mind lives in a constant shade of black 
I always want to run and pack 

To find a world that's all my own 
Somewhere I can finally call home 
But the fear remains with me   
It's all I can see 

Why does everybody stare? 
Or even glare 
They say it's all in my head 
It's like I'm a ghost back from the dead 

It's scary to be left alone 
Even inside my own home 
Everyone's out to get me 
All after me 

Now when you ask me what's wrong? 
It takes me too long 
To figure out 
What the questions about 

Do you really care what I have to say? 
Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway? 
Should I sit here like a statue in stone? 
Do I really like feeling so alone?

	Hey Kevin,
	Here is my resume......somewhat updated.  I would like to have an
	opportunity to meet and provide a more detail discussion about my
	background and accomplishments that may be a really good fit for
	what ET&S is working towards.  

	Overall I've been with Enron since September of 1989.  My resume
	doesn't go back that far, but I started with Enron Gas Pipeline Operating
	Company (EGPOC) working with Transwestern and then Northern Natural.
	
	I'd like to see Enron grow and develop the asset part of our business
	and I truly believe that I can help accomplish that.  I have a strong history
	of getting things accomplished and I'm a firm believer in the win-win 
	business perspective. I also know how to work through the Enron
	organization to help get pricing, information, etc..

	I would like to establish an interview/meeting as soon as possible in
	order to be able to fully evaluate the opportunity.
	
	I would also appreciate that we keep this correspondence between
	us and the appropriate people within ET&S.

	Thanks,
	mk

Electricity Deregulation is coming to Texas!
What a great way to start off the New Year - to be able to choose your electricity provider, which could mean potential savings for you and your family on your electric bill.  As you know, Enron has been a leader in lobbying for deregulation and a consumer's right to choose energy providers.

For the first time in our state's history, 5 percent of Texas households will have this golden opportunity.  The NewPower Company (NewPower), which is approximately 45 percent owned by Enron, was recently formed to provide energy and energy-related services to residential customers in deregulating energy markets across America, including Texas.  For a limited time, Houston-based employees will be eligible to participate in NewPower's pilot program offering their deregulated electric service.

Be Among the First to Participate:
Enrollment with NewPower begins March 12.  Also, watch for a special Enron Employees Exclusive offer on your desk March 12.  If you would like more information about NewPower, visit the company's web site at www.newpower.com

Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, or any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.

If you go out to http://enron.ccsystems.com you can change your profile.  You need to change your room number to reflect your location on 40.

4082	Eric
4084	Steve
4085	Kevin

And you also need to change your mail stop to 4055.  This is the closest mail stop to us.

Sorry, but I don't have access to do this for you.  You will also need to change it on your HR location.  For some reason these two systems don't talk to each other.

Thanks!

Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program
?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below)
?         Press the # key
 
REVISED DIAL STRINGS FOR ENRON TIE LINE NETWORK
Users must dial 8 digits to call via Tie Lines

Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.

Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month

Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Spend and Approval Guidelines
Effective July 1, 2001

It is important that our business unit has a consistent, documented approach to spending to maximize our return on every dollar spent.  Enron Transportation Services will follow the spend and approval guidelines for the iBuyit eProcurement application.  Please review these new guidelines carefully and modify your purchase activities accordingly.

Many of you currently use iBuyit eProcurement to purchase IT hardware, and others began to use the tool on July 2, 2001, to purchase office supplies.  iBuyit eProcurement will automatically route purchase requests for approval based on our spend/approval guidelines.

Spend limit:  Defines the amount that each Job Title can spend without additional approval.	   				

Approval limit:  Defines the authority that each Job Title has to approve others' purchases.

	Example 1:  Specialist
	Any person in this job group could create and submit a requisition for up to $1,000 without any further approval.
			
	Example 2:  Director
	Any person in this job group could create and submit a requisition for up to $2,500 without any further approval and could 	approve others' requisitions up to $100,000.

Purchasing Review:  All IT equipment purchase requests require monetary approval and additional IT Technical review to ensure the request is aligned with Enron's IT strategy and standards.

Delegation Authority:  The iBuyit system allows a delegation process.  Approval can be delegated through substitution.  This substitution allows the delegation of approval authority, but not spend authority, up to the level of the delegator.

***ETS Approval Authorization Requirements supersede the iBuyit Spend & Approval Limit Guidelines for all commitments which obligate an ETS Business Unit.

Note:  If you haven't been migrated to Windows 2000 yet, these password requirements don't currently apply to you.  But since you'll be migrating within the next few weeks, please be familiar with the following....
Keeping Your Mailbox Clean
Since we have a 100MB limit on the size of our mailbox, it's important to practice good housekeeping and keep it as clean as possible. If you don't, you'll eventually receive the following message: 
You have exceeded the storage limit on your mailbox.  Delete some mail from your mailbox or contact your system administrator to adjust your storage limit. 

You'll then be unable to send messages until you get below the 100MB limit. Ouch!  (note:  mailbox limits will only be adjusted for specific business reasons)
So how do we practice good housekeeping and keep our mailbox clean? There are several tools to help you do this:
Use Your Inbox as a To-do List
Gone are the days when we could just read the new messages in our Inbox and then leave them there for future reference. You'll now need to keep that Inbox "lean-n-clean" to avoid the dreaded message above. When a new message comes in, deal with it right way. If it's just for your information, read it, then delete. If it's got information that you'd like to reference later, move it to a "save" folder that you've created. If it's someone asking for information, reply, then delete it. If a new message requires action on your part, leave it in the Inbox until you can then deal with it - Reply, forward, move, delete!. An empty Inbox is a happy one!
How Big are Those Messages?
When you were migrated, a column called "Size" was added to your Inbox, Deleted Items, and Sent Items folder views. This field shows exactly how much space each message is taking up (including any attachments). To quickly see the messages that are taking up the most space in each of those folders, simply click on the column header "Size" and the message list will be sorted based on the size of each message. The biggest messages will then be displayed first, and you can determine what to do with them. Should you just delete a message? Save the attachment to your H: drive?...etc.
If you'd like to add the Size column to any folders you've created, click the link below to access the instructions for modifying your columns.  
How Big is Your Mailbox?
To check on the total size of your mailbox, right-click on Outlook Today (at the top of the Outlook Bar or Folder List), and select Properties. Then click the Folder Size... button. The total size of your mailbox is then displayed, along with a breakout of each of the individual folder sizes. Now you know where to concentrate your attention when cleaning up.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A

Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:

---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Business cards are a great way to share information about yourself and your company when you want to network with others such as clients, businesses, vendors, and so on.  But if you are communicating via email, what do you do? A handy solution is electronic business cards, called vCards (virtual business cards), which you can send and receive in e-mail using Outlook  Many other e-mail and personal information manager (PIM) applications can use vCards as well, not just Outlook. For more information on vCards, visit the Internet Mail Consortium at http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcardoverview.html
Note: vCards are not needed when communicating with fellow employees, since we already have access to the Outlook address book and Peoplefinder. 
Settings Up Your vCard

1)  Verify Your Information
	- Open the address book ( )

IT Security & Controls - Password Security Notice
 
Passwords
The key to maintaining information and system security is the use of well-selected and guarded passwords.  Because your password is our first line of defense, stronger password selection criteria will soon be implemented for all employees.  

Password Policy

Passwords?
1.	must be at least of eight characters in length. 
2.	must not contain names, userids, common English dictionary words, and begin or end with a number.
3.	must contain alphanumeric characters and contain at least one special character. No more than fifty percent of the overall password can be in English.
4.	must not be reused or cyclical. 
5.	must be changed every 60 days.
6.	must not be publicly displayed.
7.	must not be shared with other users.
 
Choosing a good password comes down to two things.  First, avoid common everyday words a potential hacker's software will be looking for.  Second, keep your password  simple enough that you can remember it without having to write it down. 

Please keep in mind that the Enron Code of Ethics holds employees responsible for password security.  IT Security & Controls conducts periodic audits to ensure compliance with company policy. 

http://itc.corp.enron.com/data/policiesandprocedures/ITPasswordScreenSaver/

For any problems encountered concerning password controls, please call your appropriate Resolution Center (available: 24Hrs./day, 7 days/week).

It's not a problem.  I called the warehouse and since it hadn't shipped yet, they cancelled the order.  FYI, the new price on those went up to $960!!  I about crapped.

Hey Kevin...

You keeping busy over there??  (ok...  that was a bad joke)

I was wondering since it's taken these guys so long to ship, if it's too
late to just cancel the order.

At this point, I may want to do something different.

I appreciate your diligence in this process.

Let me know if this presents a problem.

Thanks again!

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents.

there's alot to be said for some straight-forward, plain-spoken wisdom right
now...

This is ABSOLUTELY the Quote of the Day from Bush when
asked what is taking so long:

"When I take action I'm not going to fire a $2 million missile at a
$10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt."

This Information Applies ONLY to Organizations Supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable Processing Centers 

Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement and payment tool, iBuyit eProcurement, is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central.  But there is still more to come! On May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of receipt and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issue resolution. 

In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the way you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these changes will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit Payables system. 

Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when placing an order and instruct them to reference this information:   
*  Company Number or Legal Entity Name
*  Contact Name 
*  Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order Number   
*  New P.O. Box  (See Below)

What is an EID? 
An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back to the purchaser electronically through iBuyit.  

Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders?
Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for non-purchase orders.

Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders?
No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do.  


What if I do not know my EID?
All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  You can access your EID number in eHRonline.  Logon to eHRonline, choose "Personal Information" to pull up your personal profile.  On the left side of the "Personal Information" screen select "Other" and you will see your:
*  PID (SAP ID)
*  GIS ID
*  EID

What is our new mailing address (PO Box)?
Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the following address:
PO Box 4734  
Houston, TX  77210-4734

What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me?
HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY
If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope "Attention Enron Accounts Payable," and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enron mail center.

FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY
If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable department in Houston.  Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following physical address:  
3724 Dacoma
Houston, TX  77092
ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

Note:  ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order invoices locally.

How will vendors learn about these changes?
This information will be shared directly with vendors in a separate communication.

Questions?  Send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>

We have been working hard over the past three months to restore normalcy to the non-debtor companies in the EGS family of asset-based businesses.   We are doing our best to operate on a business as usual basis, and continue the regular, consistent programs we previously provided.  That is why earlier this year we paid performance bonuses and merit increases to most non-debtor employees, in the ordinary course of business. 

At the same time, I understand that events of the past few months have been disturbing and left many with a sense of uncertainty about their future.  We realize that you need some sort of "safety net" to allow you to be comfortable staying here as we work to reorganize.  With this in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have put in place a severance plan for U.S. employees of certain non-debtor companies.  We have wanted this program for some time, but even as a non-debtor company we had to work extensively with consultants and creditors in securing its approval.

The severance plan provides that, under most circumstances, terminated employees would be eligible for two weeks of base pay for every full or partial year of service.  In the case of a termination due to reorganization, the minimum compensation would be eight weeks of pay and the maximum would be fifty-two weeks.  The details and restrictions to this plan are explained in the plan summary for your company's plan, which can be found on the ETS HR link on the Enron Transportation Services intranet site under "ETS HR Manuals". It can also be accessed by clicking on the attached weblink:  http://hrweb.enron.com/businessUnits/ets/etsHRmanuals.asp . 

I hope this plan will give you a bit more peace of mind and allow you to continue the excellent work you have been providing in our ongoing businesses.  Please contact your HR representative, if you have any questions about the severance plan or related matters.

Stan

The ClickAtHome portal (www.clickathome.net) will allow employees to access MS Outlook (email, contacts and calendars), eHRonline, PEP, and other employee applications via the internet using your existing network ID and password.  This functionality will be available mid-summer and will not require any action on your part.  

For other remote access requests, the Information Technology group (I.T.) is working on a solution to identify and address the issues involved in providing eligible employees approved access to the Enron Network and other applications by the third quarter.  You will receive future messages on our progress.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.
