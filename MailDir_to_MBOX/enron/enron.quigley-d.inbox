i will be on vacation for the next couple of days and ernie and i
will be going to play golf at meadowbrook farms (very good and
nice course) on moday morning.  i have two free rounds of golf and
we wanted to know if two of you would like to go.  if we got two
more we could split the price ($65 per) between the four of us.
that would be about $30 per person to play.  i realize everyone is
probably working but we thought we would share, and allow you guys
to play some golf with the uhhhfffllll league leaders and members
of the best division in our league.  we could even let you guys
pick our brains as to how we have been able to dominate the league
so far.

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Absolutely. We'll see you in John Arnold's office today at 2:30.

Have a good morning!

By the way, Kirk isn't in yet - so I couldn't ask him about Nymex's
website. I'll let you know as soon as I do.

   Good question. I am not sure what the copyright regulations are in
   regards
   to that website. I know we have full access to Enron's BRM course
   content -
   you can copy/paste straight from there.

   I will ask Kirk McDaniels about the Nymex website first thing tomorrow
   morning and get back to you.

   Have a good night.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

The NCAA is expected to move closer next week toward new
guidelines that one official estimates could pare as many as 20
schools from college football's big-time Division I-A.

The association's Management Council, meeting in Indianapolis on
Monday and Tuesday, will weigh proposed scheduling, attendance,
scholarship and other requirements designed to weed out I-A
pretenders and discourage lower-division wannabes. Further votes
are scheduled for the spring and, if ultimately approved, the
measures could go into effect in 2004.

They would require I-A schools to hand out at least 90% (or 76.5)
of the 85 football scholarships allotted to major-college programs
in a given season and offer a minimum of 16 sports (including at
least four men's and six women's) and 200 scholarships overall.

More problematic for some schools, however, could be additional
stipulations that football programs play at least five regular-
season home games vs. I-A opponents each season and average no
less than 15,000 in attendance. Twenty-eight of the 115 I-A
programs failed to meet one of those criteria over the past two
seasons, and several schools - including many in the Mid-American
Conference and the Sun Belt - fell short of both.

MAC member Kent State, for example, met four I-A opponents at home
a year ago and will play only four again this season, and the
Golden Flashes averaged a division-low 8,473 for home games vs.
major-college opponents the past two seasons. They drew just 2,973
for last week's victory over Northern Illinois.

"The track it's on right now, I would see maybe 20" schools
falling out of Division I-A, Management Council chairman Charles
Harris, commissioner of the I-AA Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.

In danger of falling from I-A

Among other things, if the NCAA approves proposed new criteria for
membership in Division I-A, schools will have to play at least
five home games vs. I-A opponents every year and average at least
15,000 in attendance - probably over a rolling two-year period.

Averaged fewer than five home games vs. I-A:

* Mid-American Conference (9): Ball State, Bowling Green, Buffalo,
Central Michigan, Kent State, Miami (Ohio), Northern Illinois,
Ohio U., Western Michigan.

* Sun Belt (7): Arkansas State, Idaho, Louisiana-Lafayette,
Louisiana-Monroe, Middle Tennessee State, New Mexico State, North
Texas.

* Western Athletic (5): Boise State, Louisiana Tech, Rice, San
Jose State, Texas-El Paso.

* Conference USA (3): Houston, Southern Mississippi, UAB.

* Independents (2): Central Florida, Utah State

Averaged less than 15,000 in home attendance:

* Kent State

* Eastern Michigan

* Middle Tennessee

* Akron

* Bowling Green

* Northern Illinios

* Arkansas State

* Louisville-Monroe

* San Jose State

* Buffalo

This crap is worse than the frickin BSC.  It's nice to see that Ernie
represented our division in the first round of the playoffs.  Way to go
jackass!  I of course would have lost in the first round also, but at least
I would have scored a legit amount of points.  Once again the flee circus is
winning with smoke and mirrors.  His last three week's scores don't even add
up to 100 and he won all three.  He must be cheating.  I would also like to
congratulate the Lions, I mean Extreme for its one win season.

>>> "Richard Smith" <ras1119@hotmail.com> 12/18/01 08:09AM >>>
This is a perfect example of why we cant change the rule about wild cards.
If Mark were to have his way he would have gotten the wild card even though
someone had a better record.  So I say screw any changes and obviously the
system works.

P.S.  Mark that really sucks to score the most points and not make the
playoffs.

The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which Enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form.  This allows Accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door.

The effort from the SME's should be complete by Christmas.  Please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer.

Phillip

Subject:	Zero Option


Phillip,


It will go along this lines: (Conservative)

*****************************************************
We pay "0" going forward
We have already played 300K in 3Q2001
Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002

Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally

We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K

Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use.

This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture

Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved.

***********************************************************************

If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or
				 2. Continue "as is" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate.	

Any comments or suggestions?


Regards,

Yevgeny

Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM "core" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov

For this first week you will be developing in Microsoft Word (or even in an
email) instead of the online content development tool. Below, I've included
the high-level outline for each content area that you should follow when
writing this content.

This Week's Assignment: This week's assignment will be to create two-three
paragraphs of content for each of the following areas:
1) Determining Option Premiums
2) Forward Market

Due Date: Friday, October 12th, 2001
 *NOTE: We are giving this assignment to you a few days early. In the
future expect your assignments on a Friday to be due by EOD the following
Friday.

Outlines to Help Guide You When Writing
Determining Option Premiums
   Inputs to determing options premiums:
   ?  Price Curve
   ?  Strike Price
   ?  Interest Rate
   ?  Volatility
   ?  Expiry or maturity
   Relationship between these inputs and how it relates to option premium
   (e.g. Holding all other things constant, if volatility increases, what
   does this do to your option premium?)

Forward Market
   Traded on the OTC
   Known counterparty
   Prices are transparent
   Comparison to spot market
   Expiry and settlement

Finally and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the the ability of our BRM project
to stay on schedule and within budget. If you are unable to complete an
assignment for a given week, please notify me ahead of time and provide an
estimated time for completion of that assignment.

Thank you.

John and Dutch -

This email is sent to discuss what is needed with respect to NYMEX quotes from the broker market.  Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.  It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:

1.  Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)

2.  Seasonal quotes (winter '03, summer '04, etc.)


In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.  I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.  We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.  We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.

Also, I am aware that our current position doesn't give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.  However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.  Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.  Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.  

Please let me know if the brokers are not accomodating your requests; we may need to ask John or Louise to place calls into the brokers to move this process along.

If you have any questions or comments, you can normally find me in the "war room" next to Louise's office.  If I'm not there, please call me at (713) 927-3003 or at ext 53923.


Thanks,

Jay

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

then i will try my luck here:

i've got 4 talented receivers in holt, pathon, muhammed & t. taylor.  i need
to establish more than 8 points over 5 weeks from my rb position.  to date
i have received offers like pinkston, price, garner, mack or allen and
flutie.  is it getting this bad where i'm actually considering these guys just
to spawn some new life into my team????  i certainly need rb help but
could use a back up qb as well.

All transactions must be completed by this Thursday at 9am due to the game on Thursday night.  After the game starts on Thursday, no transactions will be accepted.  For players that are playing in the game on Thursday, please remember to change your lineups before the game to include or exclude them.  You can still make changes to your lineup after Thursday for players that do not play in the game on Thursday.

Thanks,

Hi Dutch --

Since you offered to answer some of my questions over e-mail, I will take
you up on it!    I would still like to get some of your time Monday or
Tuesday to go into more detailed discussion.

Question 1:
When we talk about "the market" reacting to events, what are the prices
that we are talking about? From a simulation standpoint, I am trying to
figure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many
events.  Is it the forward curve? Is it the spot market price?  Is the
bid/offer prices for the various instruments? And, if we are having users
trade basis, we will need different prices for different locations, right?

Question 2:
Given that the calculation of VaR is rather involved, we decided that it
would not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model.
However, we understand that the user needs to 1) know their VaR and 2) know
that they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit.  So, we will
need to set a VaR limit for the user and "fake" the individual VaR to
reflect their risk exposure.

I had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this.  He made a good point that if
our user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is
calculated, will they know how to control their VaR, i.e. if a user sees
that he is over his VaR limit, what should he do to get it back within the
limit.  Is is as simple as not being too long or too short? And if that is
the case, would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy
for risk exposure, instead of VaR?

One possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how
exposed the user is. So if they are X dollars long, they have a VaR of Y.
If they change their position so that they are now 1.5X long, they have a
VaR of 1.5Y.  Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account
market volatility.

What are your thoughts?


Lastly, when could you meet with me next week? I would really like to meet
on Tuesday, if possible.

Thanks so much for your time, Dutch.

Have a terrific weekend!
Ann

I know someone in IT picked the computer up to send back to NYMEX.  I don't have confirmation if they had sent it back prior to the filing.  I have called this individual several times at home but have not heard back.

Danielle:

It was never moved here from ECN during our move.  Do you have a bar code or any type of serial number for me to be able to find it?  I don't see how the computer could have just dissappeared. When Dutch originally talked to Paul Jordan and told him that it was not being used anymore, he was going to have it moved. Who else can we talk to about where this computer could have gone?  I will go over to the new building tommorrow and take a look again.  Will you meet me there?  I will call you before I go.

John,

If you cannot locate your NYMEX access computer terminal its cost will be docked from your cost center.  You need to get it tracked down ASAP!

Do you know if anyone from your group picked up a computer from John Arnold's old desk on 32 that was an HP or IBM?

Hey Dutch,
I had lunch with Kay yesterday and she suggested I email you.  Would you be
able to find tickets to the Dixie Chicks at the rodeo?  I will pay.  I
wasn't sure if you were still talking to any brokers that had some
available.  If you don't, no big deal.  Just thought I would try.  Hope all
is well.
Thanks,
Rebecca P.

Good question. I am not sure what the copyright regulations are in regards
to that website. I know we have full access to Enron's BRM course content -
you can copy/paste straight from there.

I will ask Kirk McDaniels about the Nymex website first thing tomorrow
morning and get back to you.

Have a good night.

Hey everyone,
Just finished working my first full week at Deer Valley.  The resort opened
friday and from tues through sunday I worked with the other bakers to get
items prepped and inventories stocked up for the mad rush of skiers expected
over the weekend.

I am enjoying working under the pastry chef at the lodge I am at.  He is
very dilligent about coming over and making sure you understand the how's
and why's of the recipe you are making.  His explanations are scientific
when they need to be and straightforward when they don't need to be long and
drawn out.  I'm confident that I will learn a lot from the other chefs and
bakers there as well.

The first few days were very frustrating.  There are a group of bakers,
level 3's, who work at the lodge every winter and supervise the new bakers.
There were a few tasks that I was assigned to do along w/ these level 3
bakers.  We were cutting cakes in half and I was doing it the way Patrick
always showed me and she said that I shouldn't do it that way ...to do it
another way.  Then one of the girls at my level with the $40k diploma from
the CIA asked me if I had ever cut a cake before (like asking someone if
they are retarded).  I couldn't see straight I was so frustrated.  Later, I
was shaping baguettes..again..the way I learned...and the level 3 told me to
do it another way...and that our boss Steve who studied bread could show me
later since he knows so much.  Well when he came over later ...he did it
almost exactly the same way I did.  There are lots of stories like this from
those first few days.  I had to bite my tongue a lot.  One girl claims she
can tell when bread is done proofing by looking at it...and doesn't have to
touch it (why wouldn't you touch it..thats the best part).  I might believe
that from someone in their 40's but not a 20 something who has only been
baking a few years.  So I went home completely frustrated the first 3 days,
but I had to remind myself that school was 2yrs ago for me and for many of
these girls school was last month or a few months ago.

We have a lot of people in the kitchen who hail from the CIA, which for
those of you who might not know..it is a school that cranks out culinary
grads for around $40,000 for the entire program.  People keep asking me if I
am doing my externship from the CIA......kind of like when I was at enron
and people kept asking me if I was in the analyst/associate
program...equally annoying.  BUT, since I am dilligently learning to look at
the bright side of everything...the good part about having all of these
culinary school people around is that it makes the environment more
professional and competitive...which in the long run is a great environment
for me becauses it pushes me to be that much better than everyone else.  And
though I look at some of these 23yr olds who can technically do everything I
can do at such a younger age...though I catch myself wishing I had done this
a long time ago,  I am glad I am doing this at a time in life when I have a
ton more maturity and a vision of what I want to do with this experience.

Today and tomorrow are my off days.  For my friends who are living
vicariously through me...yes I have been skiing and hopefully will get out
there later on this afternoon.  Tomorrow I have an interview with another
bakery in town that I am considering working part time at.  Hope everyone is
well, especially my friends at ENE.
Best!
Mo.

Attached are the futures positions for each of wti, heat, and unleaded.

Still don't know exactly what you want to see for the options positions (gross, net, strike by strike, longs separated from shorts, etc).  Please let me know.  Also, the risk guy that put the below together for me tells me that Jeff Shankman is asking for similar info.  Please let me know if we are doubling up on the effort - - if so, i will let him get it.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

It was great meeting you last Tuesday. I really enjoyed working on the NYMEX
Desk at TXU this summer and it was good to talk to you about trading and the
natural gas market. It looks like the bottom fell out of the market on
Wednesday after the AGA number. Our model was calling for an 82 so I think we
were closer than most but not close enough. Its a tough number to pin down as
their adjustment to the 3 testifies. Do you think there is a lot more downside
in this market or do we need to wait til after hurricane season for another
large sudden move downward?

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me and I look forward to speaking with
you again soon.
Regards
Dan

Due to the change of servers and moving of all ERMS  databases to the new locations old curve fetch files are not working properly.

I got our IT guys to fix the file you gave me. Everything looks OK now.

I got the new file attached.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Friends:

As of last week, I am unemployed. I'm currently looking for a new job
possibly doing the same thing or maybe a sales/marketing for the college
industry. If yall hear of anything, please send it my way, I may be coming
back to Texas as well. I will let yall know and appreciate any help you may
give me. As I explore my options, I'll decide exactly what I'm looking for.

okay - here's what i know -- we are trying to hire some of the best
people out there at whatever they may do -- one position that we are
looking at is kinda what you are already doing -- our nymex trader is
bob shiring -- take that however you wish -- but that's who you  would
be working directly with so that's who you would need to talk to.  i
know this position is in the budget for this year but i'm not sure what
the time frame is.  bob's email is bob.shiring@rweamericas.com -- you
can tell him that you got his name from me and then i'm sure he'll
approach me about it -- that is, of course, if you are interested and to
the extent that you do not have any contractual issues in talking to us.

Intercepted Memo From Osama Bin Laden 
Here is a memo we have Intercepted from Osama Bin Laden to all of his
Cavemates. 


To: Cavemates

From: Bin Laden, Osama 

Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 8:17 AM 

Subject: The Cave 

Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours in this conflict but we've
finally come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for
putting up the poster that says "There is no I in team" as well as the one
that says "Hang In There, Baby." That cat is hilarious. However, while we
are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly
I have a few concerns. 
First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we
should be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you
don't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily.

I've posted a sign-up sheet near the main cave opening. 
Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to
scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're
taping, please do not ride your razor scooter in the background. Just while
we're taping. Thanks. 
Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not
supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,
especially after mealtime. We're all in this together. 
Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote "Osama" on
the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone.
Consideration. That's all I'm saying. 
Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying
to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First
patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and the new guy Richard. 

Love you lots. 

Osama B.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

Over the past few weeks we have held several "Breakfast Club" meetings to update members of the Program and business units leaders on the results of the recent Program Survey, to discuss several initiatives we have underway, and to provide an opportunity for Q&A.  

I want to invite any of you who may not have been able to attend one of these four meetings, to a final meeting on Tuesday, October 30.  The meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A continental breakfast will be provided. 

Because space in this room is limited, please rsvp to my assistant Maxine Levingston by 12:00 noon on Monday, October 29.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com> <<mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com>>.

Best regards,
Billy Lemmons
Vice President, Associate / Analyst Program
