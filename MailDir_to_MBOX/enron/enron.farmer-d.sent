Sandi, 

Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.  

The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on CPI.

Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do 
you agree with this?

Daren,
When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me 
how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year? 
based on what index?

Thanks,
Sandi

Mtr 1600- A deal already exists for this meter (#159194).  If you view the 
meter in MOPS you can see the deal.  (It had zero volume before today.)

Mtr 6725 - This gas is traded on the spot market, so there is no deal to put 
in.

Subject: 98-1600 & 98-6725 Needing K's

Daren,

I hate to be a pest but here's the deal on the above two meters:

98-1600  Sitara deal #159194 expired on 2/29/2000.  The flow for 2/2000 was 
on the 215K.  This meter (del.) flowed 53.863 for 3/2000.  There is no   new 
deal referenced, nor is the evergreen flag in effect.

98-6725  Sitara deal #214948 expired 3/27/2000.  No evergreen and no new deal 
referenced.  This is a little premature but this meter is active   monthly 
and I'm thinking that it will flow for this month with no K being applied.

Thanks
-Jackie-

Aimee, 

You need to set up a transport capacity ticket in Sitara for this.  Heidi 
Withers should be able to help you.  I don't know the contract to apply to 
the deal. Heidi or Julie Meters may be able to help with this also.

Daren,

I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on 
the first two days.  However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we 
have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few 
days in the middle.  Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85% 
of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on Strangers until we determine 
what to do.  I am now on the dreaded ua4 list from Vol. Mgmt.

This is a estimate for UA4, fuel, loss, and various other operational

I think I hate football too.  4th and goal on the 3 yard line, to win the 
game, and RC decides to change his lifelong coaching strategy from run, run, 
run, to pass the ball.  Why not Ja'mar??  The guy who carried 3 defenders 
into the end zone earlier.  Anyway, we beat the spread and I got $20 from 
your friend Mary.  So things are not all bad.

How did the Corn boys lose?  If I would have known about it on Saturday, I 
would have called to console you and the family.  Maybe it's time to just 
turn our attention to the NBA and leave this heartache behind.

So here's where we should be now with Carbide:

Texas City - 10,000/d of the term deal, plus 14,000/d of safety net, total

Subject: HPL Meter SOUTHERN UNION - LOCKHART

Daren:

On 5/31/2000 the above meter has recorded flow of 16 Mmbtus from HPL's 
pipeline.   Deal #254839 was at the meter prior, but it expired on 5/21/00.  
Currently, the volume is booked to HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics 
needs either (1) have Deal #254839 extended, (2) new deal, or (3) approval to 
writeoff these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and 
return original to Clem Cernosek).

Normally we inactivate old deals on the first Sunday of the month that lies 
closest to the 10th.
The job takes a long time and is run over the weekend. This Sunday (the 8th) 
we will inactivate
all the March deals. This is done to reduce the volume of deals in Sitara so 
that performance
(speed & stability) can be enhanced. The only application that this really 
affects is Position Manager.
Our IT department has asked if they can do this for all the April deals on 
May 6th next month.


Any concerns, please call the Sitara Hotline 853-7049

Thanks

The term contract with Four Square attached to deal #138049 has been 
terminated.  Therefore, we need to take that deal to zero for August 2000 
forward.  Additionally, we entered into a base load (August only) deal to 
purchase the gas from Four Star at mtr 6599 (#348446).  The 1,500/day should 
be schueduled on this deal.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

 Deal 138049 is committed reserve long term gas totaling 1,350mm per day 
which is a good deal.
 
 However, deal #:  348446 is a  duplicate deal which was overstated and 
should be zeroed out {bad deal}.
 
 This is Vance response to an inquiry made by Bob.
 
 Daren, do you want me to zero out  deal #: 348446 ?

Daren - was there a deal for 5.000 at CP&L on Feb. 21?  CP&L shows 5.000, but 
I have looked in MOPS and there is not a deal.  Can you verify whether or not 
there was a deal for that day?  Thanks.

I received a call from CP&L about the February 2001 production invoice.  They 
are showing 5,000 mmbtu on February 21 for HPL.  We are not showing anything 
for HPL on that day.  Could you verify if this is correct?

Thanks for your help.

Megan, 

For 8/1/00, allocate the receipt of gas a Cotton Valley to the exchange 
deal.  Since we did not deliver anything to them on that day, the settlement 
will occur at GD-.10.  Originally, we were working on a spot deal for this 
day.  Then, after the fact, we agreed to let the deal fall out under the 
exchagne deal.  I apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket.

For the weekend of 8/5, we need to prorate the gas over the weekend.  Due to 
operational issues, we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the 
deliveries on Monday.  I apologize for not getting this info to you earlier.

Daren:
I am having trouble with 8/00.  The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at 
Fuels Cotton.  We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange 
deal 157288.  You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had 
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing.  Since there was a 
spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951.  Duke says that 
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at 
GD - 0.10.  The exchange deal is currently price at index - 0.05.  Please let 
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be.  
The second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8/00.  Duke is telling 
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are 
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange.  This 
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5th and 6th and pipeline 
shows all of the gas on the 7th.  This is a daily swing meter which 
electronically feeds into settlements.  We don't normally change these 
meters.  If you intended for us to prorate this gas, I will need your OK. The 
emails below are from Marta at Duke notifying us of the change.

Read information below and see if this helps one of the unresolved problems
for August.

 Megan can you tell me how you arrived at the price for August 1?  I do not
know why August 1 would be priced differently than the other days of the
month when we had over deliveries for the Fuel Cotton Valley gas.  This is
priced at HSC daily - .10 per paragraph 3 of the contract.  If a different
price was worked out with Darren, I do not have record of it.  Darren is
out until next week.

Susan, 

I need you to do the research on this meter.  You will need to review the 
various scheduling systems to see how this was handled prior to 2/96.  You 
can also check with Volume Management to see if they have any info regarding 
the allocation of the point.  Let me know what you find out and I will work 
on getting a deal in place.

Mary,

This is all the information that I have when Ami first looked at all the CES 
information.  It does not mention a processing agreement, but that does not 
mean that there isn't one.





Daren - do you know anything about a processing agreement for the Devon gas

Daren,

 I apoligize for the late notice.  I didn't realize that we would need your 
help until this morning.  Please let me know the time that is convenient for 
you (tomorrow ?) and I will schedule another meeting.  We need to discuss the 
purchase deals on MidTex Pipeline, at meters 0393 and 0391 (HPL's meter#s).  
The first deal is with Etoco, original deal 44829 (12/98-12/99), which has 
been moved to 133435 for Jan 2000 and going forward.  The second meter has 
desk-to desk deals starting Jan 99 to present.  These deals need to be 
scheduled on MidTex meters instead of HPL's meters.

Thu
3-7159

I need some further information on the folks below.  Please respond to this 
request by letting me know the following:

 1) In what area is this person working?

 2) Who is their manager?

 2) What type of Pipeline Operations access does this person need (read, 
update, none at all)?

 3) In the future, please include the above info on the request in the 
comments section.  To include a statement like "please give Delma Salazar 
the   same access as Bob Smith" would help greatly.

Here are the people that I need more info on:

  Tom Hook
  Demmy Adeshola
  Rebecca Griffin
  Jason Vogler
  Paul Couvillon
  Bob Fischer
  Delma Salazar

My goal is to get your folks access to the Pipeline Operations module as soon 
as I can.  With your help, I will be able to achieve this in the quickest 
time possible.

Thanks,  MVE

As discussed in our 3-Rivers/King Ranch meeting, I have set up purchases from 
the liquids group and the other 3rd parties at HGPL mtr 0012.  Due to 
bridgebacks, I had to create new deal numbers for the days prior to 2/16/99.  
(I went back to Dec 1999, in case it is needed.)  Please see the deal #s 
below.

Teco  113858 &169759
HPLR Liquids  114099 & 169765   (existing deal to cover excess residue)
Swift  93779 & 169761
ERAC  138094 & 169760
Tejones 133173 & 169762


Mandy - I understand that you will be setting up the buy and sale with HPLR 
Liquids to cover the transport on HGPL.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I don't know what you're smokin up there, but every one of those deal numbers 
you listed are WRONG.  

Deal 633842 is valid for mtr 416.  It has a zero nom.  You can send that to 
POPS or path a volume to the deal and send it on.
I added the 15th-18th to deal 621598 for item (2).
Deal 529738 is valid for mtr 1598.  It has a zero nom, also.

2. meter 1601 had flow on the 15 &18.  This is Southern union Lockhart.  Last

3. Meter 1598 had flow the whole month 1-28.  This is MT Enterprise C/G-

 First of the month  industrials are coming along fine.  I will finalize my

     The industrial "Buyback & Deficiency Deals" worksheet  has captured the

      myself and Client Services.
      I  will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day Friday.

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

later.  I will probably be on vacation next Mon and Fri.  You can start with 
me tomorrow or next Tuesday, it's up to you.  We usually start trading around 
8:30.  We usually start the day at 7:30 with the Gas Control and Weather 
meeting.

Daren,

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a 
general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that 
it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.

I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not 
be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day,  
morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good 
time.  I think it will help me very much in my role.

Thanks.

Mike

With PMA's, volumes can be adjusted through the system as usual and I can 
adjust the demand fee on the Sitara ticket.  I am not able to follow your ua4 
calculation.  However, there was imbalance payback that occurred throughout 
September and October.  (This should have been pathed to the Lone Star 
transport k in Unify).  Is this in that ua4 number?  Williams had been trying 
to make up volumes from prior periods, so that's probably why their volume 
came in greater than booked.  (Much of their gas is from El Paso and volumes 
vary each day from scheduled.)  The volumes that they were trying to make up 
would go toward the transport imbalance also.  I would think that Cleburne 
will carry an imbalance on Lone Star from month to month.  After Novemeber, 
the imbalance should be fairly small.  Our scheduler, Mark McCoy will have 
that number.  (When we took over this deal, the imbalance on Lone Star was 
very large.   When the plant went down in Sep, we decided to payback the 
imbalance then, so that we could take advantage of higher winter sales prices 
if the opportunity came up.)

The agreement does not specifically state anything about ua4.  But, I will 
discuss that with Legal.  The intent is for all costs, including ua4 and 
fuel, to be covered by Tenaska IV.

I will be leaving at 1pm today and will return on Tuesday 12/19.  We can get 
together then if you would like.

Darren, 
The demand fee is probably the best solution.  We can use it to create a 
recieivable/payable with Tenaska, depending on which way the calculation goes 
each month.  How are PMA's to be handled once the fee been calculated and the 
deal put in the system?

Attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the GL for Cleburne as of 
today.  Some of this info will change by the end of the month.  As you can 
see, there are some discrepancies between Megan's calculations and what is on 
the general ledger.  UA4 is also on my schedule.  Unless the buys/sells are 
volumetrically balanced, we book an entry to balance the desk.  This will 
change the calculation of what is due from/to Tenaska.  Should we be 
recording a UA4 entry for Cleburne?  Is it addressed in the agreement with 
Tenaska?

Subject: Tenaska IV 10/00

In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related 
to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the 
majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing 
money to Tenaska IV.

I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the 
calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached 
schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay 
this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do 
this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in 
the future.

Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.

Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.  
Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we 
reimburse Tenaska IV.

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized 
through legal.  However, we were able to "get between" a few deals and make 
some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 
8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold 
to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not 
enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with 
the customers. 

Buy from Tenaska IV
 July 399763
 Aug 399773

Sell to Tenaska Marketing
 July 399791
 Aug 399797

Sell to ANP
 Aug 399814

The trading desk these are on is "ENA-IM Cleburne".

Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany 
mail.  (I received both invoices this week)

 I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.  Tanks.

for a week from 7100 to 4400 for the last week or so needs to stay at the 
4400  for the rest of the month.  I  changed the ticket for that.  This was 
per Suzanne Saldivar.  Also Shoreline reduced the meter 6722 from 30 to 24.  
also changed that. last Cody went from 7666 to 7600 at meter 6722.  Both 
Shoreline and Cody were per customer request.

Hey, Dwight.

Everything is going fine here.  Thanks for your message.  I'm feeling pretty 
confident with how things are going.  I have received very positive feedback 
from my manager and my employees.  I have learned much from you, especially 
related to communication:  recognizing the different types of people, 
different ways to communicate.  And, I appreciate the time you've spent with 
me.  However, I would like to discontinue our sessions for the time being.  
When I'm in need of some "managing expertise" in the future, I will give you 
a call.  

Again, thanks for working with me.

Daren

Megan, 

I have changed the pricing on deals 452491 and 452475 for October flows to 
mtr 25000200.  These flows should be priced at $.10 + 1/2 % fuel.  The $.11 
that Lone Star billed us is incorrect on the last deal.  I'm not sure about 
the rates for mtr 20014903.  The person who can tell us should be in 
tomorrow.  I will leave a note for her.  We should have similar deal tickets 
for Dec forward.  I will check with Mark and Trisha.

Have you been able to work out these transport pricing differences for Oct. 
2000?  We have only been able to pay $4,000.00 of the $28,000.00 invoice.  
The pricing for Nov. 2000 (deal 452491) has problems too.  We have $0.01 for 
11/3 at meter 20014804 and TXU is billing us $0.10 at meter 25000200 and 
$0.02 at meter 20014903 for the entire month.

I have also noticed that we are not accruing any transport for Dec 2000 
forward.  We have received the Dec. 2000 invoice from TXU, but we do not have 
a deal to pay them.  We should be getting Jan. 2001 next week.  Is there a 
deal for these months?

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Thanks,
Megan

Mandey, 

The Cox contract expired effective 12/1, so we should not have any gas coming 
to us from them.  The confirmation with PG&E should be adjusted. The Tribo 
deal is good.  If PG&E allocates gas to them, we are ok.  (I don't think they 
have been allocated gas in the last 7 months.)  Carlos probably has a contat 
with Cox.  Either you or he can call them to see if they have sold any of 
their interests.

Subject: Cox Exploration

Darren,  we had a situation in December that we need your help to resolve.

Deal #125836 We have been purchasing gas from Cox Exploration on PG&E 
Hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility.  This purchase 
agreement terminated 11/30/99.  I didn't path the gas on PGEH, however, I 
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at 
Thompsonville.  I didn't catch this and the Deal on the HPL side appeared to 
be a valid flow issue for Kim Vaughn.  The plant continued to confirm this 
gas.

We have tried working through the pipeline, but they state that they will not 
know anything until the 15th.  Can you contact the producer and ask them to 
reverify this with the pipeline?  I would like Kim to be able to zero confirm 
and send back to Pops so Volume Management will not allocate up to the 
producer level.

Also I just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at 
the same meter with Tribo Production.  Should there have been an expected 
volume in this Deal?  Is it possible that Cox exploration sold their interest 
in this well to Tribo.  It may turn out that we should have flowed the gas 
after all.

The buy and sale should net out, nothing to be billed to paid to TGLO.  The 
volumes should be the same on both sides.  Whoever backs up Tom should

Deal # 421847 Purchase

Settlements is showing both a sales and purchase for Texas General Land

anything. 
Are these deals suppose to be a washout and netted together? 

 If so, the volumes are not matching: the sales on HPL are 7,440 mmbtus on 
deal #421859 and the purchase on MidTX is 6,629 mmbtus. 
Let me know what type of deal this was intended to be.

I was told that Tom Acton was handling this deal, but I believe he will be

There is a feedback error on swing meter 981595, deal number 151203 for 
January 2000.  POPS and MOPS systems match, however in checking in Sitara, 
the deal number attached expired 12/31/99.  

I am not sure you are the correct person to address this with, if not, please

The Global Octanes plant crashed last night.  The undertakes (volume below 
the base load sale) will not go to the buyback.  This is considered a force

Julie, 

What info do you have on the Praxair deal (#70171)?  Should this be on ENA or 
HPLC?

Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ENA sales customers.  I 
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that Brenda 
needs.  I am confused about Praxair though.

The sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/ 10/1/99.  
The only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial 
Agreement.

Does Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If it 
really needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment to 
HPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair.

Please advise.

Cheryl, 

The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:

City of Brazoria
Central Illinois Light Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Markham Gas 
Merit Energy Partners
Praxair
Reliant Energy - Entex
Reliant Energy - HL&P
Southern Union Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co)
Union Carbide Corporation
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc


ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most 
likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)

All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be 
generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let me 
know if you need something like that.  

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Just to update you on this project's status:

Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come up 
with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas off 
of HPL's pipe.

Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc.
Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc.
Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex
CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P
Central Illinois Light Company  Southern Union Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution
Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation
Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.


Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes 
suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing 
something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him 
and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the 
above contracts.

Subject: ENA Sales on HPL

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you 
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for 
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & 
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to 
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is 
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity 
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will 
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in 
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas 
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some 
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.

In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related 
to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the 
majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing 
money to Tenaska IV.

I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the 
calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached 
schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay 
this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do 
this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in 
the future.

Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.

Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.  
Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we 
reimburse Tenaska IV.

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Melissa, 

It would help us considerably if Vance would include the prices for new deals 
in the monthly nom.  In order to manage our postion and schedule the gas, we 
need to put the deals into Sitara.  We will enter spot deals with the info 
Vance gives us.  When the deals are ticketed, the risk group will adjust 
Sitara with the finalized terms.  

Thanks for your help.

Daren, 

Per our phone conversation, please find the following information:

Camden Resources Inc., Driscoll Ranch #1, meter 9858, price:  HSC less $0.10
North Central Oil Corporation, McMurrey-Talbert #2, meter 5228, price:  HSC 
less $0.14
KCS, Dickenson, meter 9797 - Susan Smith will be preparing a formal ticket 
for the Buy and the Sell for the month of October.  We will be watching the 
gas specs on this package, and if all goes well, we will book the rest of the 
term at the end of October.

On a go forward basis, for gas that we provide in the monthly nomination that 
we know is not ticketed, can Vance just include the price in the comments 
field on each package to help you estimate for bid-week?  Let us know if this 
information will be helpful in the future.

Thank you,

CR and AL, 

We bought 8000 from Richardson (#245410) at Teco - Lone Star Katy and sold it 
to Tufco at that point on 5/12/00.  At 3am Tufco cut us on the sale, 
resulting in only 6,000 flowing to Tufco for the day.  We need to find out 
what PGE did with the remaining 2,000 we bought from Richardson.  Did they 
deliverit to us at HPL?  Or did they cut Richardson?  Or, are they showing 
that we have gas stranded at that point?  Please look into this and let me 
know.

Lee, 

I would like to deliver as much of Midcon's gas as possible to Mobil 
(25,000-30,000) for February.  When the work is going on, we can move that 
around.  Also, we have 10,000 baseload on Centana we need to deliver to the

Mobil says the low point of their takes will be during February will be from 
Feb 1 to 14.  So any day in that time period would be a good time for HPL to 
do the required maintenance at the Texoma-Beaumont system interconnect.

We need to define our game plan: 
- what day to do the work
- how much gas HPL will deliver through our own meter
- how we use Centana to deliver the rest of the HPL volumes
- if we had planned in Feb to baseload some of our MidCon obligation at Mobil 
as we have done in Dec and Jan, then we will need to do something different 
whenever we do the maintenance

James - we are scheduled to meet with Mobil in Beaumont at 10.30am Thursday 
Feb 1, to go over the game plan with them.

Pat - do you want anyone from HMS to attend?

Thanks

Lee

Steve, 

How are things going with this request?

FYI.  The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.  Only 
sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA.

Dan, 

ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines 
(listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the 
majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to 
HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process

Tom, 

I changed the meter on deal 156161 from7012 to 7341.  You will need to repath 
and renom this in MOPS.  Also, you will need to make sure that the welhead 
meteres are linked to 7341 in POPS.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Daren,   I just talked to Mary and she said that they developed the meter 
987341 for the meters that you had nominated under the 987012.   Under 
Aggregate 7012 is 4045;  6026; 6114; 6427; 6848; 9755 ;  these should all be 
under the 987341.  Do we need to renominate these meters or do I just move 
them in pops.  Let me know Daren  I aim to please ( I think that's a southern 
term!!)

don't have a lot of info to dispute their price.  It's not cost beneficial to

Charlene, 

We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29-30th.  No price was 
negotiated that I can find. However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last 
price on the deal to cover those days.  What price is Hesco showing?

Meter 986725 for March 2000.   Per Hesco both traders are gone at (Hesco and 
Enron)  and they (Hesco) were not paid  the correct price  in March on the 
days mentioned below. Hesco cannot find where the price for these days were 
recorded.  Per Hesco they  were underpaid by $32,101.57.  Hesco is wanting to

Sandi, 

The exisiting contracts on Lone Star are sufficient to cover deliveries to 
the plant (95,000 Mmbtu maximum daily quantity).  In the event that we have 
to transport excess gas to alternate locations, we will be using an ENA 
transport agreement and charging the expense back to Tenaska IV.

Daren,
Will there ever be a need to utilize transport to get supply to the plant 
other than through the 2 Lone Star agreements? If so, would we be using 
Tenaska transport agreements or ENA?

The deals you listed are transpurt usage tickets that we use to estimate the

Daren,

Is Fred's below concern something that you might be able to help us with?  I 
was thinking that (maybe) the volumes from this meter might belong to HPL.  
This is one of the meters that no longer go thru King Ranch.

Thanks

Jackie:

Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract 
012-41970-02-002 in March 2000.  Also last month when you were out, Robert 
removed the volume from the Liquids contract at this meter and temporarily 
put it on a Strangers Gas contract.  If you could fix both months today and 
let me know when it is corrected  I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Fred

I am new at the 3 Rivers allocation so bear with me, I took this over from 
Anita Luong.  In January 2000, and going forward, please make sure that 
Meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the HPL Liquids contract 
012-41970-02-002.  The contract is currently out of balance by the total 
volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning 
I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Daren,

I believe the best way to enter the fee into Sitara would be as a Demand fee 
in your example #1. 
If we do the fee this way, we will not  double up the volumes.

I have attached my spreadsheet for support:
THE MOST CURRENT WORKSHEET IS TAB #2 MARKED FINAL


Column G is the Over-Delivery quantity total is 17,278 mmbtus
Column S is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due HPLC  
$1,008.87 
Column T is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due the 
customer $519.73.

Katherine, 

There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into Sitara:
1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.

2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.  I 
can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara.

Let me know how you want to handle it.

This is to confirm that we need to take our delivery to HPL meter # 1428 to 
zero !!

Beaumont Methanol started a controlled shut-down last night (they will be 
down in Dec00 due to high gas prices) .... and it became an "out-of-control" 
shut in and they had to shut down last night, and are now taking no gas from

Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in

You need to speak with Reps from Exxon and Highland.  Ask them about their 
Lone Star transport allocation.  They had to transport the gas on Lone Star 
to sell to us.  So, Lone Star should have given them an allocation on their 
transport deliveries at that point (or their supplier's contracts) to match 
the sale volume.  Adjust our purchase amount from each party based on the 
transport allocation.

Subject: TXU Lone Star

I am working on clearing an old TXU Lone Star/Gas Distribution balance from 
8/99 and 9/99.  We originally billed TXU on nominated quantities and they 
have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments.  These are brokered deals where 
we sold to TXU and purchased from ExxonMobil and Highland.  TXU has provided 
meter support since the deals were on Lone Star pipeline, however, I am 
unsure how to have Volume Management reallocate.  

For example, we originally sold 10,000 mmbtu on 8/3/99 to TXU and purchased 
1,200 mmbtu from Highland Energy and 8,800 mmbtu from ExxonMobil.  TXU shows 
the total amount of gas on 8/3/99 was 9,240 mmbtu.  How should the purchase 
piece be allocated between ExxonMobil and Highland since this was a brokered 
deal?

August 1999:

Sale
TXU Electric & Gas  deals# 104975, 104256, 104738
Lone Star Gas Co. deal# 101985
Purchase
ExxonMobil Corp. deal#101522
Highland Energy Co. deal#101530

September 1999:

Sale
TXU Electric & Gas deal#109046
Purchase
ExxonMobil Corp. deals#101522, 108564
Highland Energy Co. deals#101530, 108146


Please let me know if I need to speak with someone else about this.  Thanks

McClendon is out of the office, Carey Metz is trading basis for him.  Because 
Carey is doing that, Stacey is needed to trade Waha.  And she is my backup on

I created deal #439909 for August.

Jeff - I am assuming that the price for August is Gas Daily.  Currently, we 
have the September deal priced at Gas Daily also.  Since this was flowing on 
the first, should the price be at Inside Ferc HSC for September?

Subject: Gorons

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-


What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a "cushy"  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "invent the
Internet" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, "Love Story" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton "one of
the greatest Presidents of our history."

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

Daren,

I'm attempting to clean up my allocations, due to this being allocation close 
week for Volume Management.

98-1534 (delivery meter) overflowed into March, day 1 only,  for .30 
decatherms (Sitara Deal #163005 - Start date 2/1/2000  and stop daate 
2/29/2000).  The 215K is the only one at this meter for Feb. 2000 
production.  I don't see a new Sitara deal number being referenced nor do I 
see the evergreen flag applied here.  Please apprise if you can extend the 
ticket for this small amount for 3/1/2000 or if you want it handled 
differently.  

98-1052 (delivery meter), allocated flow for 2/21-2/24/2000 with no K 
applied.    Days 22 and 23 for February references the 215K (Sitara Deal 
#168884 start date 2/22/2000 stop date 2/23/2000.  Sitara deal #201636 has 
the same start and stop date as 168884 and neither references an evergreen 
flag or a new deal number).  

Thanks

Sitara #139066 has a max of 9500 in the flex nom.  Is this correct?  Should 
the additional 1500 be on a swing ticket or included on the index ticket?

Another national crown ... It must be nice.  We have to keep referring back 
to our one and only in 1935.  But, we will never forget it!  I am looking 
forward to the 28th.  Tonya and I are going to the Aggie/K-state game.  We'll 
see how that goes.  Looks like your corn boys will be playing OU that 
weekend.  That should be a good battle.  OU also has a week off to get ready 
for you.  (I think they should be rated #2).

Things are going ok here.  I can't remember if we've talked about the sale of 
HPL.  That is getting closer to happening.  I am hoping it does.  I'm ready 
to go on to something else, and that would make it much easier.  Ami Chokshi 
decided that she would leave the co. this week.  She is heading of to San 
Fran.  No job or any specific plans yet, but it's always something whe has 
wanted to do.  It would be nice to be able to pick up and do something like 
that.

How's everything else going for you and the family.  We are all doing pretty 
good.  I actually took last week off.  The only plans I had were to spend 
time with the family.  It was great!  It really drove the point home that I 
need to stop letting people/things around here set my proiorities.

Anyway, would you be able to come down for lunch on Friday?  I'm sure it's 
been a while since you've had your Treebeard's.  Let me know.  Sorry I 
haven't talked to you much.  I'm going to end up losing all my friends if I 
don't change my ways.

Meter 5192.  I never heard back from Aimee on which Transport contract to 
attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still 
allocated to the Strangers Gas contract.  Aimee is out on vacation until 
mid-June so I put in a call to Daren Farmer to find out which Transport 
contract I should attach the deal 269123 to.

When I find out which transport contract to use I will set up the accounting 
arrangements and then get Robert Lloyd to put the contract in POPS and 
reallocate.

Please plan on attending a training session over lunch on Tuesday, Feb 15th.  
(Lunch will be provided.)  I intend to discuss the operations of Houston Pipe 
Line;  how gas is moved through the system, where our main supply and market 
areas are, locations of specific points, etc.  We will be using a map of the 
pipeline as the basis for the discussion.  So, come to the meeting with any 
questions you have on HPL, anything is fair game.

Yvette is currently working on securing a room.  I will let you know when 
that is finalized.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

For faster viewing, I would suggest you go to the first page of pictures and
click the "Small Slideshow" link. This will bring down all the photos at
once, and will cycle through all of them four times in a slideshow. Please
note that it might take some time to download all the pictures, depending
upon the speed of your connection to the Internet.

After the slideshow starts, all of the regular-sized pictures on the other
pages will temporarily be on your PC, which should make clicking through
each page a little faster.

If you run into problems viewing any of the pages/pictures, please drop me a
note.

Tonya/Daren: You will probably be more interested in the pictures on pages 5
and 6, which is also the fifth and sixth rows of the index page.

Thanks,

-Ram.

TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and 
$0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please 
change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.

Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They 
have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El 
Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has 
the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called 
"Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is 
$0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.

Thanks,
Megan

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 
2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting 
spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353  Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258  Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11



I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser 
ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we 
do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that 
only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just 
going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so 
you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

Hi Daren,

Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters 
can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so 
that Anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me?

98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the deal 
is not effective until  February the 11th.
     No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the 
gathering (96026573) K which is the only
     K @ the meter.

98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is 
flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/2000 
production which is the only K @ the meter.


Thanks

Daren,

The above meter recorded a flow on Jan 15 this year.  It has not had any 
activity all the way back through 1999.  I checked with Cheryl Jones and the 
flow is good.  It was apparently turned on for that one day.  Do we need to 
put in a deal for this flow?  

Thanks.

Also, we had a transport nom from Texaco into King Ranch, so we will have 
adequate flow into Stratton.

You need to get with the East desk on this.  Were they allocated this volume 
on Tetco?  If so, you can adjust the deal and have the East desk approve it.  
If they were not allocated this flow, the volume should go on the OBA.

Christy, I think there is a good chance that the information shown below
went to you, or your office.

I would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution
for the N. Padre production.  I am certain you are way ahead of me on this
matter.  Spinnaker expects a Division Order Title Opining within a few
weeks.  I also expect the attorney to make some title requirements which
will delay a final Opinion.  In talking with Ranger and The Houston
Exploration Company, they are prepared to receive their gross (shown below)
and be responsible to their respective ORRI owners.

How do you recommend we proceed?  Will HPL pay taxes on behalf of the
parties?

When you get a minute, please call me at 713/759-1770.

Thanks,

Dan McCue

Daren,

I believe the best way to enter the fee into Sitara would be as a Demand fee 
in your example #1. 
If we do the fee this way, we will not  double up the volumes.

I have attached my spreadsheet for support:
THE MOST CURRENT WORKSHEET IS TAB #2 MARKED FINAL


Column G is the Over-Delivery quantity total is 17,278 mmbtus
Column S is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due HPLC  
$1,008.87 
Column T is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due the 
customer $519.73.

There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into Sitara:
1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.

2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.  I 
can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara.

The Methanol Plant is still on target to begin making spec methanol on 
Friday, July 28.   The plant may start taking some natural gas late Tuesday, 
July 25.  

Because of dredging at the Oxy dock, no barges can be loaded July 31 to 
August 3.

Subject: Basin Production from GA 213

I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin production 
from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the 
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect 
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best 
sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve 
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows 
stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this 
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close 
watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for 
liquids fallout.

Daren,

 I apoligize for the late notice.  I didn't realize that we would need your 
help until this morning.  Please let me know the time that is convenient for 
you (tomorrow ?) and I will schedule another meeting.  We need to discuss the 
purchase deals on MidTex Pipeline, at meters 0393 and 0391 (HPL's meter#s).  
The first deal is with Etoco, original deal 44829 (12/98-12/99), which has 
been moved to 133435 for Jan 2000 and going forward.  The second meter has 
desk-to desk deals starting Jan 99 to present.  These deals need to be 
scheduled on MidTex meters instead of HPL's meters.

I have created deal 244531 to cover this flow.

Julie - This is actually volume related to the term deal 93804.  Volume 
flowed in March due to timing on changing the meter.  Can you attach the term 
contract to this deal?  (I copied the term deal to create the March ticket.)

Subject: EOL killed deals

Over the past several weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of 
"killed" or modified EOL transactions.   Please remind each of your 
respective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer "clicks" on a 
deal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we 
can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark 
Taylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a 
termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We 
(Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to 
change an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824), 
Frank Davis (x37235), or Dale Neuner (39746). 

Call me if you have any questions.

Megan, 

I have changed the pricing on deals 452491 and 452475 for October flows to 
mtr 25000200.  These flows should be priced at $.10 + 1/2 % fuel.  The $.11 
that Lone Star billed us is incorrect on the last deal.  I'm not sure about 
the rates for mtr 20014903.  The person who can tell us should be in 
tomorrow.  I will leave a note for her.  We should have similar deal tickets 
for Dec forward.  I will check with Mark and Trisha.

Have you been able to work out these transport pricing differences for Oct. 
2000?  We have only been able to pay $4,000.00 of the $28,000.00 invoice.  
The pricing for Nov. 2000 (deal 452491) has problems too.  We have $0.01 for 
11/3 at meter 20014804 and TXU is billing us $0.10 at meter 25000200 and 
$0.02 at meter 20014903 for the entire month.

I have also noticed that we are not accruing any transport for Dec 2000 
forward.  We have received the Dec. 2000 invoice from TXU, but we do not have 
a deal to pay them.  We should be getting Jan. 2001 next week.  Is there a 
deal for these months?

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Thanks,

Tom Engel (Sitara) has moved the big Entex ticket (#117413) for July 2000 
forward to deal #292249.  This should help some with amount of time it takes 
to update and bridge back this deal.  He is adjusting the swap tickets also.  
You should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok.  

The programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time 
involved in updating the deal.

Changing counterparty names on Sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact 
to any downstream processes.  

I hope the following will give more clarification.   

Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! 

Thanks,
dg  3-9517


Sitara / Unify - Process
* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had 
been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify.
* Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely 
harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* Process - 
Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   
Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.  
The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.
Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)
Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now 
highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high 
level, not on path)
The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path
If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path

Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all 
information is correct)
Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.  
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match 
up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in Unify.  
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which 
would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.
(note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)


Autonoms "Tom's words of warning" - 
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after 
deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI 
path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already 
nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the 
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct 
the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to 
manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify 
(as explained above).


(Dave - feel free to chime in if I left anything out.)

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)  

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

and I don't have another trader's name.  Could you please talk to your KN 
trader regarding this situation?  If Midcon really got this gas, then someone 
at KN should tell their accountant about the deal.

Any sales made to MGI off of HGPL or HPL should be billed by the Texas Desk.  
However, HPL will not invoice MGI.  All trades are done under ENA.

Elsa,

I was informed to bill anything on HGPL by my supervisor, but when I talk to 
Priscilla Hamic she informed me that HGPL should be billed by offsystem and 
not the Texas desk.  The deals in Sitara that relate to HGPL all state that 
it is Texas desk.

Please let me know who should be billing MGI Supply for HGPL volume.

Thanks for your help.

I expect the wellhead volumes to be around 625,000 to 650,00 per day.

Subject: Gathering Contract Volumes Feb 00

We have been looking at the daily volumes for the gathering contract to 
analyze the Producer Services portion of the P&L.  To do this, we have been 
looking at daily volumes on the 96026572 contract.  POPS shows a daily BAV of 
approximately 612,000.  MOPS shows a daily BAV of approximately 601,000.  I 
wanted to confirm that these volumes sound reasonable for you.  By the way, 
it also looks like the noms for the gathering contract are a lot higher, 
around 750,000 per day.

Please advise as to how you feel these BAv's come in compared to what you 
expect.  Thank you.


Heidi

Gary, 

The deal with Williams Terminals expired in Oct.  However, about 3,800 flowed 
for Nov.  Do you need to renegotiate this deal for Nov.  Or, do we roll it 
under the terminated k?  What do think about Dec?

You can roll this if you need to.  I usually leave it up to logistics to 
update the trans usage tickets like this.

The deal in sitara indicates that the price for East Texas Gas Systems is  
HSC, Index -$.085.
Per the contract, the redelivery  at ETGS Carthage Hub Tailgate should be 
priced at  HSC Index -$.0825.  
Are these the same points and is the price correct?

The message below was sent Friday afternoon and came back with an incorrect 
address. Merry gave me the corrected e-mail address shown above.

New developments. Merry and the baby went home this afternoon and he has now 
been named. He is Brandon Aaron Byington

Hi there, Darren & Tonya,

Merry and Doc had their new baby at 9:26 AM yesterday. No name yet. They are 
still trying to settle on one, so in the mean time, I'm just calling him "New 
Child" Byington.

He weighed 7 lbs 2 oz and was 19 1/4" long. Merry, Doc, and "New Child" are 
doing fine. Doc was in there during the whole delivery (C section) so he says 
he was a bit shakey there a time or two.

Here are some digital camera pics I took when "N. C." was less thasn an hour 
old.

We do not have a demand fee for the Feb 2001 Tenaska IV sale, deal 384258.  
Can you please put this in so I can bill?  From your spreadsheet, it looks 
like it needs to be $2,291,888.83, but you can verify.  I subtracted the 
agency fee from the Tenaska IV receipt number, since we already have that 
booked.

Hey, Mom.  I got your message.  Just send the curtains whenever you get the 
chance.  Jo went to the doctor yesterday and everything is looking good.  She 
is going to start going to the doctor weekly.  Carrying the baby pretty low, 
so he's getting ready.  Jo thinks he'll be coming around the first part of 
March, the doctor didn't say that, though.  Anyway, tell Lacy "Good Luck".  I 
love ya'll.

Wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might 
involve your desks via EOL in the near future. We already have one in the 
East.  I stressed to the Sitara/EOL folks the importance of adding comments 
to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is 
happening.  One side of these buy/sell or exchange deals will be ratable and 
the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality.Comments will 
include the corresponding deal number, that it is in fact a buy/sell or 
exchange deal and the delivery time period(3,5 or 10 days) that the 
counterparty desires.
I hope this helps...THANKS!

Got any ideas on how this transaction should look.  This looks like a monthly 
volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once 
the counterparty has made their decision  (I would imagine logistics will be 
the one communicating with the counterparty).  We probably need EOL to 
indicate whether it is a 3, 5, 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this 
as comments.

Linda/Karen -what are your thoughts on how separate GTC would work on this.

If we could all do a little homework.  I will get something scheduled for 
next week to discuss further.

We are positioning ourselves to release a new Product Type that we will refer 
to as a Flexible Physical Gas product. Legal is in the process of drafting a 
GTC and Product Type description that will be used with this Product Type. I 
will start the building process once Legal provides the GTC and Product Type 
description; but in the interim, here's a broadstroke description of how the 
transaction works:

Party A and Party B exchange gas during the month of June 2000.

Party A buys 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool Index

Party B has the right to notify Party A of when Party B wants to take 
delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three 
forms: 3-day delivery, 5-day delivery, or 10-day delivery. The gas nominated 
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu (i.e.; If 
Party B chooses 5 days for nomination, Party A would deliver 20% of the 
300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%).  Party B pay 
TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.

I understand that this type of transaction is currently done 
over-the-counter. Scott Mills has previously issued an explanatory e-mail of 
Sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues.

Bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a Sigma Factor in advance, then 
my turn around time to for the Product Type should be reduced. Also, due to 
the varying 'optionality', do you think these three different products will 
require three different Product Types?

Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

I show that we adjusted pricing for excess volumes for the following dates:


Mar 11-31    15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .045


April 5-19 15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .055.  An 
outage occurred on the 5th, so the deliveries to Mobil didn't acutally start 
until the   12th.

If you need anything else, let me know.

Shoreline wants to increase the volume at  meter 9830 for the 10th gas day.  
This is a new meter so there is not much history to it.  They want to go from 
535 to 750.  last month it flowed in the upper 500's  but it didn't come on 
till the 21st of the month.

I am trying to forward this money to Tenaska tomorrow, so if you could change 
this before 8:00am tomorrow, I'd appreciate it.

We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I 
am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand 
fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand 
fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to 
the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.

Megan

For October, Tenaska IV should be paying us.  We bought gas from Apache and 
Williams on Lone Star Pipeline.  We sold that gas to Tenaska IV when the 
Cleburne plant was operating.  On days the plant was not operating, we sold 
that gas to other counterparties (the sales on Lone Star you see for ENA).  
For September, we may need to pay them an amount, but I need to check into 
that.  With the way this deal has been in the structuring process over a 
couple of months, there are some questions on how to handle Sep.  I'll let 
you know what I determine about Sep.

Daren:
Can you shed a little light on this Tenaska IV deal?  James Armstrong is 
telling me that we should have a purchase deal in the system to pay Tenaska 
IV for the 9/00 and 10/00 gas that we are marketing for them.  I do not see a 
deal in Path Manager for either month.  I also need some detail on who we are 
buying and selling this gas from and to.  There are a number of 
counterparties at Lonestar for ENA and I'm not sure which ones go with this 
deal.  Is there a schedule you can email to me?  James is looking for an 
answer today on the Tenaska IV payment, so whatever you can tell me will be 
appreciated.

Thanks,
Megan

Deal # 157288
Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal 
from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.  
Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in 
Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract 
the price for this redelivery point. 

Thanks

Could you please correct the deal below.  Whenever you book a deal with PG&E 
we have to be careful as to which one.  DO NOT assume that is will be PG&E 
Energy Trading-Gas Corp.  More times than not, it is PG&E Texas Industrial

I received a call from Jill Zively about our supply at mtr 5999.  Late Friday 
night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into Midcon instead of 
HPL.  The nomination into HPL for the 10th through the rest of the month will 
be 11,300/d.  Jill knew this would be happening, so they priced the deal at 
Gas Daily.  I changed deal #278748 to reflect this change for Saturday 
forward.  Since this is priced at Gas Daily, there will be no mark-to-market 
impact.  We need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume 
changed and adjust if necessary.

BH,

I plan to be on vacation July 5-6 (finally) and on the customer trip on the 
7th.  While I am out, Gary Hanks will be keeping our position during 
trading.  Stacey will be in charge of everything else.  I am comfortable that 
everything will be covered.  

I will be back in town Thursday night.  The primary flight for the customer 
trip leaves around 11:30.  Others leave at 3:30 and 5:30(?).   The latest 
idea we had is that Pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will 
take a later flight on the August trip, allowing one of us to be in the 
office for half the day.  I can also come in for the half day on the 7th if 
we decide that is needed.

Per gas control, Shell has requested that we lower meter 1581 by 5M and 
increase 1095 by 5M; net effect is zero.  Please let me know if the deal 
needs to be adjusted to reflect the change.

Daren,
I'm not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me.  If you 
are not, could you please let me know who I need to speak to.
For meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3/00 production forward, this deal is set 
up under the wrong Sitara #, therefore the volumes are not pulling in Sitara.
  The sitara # that it is currently attached to is # 149421 which this deal 
was only for 1/00 production.  The new Sitara number that we should be using 
is
Sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and Sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032 
).  I have attached an example  to help see what I am talking about.
( this was for 2/00 production )
Could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is 
something that I need to do.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Could you add meter PGE-LS 491-754 to TXU Fuel deal #108672 for May 12, 2000 
in Sitara?  TXU received 2,000 mmbtu on that day as part of the Gas Daily 
contract, however, the volume is pathed under the Wagner Brown contract due 
to the meter.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

Lee, 

On deal 413447 (Chevron @ Olefins), we have a flex nom of 6,000 to 
12,000/day.  Is this a monthly nom or daily nom?  Will we have a swing deal 
with them for the winter?  The current swing deal is for Oct only.  For Oct, 
they have pulled an average of 16,000/day.

The purchase from Swift was shown at mtr 3405 during Dec and Jan.  I have 
created a new deal (#204777) to add mtr 9643 to the deal.

Deal 114096 is the purchase from HPLR Liquids.  This purchase is on 138544 
for Jan 2000 forward.

another deal to replace deal #114096 of should this deal be extended into

Stella:

The Swift deal is not pathed correctly in POPS.  I set up an accounting 
arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would 
you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID?  

The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement 
gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it 
either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the 
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up 
an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number 
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set 
up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you 
can put the contract at meter 9643.

Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.

Thanks,

Fred

Hey Ken.

How are things going for you?  Is the market loving you?

We have been really busy.  We sold our house after 2 weeks on the market.  I 
don't think I had it underpriced.  I looked at the average $/sq ft for sales 
in our neighborhood for the last 6 months and I was pretty high above the 
average.  Anyway, we got what we wanted and made a little money, so we were 
happy.  Two days after we sold our house, Tonya found the one she wanted in 
Oaks of Devonshire.  It's over at Louetta and I-45, just before The Thicket.  
It's a little bigger than we were looking for (3100 sq ft), but it's got a 
great game room/sunroom for the kids.  It was built in 86, so it needs a 
little work.  But that's ok with me.  Anyway, we are closing on both houses 
on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday.  We will have you and Linda over 
for lunch or dinner one of these days.  We also had tubes put into Jake's 
ears this month.  We hated having to do that, but it has really made a 
difference.  He had a constant ear infection since October.  Now you can tell 
that he feels so much better.  He's learning more and more each day.  We have 
nothing that is "Jake proof".  Even those plastic locks you put on cabinets 
don't hold him.  He knows that if you keep yanking on the door over and over 
that it will eventually slip or break and then your in.  I'm going to install 
pad locks on the cabinets at the new house.  We'll see if that stops him.  
Anyway, everybody's doing well.  I will be alot better after we finish this 
house business.  I don't feel so good when I'm writing all those checks.  
Talk to you later.

Here are the issues for HL&P for 11/99:

The shortage at San Jac meter 1554 (the 95%) cannot be made up at 7268 
because not enough flow at the meters.  What can we do?  Buyback?
Adonis has nom of 10000mmbtu on day 4, should this be kept whole?   If so, 
how?  Day 4 flowed of 153mmbtu at the aggregate meter.

Please advice.  

Thanks

We will need to wait until Janet gets back.  This is a spot deal that was 
done by Gary Lamphier.  Did Janet negotiate something with them after the

For Company 12 could you please put in a buy-back for Reliant Energy HL&P on 
Contract # 96022113 for the volume of 1,286 Mmbtu's on 12/27/2000.  The

The sale counter-part to this purchase should go to deal # 529159.

economy.  Over the past 75 years, we have expanded our physical network 
across the Texas Gulf Coast, and we now offer a wide range of financial, 
commodity and risk management services.    HPL is the largest single supplier 
of gas to Entex and is one of the most flexible intrastate pipeline systems 
in the country due to our 118 Bcf Bammel Storage field.

To celebrate our 75th birthday, I am pleased to invite HPL employees and 
their spouse or guest to a company-sponsored event on Saturday the 9th of 
September at Moody Gardens in Galveston, Texas.  The attached invitation 
provides the details.  Additional information will be sent to you over the

Please see the attached Tufco file for July.  The 2,500 under the Wagner 
Brown contract on the 24th has been zeroed out (no flow at LS Katy for that 
day).  This resulted in a change between contracts/deals on the 31st also.  
Let me know if you have any questions.

For Mobil in March, beginning on March 21, HPL started delivering 30,000/d 
for MidCon (just like we did in Dec and Jan, and maybe in Feb too)

Check with Daren Farmer when you get ready to do the flash invoice on the 
first to confirm the MidCon volume amounts and dates

Daren , I think I may have lost my mind ( no comment Vance) but did I talk to 
you about meter 6789 taking that volume from 12079 to 1200.  Also Yates has 
averaged around the 3366 that they want to bring the volume down to. Let me 
know what you think.  Husker TOM.

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Thanks,

Bob, 

Go ahead and accept the nom revision.  I believe that this is with PGE, not 
El Paso.  How do the rest of our noms compare with EOG?  I f they have a 
higher volume at another meter than we do, I would like to increase our nom 
there.  In effect, I want to keep our physical index position as close as 
possible to what we have in the system now.

nomination as follows:

EOG Res. 6296  5,733  2,300

Will you approve revising the volume in Unify down to 2,300?  Please advise.

Deal 135714 is active through Oct 2000.  The volume on the ticket is zero, so 
the nom was probably never sent to POPS.

Daren:

During the period of 9/1/2000 through 9/13/2000, the above meter has recorded 
flow on the following days:

 Days     Mmbtus

 9/1/2000            4,873
 9/2/2000            4,968
 9/3/2000            4,970

 9/5/2000            5,039
 9/6/2000            4,971
 9/7/2000            4,971
 9/8/2000            1,419
 9/13/2000                  58

            36,085

Deal #135714 was at this meter, but the contract tied to this deal expired at 
the end of August 2000.   Currently, these volumes are being booked to the 
HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics need either (1) Purchase Contract 
#96008903 tied to Deal #135714 extended, (2) new deal & contract, or (3) 
approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, 
sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).

Daran,  We have a few volume changes for the 1st of March,  first EOG has 
changed there volume for the gas at meter 6296 from 11,036 to 7100.  I  ran 
into Laurie Allen in the hall and she said we were heavy there and  that she 
would visit with you abut it.   The second one is Cokinos, they  will not 
confirm the volume at meter 9656.  We have 922 and they want that they want 
950.  I looked up there nom and that is what they asked for.  Not much of a 
change.  Last is the one that you faxed down to me this mornings.  Basin 
Exploration wants to drop there nom due to well problems from 896 to 1.  for 
the whole month.  Let me know what you think and I'LL get after it.  Tom Cat

Mary, 

Please get with some one in measurement to check the flows at the meter.  I 
am thinking that the measurement must be incorrect. In POPS, the estimates vs 
acutals look odd.  The gas that was coming to us in June, is going to Koch in 
July, so we should not be receiving anything.

We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at 
mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any 
days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any 
shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

 Sitara #256686, PGEV Valero (?)

Daren,

I left you a message regarding this matter 2 days ago.  Was wondering if you 
had time to look into this.

Conoco is saying that we are missing one day of sale to them:  5/5  10,000 
mmbtu at 2.95, deal #256686.

I am not seeing this in Sitara.  Could you please confirm?  

Customer has already called twice asking us to invoice them for this.

Thanks for your help on this.

Steve, 

I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 
2000.  Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.  But since 
our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where 
HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.  ENA then transports the 
gas to a delivery point.  If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an 
additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery 
point.  This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and 
completing the scheduling in reasonable time.  Plus, it just doesn't make 
sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as 
HPLC.  Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.

Thanks for your help.

Steve, 

How are things going with this request?

FYI.  The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.  Only 
sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA.

Please forward this to whoever in the Pipeline group does transport,

things off Oasis are ENA and will continue to be.

Dan, 

ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines 
(listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the 
majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to 
HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process 
used to accomlish this?  We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.

Thanks.

Pat, 

This is the Texaco Fee CP, it flowed a total of 1,517 from Dec 99 to Apr 2 
2000.  There is a Strangers Agmt. set up to take allocations, however, this 
must be a wellhead related pt. that has declined.  How do I go about finding 
out who this belongs to?  I thought about ringing Texaco, but, wanted to 
check before I made any calls.

If you are no longer handling this meter, please pass this email on to the 
correct person.

For meter # 6563, I have meter statements showing that volume did flow for 
12/99 - 4/00 production on this meter.  I am not seeing this volume in volume 
management for these production months.  For 5/00 and 6/00 production, the 
volumes are there.  Is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up?
Please let me know.  

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  PG&E did not fully process the 
gas stream at their Indian Springs plant on December 12 and 13 and took the 
reduced shrinkage, 19.000 MMBtu/d, and sold it to HPL at Gas Daily -$0.04.  
PG&E did not have the right to do that, so they are going to allocate that 
volume to Comstock, from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month 
index.  At the same time PG&E will create an imbalance, for which they will 
pay HPL the same amount HPL paid them for the gas for those two days.  This 
should wash the sale at Gas Daily and leave HPL buying the gas at the 
beginning of the month IFHSC ( the price in the Comstock purchase contract) 
and selling it at the Gas Daily price for 12/12 and 12/13.  The paperwork is 
on its way to me to close this issue out.

Ed,

Sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal I have attached below.  
Apparently we bot from PGE Industrial on the 12th and 13th.  PG&E has 
allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to TECO, and claim that they are 
net deals.  I do not show a sale in the system at the meter, and I checked 
the 215 K for those days for a corresponding delivery to TECO, perhaps at 
another meter, and could not find one.  

Any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated.

Mary

I can not believe you are sending emails form Hawaii!!!!  You are crazy.  I 
took care of Camden for the month-
It is now 330 and Hilcorp has not responded.  I spoke with Jerry Bubert 
several times today- emailed Mike LAnnou and left messages, and had him 
paged, and copied Hildebrand (the president).  If we don't hear by 4pm, we 
are supposed to bypass the gas...........

Robert, 

There are three buy back tickets in Sitara for Equistar at mtr 1373.  Two for 
HPL and one under ENA.  Shouldn't we have only one buyback for each company?  
Also, how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ENA contract 
and HPL contract?

Done.

FYI.  Due to scheduling concerns and contract language, I changed the 
delivery point on this deal to Eastrans pipeline, instead of HPL.  This 
should clean up the allocations for this area.  Also, beginning on Nov 15th, 
we cut the swap to zero, and I purchased the gas at Cotton Valley under a 
spot agreement (#484935).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Rob, 

I got your name from Doug Leach.  He  thought that you would be the person to 
talk to about this.

I got a call last night from Rudolph Maldonado.  (The operator forwarded him 
our way.)  He stated that he has some natural gas to sell in Saudi Arabia.  
His number is 562-866-1755.  Could you give him a call and check this out?  I 
told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.

I can be reached at 3-6905 if you have any questions.

I noticed the new October deals for Valero (414065, 414074, 414071) include 
both the base Index pricing and the swing Gas Daily pricing.  However, the 
old swing deals (148386, 148391, 148382) are still valid through October.   
Should these deals be effective for October?

Thanks for your help.

Daren---

I need some help with meter 5892 for September 00 due to a feedback error.  
Deal 133196 (purchase from Duke on gathering contract) is erroring out due to 
it's expiration date of 8/31/00......however it still showed up in POPS (w/o 
a nom) on 9/1.  Volume management allocated volume to it according to the 
allocation statement.  Should this deal be extended?  I noticed it is not out 
there for October either.  I have the feedback error sheet & allocation if 
you want to see them.

Let me know,

Mark

p.s. Fred Boas said you used to handle this and you were very wise in the art 
of allocation......so I am expecting big results Grasshopper!

Dan, 

ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines 
(listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the 
majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to 
HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process 
used to accomlish this?  We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.

Thanks.

Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I 
checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate 
of 7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked 
OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does 
seem strange that this is the only month of flow.

Thanks, Stella

Subject: Amoco Energy 2/00

We have a purchase deal in the system, 205116, for Feb. 2000 production that 
Amoco does not show.  Can you tell me the trader's name at Amoco that the 
deal was done with?

Subject: March Surveys

Hello,

We have prepared January and February data and will be scheduling meetings 
with you in the next few weeks.  For the month of March, please provide a 
completed "Hours" survey for each position within your group.  This survey 
will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the 
month of March.   

NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time 
directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you 
can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can 
add the appropriate activities to your survey.

To fill out the survey:

At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled "Select Your RC".  
Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.
Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message "Select 
Position from Drop Box!" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, 
specialist, etc.) and "OK". The choices for positions are based on 
information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed 
that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that 
corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of 
activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity 
listed in the column labelled "Hours".
If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the 
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.  
If you do not, the information will be lost.

We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two 
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the "Last Month" 
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you 
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send 
this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill 
out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you 
perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible 
for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.

Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If this is a 
problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.

Thanks,
Shari

BH, 

Sorry I didn't get these to you last night.  I left the office sooner than 
planned.  This list is pretty slim.  I spent much time trying to learn to 
trade Waha, which took a considerable amount of time away from producing 
reults for you.  With me now concentrating on operations and with the plan to 
hire an additional person, this will change.  Let me know if you have any 
questions on my list of accomplishments.

Please see the attachment.  This file shows deals that still need adjustment 
stemming from the base gas program being kicked off for Dec.  Please have 
these corrected also.  Thanks.

The "arranged_quantity" column contains the correct volume.

Subject: Meter #1591 Lamay Gaslift

Daren - Meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom.  This meter is has been 
over nominated.  It has had a nom of 1.000/day (429.000 total mmbtus) since 
1/28/99 and has flowed only 11.692.  Am I correct to say that this meter 
needs a lower nom?  Please let me know if I should look out for a lower nom 
in May.  Pat seems to think this may be affecting the P/L for April.  We only 
have estimates/actuals of zero on 4/1 & 4/2.  

Please let me know if this makes sense.

Please check meter #1591 Lamay gas lift.  It doesn't appear to have very much 
flow and the
BAV is showing the nom volume.  This could be adversely affecting the risk 
numbers.  Pat

some spot deals included in the exchange deals.  The volumes have now been 
moved to the correct deals and the demand charges need to be corrected.  I 
have listed the changes below.  Let me know if you would like to see the 
spreadsheets.

Deal 157278
3/00 Add demand charge of $73,403.47 for excess charge
4/00 Change demand fee from $1,507.56 to $1,966.93
6/00 Change demand fee from $1,129.99 to $359.97

10,000 should be allocated to Adonis #51862 on the 5th only.  Nothing should 
be allocated or confirmed for Adonis on the 16th.  Additionally, it looks 
like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from Mitchell (Track ID 3167) on the 
16th.  This should be -0- also.  By taking the conf/allocation for Adonis 
(Track ID 6155) and Mitchell (Track ID 3167) to zero on the 16th, the meter 
balance remains the same and the bridge errors will be cleared.

On day 5 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is a delivery nom of 10.0 pathed to the ENA 
201 K.  On day 16 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is not a deal (which is strange 
because day 16 in POPS references Adonis).  The deal on the 5th was a swing 
deal.

Jackie, 

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add 
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was 
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in 
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I 
checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate 
of 7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked 
OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does 
seem strange that this is the only month of flow.

Thanks, Stella

Daren, I am trying to process two invoices from Samson Resources Co. (Samson 
Lone Star Limited) for September 2000 and October 2000.  The volume is at 
Carthage Hub.  I have not been able to find this volume in Unify for either 
month.  Samson has faxed me their confirmation and your name is listed as the 
contact.  Do you know the Sitara number for these deals?  Thanks.

Daren,

Wanted to let you know that there are still two sitara deals that need to 
have the expected volume brought down to "0" of the list that I previously 
sent you.
They are 114099 and 92918.

I appreciate you revising the ones that you have and you probably were going 
to handle the above two today.  In case you were please disregard this 
notice.  If you had fogotten, this can serve as reminder.

As usual, thanks for your help.

Mike, 

What is the status of the list we compiled a few months ago?  I had a few 
items on that list, but I can't remember the details now.  Since I don't deal 
with Unify as much as I used to, the only thing that I can remember is:

We need to add a column with the initials of the schedulers responsible for 
each meter.

Ken, 
Thanks for your input.  I will definitely take this into consideration.

Also, I want you to know that I really do appreciate all that you've done for 
me.  I have greatly benefited from your knowledge of the market and industry; 
and also from your experience of just dealing with people and issues.  It has 
been very nice having someone to discuss ideas with and to learn from (and 
argue with!).  Thanks, also, for your honesty and openness.  I really 
appreciate you telling me when you disagree, it helps me see things from a 
different view.  (I just want to do the best thing for our business, and you 
help me to do that.)  You don't try to slip anything by, and you take 
responsibility for your work/actions.  That's hard to find these days.  I 
just wanted to let you know that.  Thanks.

But, I will still continue to think of you as in that Dilbert cartoon:  
"Whenever we disagree, I always end up yelling.  That's an indication that 
you have poor interpersonal skills."

I phoned Doug Trachta at Tejas regarding this issue.  I appears that 
nominations were made under ENA's agreement 6520 on Tejas Pipeline Company 
from Carthage to Indian Hills.  However, both of these points are actually on 
the Tejas Gas Operating.  ENA doesn't have an agreement to ship on Operating, 
but HPL does.   I think we need to set up an accounting arrangement to 
accomodate this deal, it appears as though ENA would be "piggy-backing" on 
HPL's agreement as they actually own the gas.  It appears as though we need 
to move the volumes from Pipeline to Operating, at the very least.  How have 
other months been handled with respect to this transport?

Please let me know if I may be of any further assistance in resolving this 
deal.

I have created a spreadsheet to assist in the tracking and booking of the gas 
supply related to Tenaska IV.  If you have suggestions or comments on the 
file, contact either me or Mark.

Megan - You can copy the Jan 01 Est tab and update the volumes with actuals.  
The file should calculate the resulting settlement with Tenaska.  I will then 
update the demand fee on the deal ticket to true-up the month.  Since we 
haven't gone through actuals in the spreadsheet, we may have to do some 
tweaking with the formulas.  Anyway, this should give us a good start and you 
will be able to see where we closed the month in Logisitics.

The file is located in O/Logistics/Cleburne Plant/2001FuelMgmt.xls.  If you 
don't have access, we can look into creating a new location on the O drive.  
The spreadsheet is attached for this month.  This is definitely a work in 
progress.  So, if you have ideas to make it easier, or if you need something 
added, let us know.

Hey, Ken.

Well, the folks are fine.  But, they have a few friends who lost just about 
everthing.  In fact, one family found only a couple of boxes of salvagable(?) 
items from their home (only one family picture) .  I understand that alot of 
homes were reduced to rubble with very little left to save.  It was very 
bad.  What made it worse was the freezing weather coming in.  When we talked 
to Tonya's parents, they were really in shock of bad it was.

 Have you been battling those Christmas mobs?  I took friday and Monday off 
and tried my luck at it.  I didn't last too long.  It doesn't seem right to 
be cussing everyone out at Christmas...I think I hate people now...I think 
I'm becoming a scrooge.   Well, I hope ya'll are doing good and staying in 
the Christmas mood.  Cole is excited about Christmas (wants more Hot Wheels 
and monster trucks).  Jake doesn't have the foggiest idea what's going on 
except that he wants to rip every ornament off of the tree and eat it.  We've 
told him "no" so much that he shakes his head back and forth and smiles while 
he's grabbing for one.  He is a handful.  Jake has also started taking 
steps.  He just turned 9 months old this month.  That's a little over a month 
earlier than Cole started taking steps.  

Anyway, I need to go.

We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at 
mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any 
days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any 
shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her 
I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like 
it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA 
deal whole.  What do you suggest?

Aimee,

This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep 
the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there 
last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there 
is another way.

let me know if we should be paying the swing parties(deal tickets117738 and

Aimee, 

If you review that deal in CPR, you can see that this is a desk to desk deal 
on ECT.  This is actually our transport of Waha gas on PGE, delivered into 
HPL.  So, the volume should be scheduled/allocated to the ECT intrastate 
contract 012-27049-201.

Subject: Unresolved Issues for Jan 1.- Followup

Here is a followup to the memo sent on 12/31/99.  FYI


Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we 
stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get 
this assigned?  I can find old
   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let 
me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?  We no longer do business on 
Enron Field Services.

Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for 
ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved  We should 
have a sale to Entex.   The deal will be enrtered in Sitara.

MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and 
Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with 
transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it 
stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I 
thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Unresolved  
We have a sale on ECT to Entex in Sitara.

Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:

 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left 
unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed 
appropriately.  Someone
  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, 
that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.

 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This 
issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot 
allocate was is
  not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?  Carlos is looking into 
this.

 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point 
specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 
10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the 
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this 
transaction, we are not legally covered.  Carlos was handling this pipe in 
Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved  Carlos nom'd this to 
Channel.  He knows the contract and rate (negotiated by Elsa).

HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December 
and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back 
next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return. 
I haven't had time to do this yet.  If we haven't figured out the assignement 
then I will get to it asap.

Team,

We are still waiting on the Agreements to be returned to us for the Camden 
Driscoll Ranch #3 Well.  We should receive them by Monday, December 4, 2000.  
I spoke with the field guy today (Bobby Husky) and he stated that the well 
would not be ready to turn on until 3 weeks from now.  He said that an amine 
plant is being installed.  Therefore, we are waiting on them.  This is just 
an FYI to everyone.    This will still be booked for December 2000.  Please 
forward this email to anyone that I might have left out.

Thank you!

John, 

I need information on the following questions related to Cornhusker:

1)  I understand that we will be handling the invoicing and settlements of 
the supply, transport, and sales contracts.  Who will be handling the 
financiol accounting  and reporting for these deals?

2)  Is someone in Legal currently assigning the contracts to ENA?

3)  What is the name of the company purchasing the supply/fuel at the plant?

4)  Tenaska told us that we are supposed to be paying the suppliers and the 
pipeline for July and August activity.  Is this true?  I thought we weren't 
taking responsibility for this until September business.  We are not prepared 
to pay the suppliers for July.

5)  Should these deals be in an accrual or MTM book?

Thanks.

Daren

Subject: May Activity Survey

Attached please find the Activity Survey for the month of May, 2000.

I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself 
to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll 
in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka 
Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of 
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the 
Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my 
observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of 
data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to 
get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with 
this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this 
month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for 
data quality and timeliness.

The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial 
teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the 
requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity 
driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of 
day Friday, June 2.

Please note the following updates:
For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the 
survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please 
provide statistics accordingly
If a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email 
Jennifer Reside
If you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction, 
please call or email Jennifer Reside

If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the 
surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.  This will 
eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like 
us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next 
month, please let Jennifer know.

Please contact Jennifer Reside x3-5971 with questions (Shari is on vacation 
this week), or if you are unable to complete the survey within the allotted 
time.

Daren,  Shore line would like to take meter 9781 from 460 to 1  for the 11 th 
gas day.  It flowed the nom for April so they must be having well problems 
this month.  Meter 9680 has a change from 739 to 1200.  It flowed in the 700 
for April .  Could be new production coming on behind the meter. 

Texaco would like to change meter 9826 from 1201 to 1500 for the rest of the 
month.  In April they flowed from 1000 to 1300.

Charlene, 

We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29-30th.  No price was 
negotiated that I can find. However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last 
price on the deal to cover those days.  What price is Hesco showing?

Meter 986725 for March 2000.   Per Hesco both traders are gone at (Hesco and 
Enron)  and they (Hesco) were not paid  the correct price  in March on the 
days mentioned below. Hesco cannot find where the price for these days were 
recorded.  Per Hesco they  were underpaid by $32,101.57.  Hesco is wanting to 
come to our office to have a meeting about clearing this up.  It will be nice 
if we don't have to meet with them.

If you need it, I've got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and 
fuel from each location (there numerous receipt points).  It is possible that 
we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion.  In that case, 
we can use the same transport contract on Lone Star and transport on other 
pipes also.  Any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed 
on to the plant.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Kathy-----Here is what I know about Cornhusker:

Our supply comes from Apache & Williams

Our market typicially is the plant (Tenaska IV Partners)
If the plant is down, Brazos Utility has the right to the gas if they want it
If Brazos does not call for the gas, then we will sell off to whomever we can

We just get a flat fee on this gas per MMBtu, whether it goes to the plant or 
not

Daren Farmer knows the specifics about the deal

Hope this helps, call with any questions.

After comparing HPL's numbers with PG&E's numbers I have found a few 
discrepancies with the Tufco volumes.  
 
   HPL   PG&E

5/8   137.500   139.583

5/11   103.750   100.833

5/19   108.333   8.333

Days 8 and 11 have small discrepancies.  I got with Carlos on the 5/19 
discrepancy.  He checked the numbers sent to him by Tufco.  He verified that 
it should be 8.333.  I also checked with Steve in Gas Control regarding what 
flowed for Tufco.  Steve told me 8.300.  I have gone back into MOPS and 
corrected these volumes.   This should impact the UA4 number.  Also, this 
decreases the MidTexas cumulative imbalance.  As of 5/23 PG&E owes HPL 
4.649.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Daren,

ATEs shows that your team has one specialist for 1497 in January and 
February.  Please let me know if ATEs is incorrect for the month of January 
and February.  If there is a specialist in your team, we have not received a 
survey from this person.  This lack of information prevents your expenses 
from being 100% allocated out to the commercial teams.  Please fill out the 
following survey and return it to me ASAP.  If you have any questions please 
call me at 3-3859.

Thanks,
Shari

extended into 2001.  These are deals with Teco.  Let me know if you need me

Should the entire volume be moved over to ICC now?  Currently on deal 131478 
(ICC), 10,000 is being sold at 2.84.  The sale on the TXU ticket has been 
zeroed out on the deal line, but needs to be reallocated in Vol Mgmt.  If I 
need to move the additional 25,000 to ICC, I will.  But, I want to make sure 
that is what we need to do.

All,

For those of you who have not responded to the prior parking email, please 
take a moment in doing do, as I am trying to get a firmed up number for 
future parking in our new building @ 1201 Louisiana.  I need to get the name

Megan, 

I have made these adjustments.  HOwever, I would like for you to double check 
August.  We knew that Pan Energy would be over delivering at Cotten Valley 
for 8/9/00 through the end of the month.  So I changed the pricing on the 
deal to the GD-.10 settlement price for that time period.

That's great.  What about deal 452475?  We have $0.10 and we are being billed 
$0.11 for meter 25000200 on contract 1856.  Also, I faxed the Oct 2000 TXU 
invoices to Trisha Hughes so she can look into the Dec 2000 and forward 
problem.

An adjustment is required on the Tufco contract for July 2000.  The volume 
for the 23rd was overstated by 5,000.  This resulted in revisions on the 23rd 
and 28th.  Please see the attached Tufco.  If you have any questions, give me 
a call @ 36905.

Liz or Stacey - There is flow at meter 74 on 9/14 (499 dth).  The deal for 
this meter (400289) did not start until 9/15.  Could one of you extend the 
deal for this?  I would be greatly appreciated.

A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.  I don't have a record 
of a spot deal with them for that day.

Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.  The 
price difference on that day is significant.  (HSC GD mid was 5.245).  If you 
don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is.

Daren,

I am handling CP&L and am trying to resolve this issue from February 
production.  CP&L shows 5,000 mmbtu on February 21, but we do not have a 
deal.  Were you able to find anything out about this?

Thanks for your help.

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his

invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.

Subject: Procedure for adding new Capacity tickets for multi-desk Service 
utilization - revised

Revision in bold.  Pass on to any who may need this.

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the "other" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
"Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed."
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent
  contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the Pipeline contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated 
rates, uncheck them as well.  The "primary" deal will carry the MDQ and
  any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.
 Hit Release.
e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number 
in the Service list now read "Multiple".  Right-click/Service Deals will list 
the  specific deals.
f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message 
should not appear again.

This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.
Please file this in your "Call Dave If I Can't Find This" folder.

Thanks, d.n.

I would like to talk about what we can do to make sure that effective 
training occurs in the future for new hires/transfers.  For example, we are 
giving an HPL training session today.  We should not have to give another 
full blown session in the future.  The group should be able to take this 
knowledge, add to it, and pass it on to others entering the group.  With the 
rate of turnover we have experienced in the past, it seems like some 
knowledge has been lost.

Flow for the following days are:

4/1 .461 decatherms
4/2 .453         "

Mary Jo,

Thanks for the update.  Regarding the notice provision of 6 business days
prior to the close of business on the last business day of the month prior
to selected month,  does that mean we need to give you notice for December
by Tuesday, November 21st at 5:00 PM or Monday, November 20th at 5:00 PM
assuming the 23rd and 24th are holidays?

I have rolled # 143559 through July 2000 to cover the purchase from 
Republic.  We sell this gas to Duke Energy Field Services (#143558 for Jan - 
Apr,  CES-Duke Energy Field Services, Inc ).  The counterparty on this deal 
has been suspeneded, so I created # 316727 under the counterparty of Duke 
Energy Field Services Marketing, LLC.

Hillary - Please extend the CES-Duke counterparty or attach the correct Duke 
counterparty to this deal.

If you have any questions, let me know.

I think Marta is referring to the supply deal 391119 on 9/6 for 10,545.  We 
do not have a price of GD + $0.04.  We have IF + $0.04.  Please check this 
price.  Also, they seem to be missing the overdelivery calculation in their 
spreadsheet.  Attached is the September 2000 spreadsheet.

BH, 

If the Super Saturday occurred on a different weekend, I would help you out.  
However, we have a pretty important family weekend coming up.  Cole's 3rd 
birthday is today.  We will be doing a little celebrating with that.  Plus, 
we are putting our house on the market this week and are scheduling 
appointments to view other houses.  Anyway, I hope everything else is going 
well for you.  We need to talk sometime.  I will call you in a couple of days.

Subject: Enron Industrial Markets - Super Saturday Recruiting

I need your help!  On Saturday, 01/20/01, EIM is having a Super Saturday to 
recruit experienced Commercial Support personnel to fill many of our 
vacancies.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough personnel to do the 
interviewing.  To round out the Logistics team, I am looking for one more 
interviewer.  The current team is Roy Lipsett, Dan Hamilton and Del Davis.  
Both Dan and Del are new to Enron (Del started 1/8 and Dan is still 
transitioning his prior job and moving to Houston), but bring a wealth of 
Logistics experience for our industries.  I would love to have one additional 
team member to provide input from the Enron perspective.  Will this candidate 
fit into the expectations of Enron?  Will the candidate compete when compared 
to their peers.  Unfortunately, Logistics candidates below Manager have been 
difficult to find from the industry.  There seems to be a tendancy towards 
clerical skill sets but compensation at a Specialist level.  Consequently, I 
have been cautious around these candidates as I would not want to set them up 
to fail.

I know the sacrifice of a Saturday, but I would value the input that any one 
of you might offer.  We do expect it to be a full day commitment as we have 
several candidates, and we will have a follow-up evaluation session.  I know 
I can't adequately compensate you for your day, but I would be happy to buy 
you a dinner for two.  Please let me know ASAP.  Assuming worst case that noe 
of you are available, I would welcome other suggestions.

In advance, I appreciate your help.

Brenda

Bruce, 

I need to hold the deliveries to 60,000 for 2/24.  I'm somewhat limited on my 
transport right now.  I will look into the possibility of increasing the 
volume, though.  If you can increase the deliveries at Fuels Cotton Valley, 
that will work.

Esther, 

Gary asked me to send this info to you for the business trip that I've 
invited him on.

  Enron employees will be leaving at 11:30am on Continental flight #1668 from 
Bush Intercontinental on Friday 8/4/00.

The return flight from Tampa will be Continental #1663 leaving Tampa at 3:20 
pm on Sunday, arriving in Houston at 4:29pm.

I believe that there are a couple of later flights on Friday (around 1:30 and 
3:30) if Gary needs to come in for a part of the day.  I will probably have 
to catch one of the later ones, but Gary is welcome to go whenever he likes.

If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905.

Subject: Tenaska IV Gas

Daren, per review of the Gas agreements between Tenaska IV and 
Williams/Apache and our understanding of the Agency agreement, I had a few 
items I  wanted to discuss with you (in lieu of our meeting today that was 
cancelled):

1. Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should 
have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285) 
and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary - 
230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at 
2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.

2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged 
$2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91  
price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at 
2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.

I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for 
2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment 
if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and 
increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at 
.0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.

In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price 
is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache 
invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at 
other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If 
Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a 
margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant 
should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.

Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and 
October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from 
Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot 
prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our 
meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of 
$.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas 
delivery points if my scenario above is correct).

So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their 
November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price 
differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of 
$484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of 
Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.

  Month   Plant Gas Price Amount
  November  267,300  2.91 $777,843 
  November adjustment    $(167,062.50)   
  October adjustment    $(184,138.99)
  Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000
  Sept. Agency Fee 98,813  .04 $3,592.52
       Total $484,234.03

I discussed these issues with Mike Mazowita, Rick Hill & Jody Pierce before 
reaching this conclusion.  Should you have any different ideas or thoughts 
that I am not covering, please call me at 3-7280 and we can discuss.  Thanks.

James

Julie, 

I need to know if the following deals have evergreen provisions to roll into 
Jan 2000.

contract
Cokinos / 6373  128952 - This is a GTC Spot
Coral / 4120  93883 - This is on a Single Transaction contract, we would need 
to check with the trader
Encina / 6392  93487 - Yes, this is a committed reserve.  I marked the 
evergreen flag.
Midcoast / 5097  92956 - No, GTC 1st Purchaser, deal expires with contract.
United O&M / 5053 93728 - No, this deal was moved to the Wellhead portfolio 
for January, but the deal was terminated per legal.
Vintage / 2540  93750 - Not the right deal number.

I've created deal 269123.  The pricing below looks in correct.  I have used 
85% of Gas Daily, instead of Gas Daily less 85% (That would only be 15% of 
Gas Daily.)  Please verify the price and let me know if we need to change the 
deal ticket.

Mary, 

These are transport related tickets.  Is this something that your group would 
look into?

Charlotte, 

I need you to find out what's going on with this point and the transport on 
Channel.  Apparantly, we are moving some gas on Channel from HPL #3455 to HPL 
#6490. (Deals 83084 and 83088).  Why has this occurred each month?

You may want to come to this meeting.  When we met with Bob Hall the other 
dayon OA, I mentioned that you and I should probably be included in the 
monthly meeting so that we would have an idea of any problems that were 
occurring each month.  If you have something else going on, don't worry about 
being there.  I'll relay the info to you.

Diane, 

I apologize for getting this to you so late.

I should have no staffing additions next year.

Staff 

Manager 1
Sr.  2 Average to High

Training

Both Seniors should attend 1 personal enrichment class (Effective 
Communication) and 1 Technical class.

I think that everything else should roll for next year. Let me know what else 
I need to give you.

Subject: BUDGET HELP!!

SALARIES, SALARIES, SALARIES!!!   Everyone is having problems.  
Unfortunately, many of
you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your 
staff's salary is.  I have the average
salary for each of the different staffing levels.  I have asked the HR 
department to also give me
the low and the high.  Let's face it - your staff today and their salary most 
likely are not what
they are going to be next year!  To much movement of people.  So using 
estimates and averages
will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels.

Here's what you can do:

1) Make a list of your staff just their positions.
2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to 
average, etc.
 You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that 
position, etc.
3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget.
4) Here is the average:

 Sr. $4,961
 Spec $3,964
 Staff $3,026
 Sr. Clrk $2,548
 Clerk $2,264
 Asst $3,162

Your list would look something like this:

 Assistant Average
 Clerk  Very High
 Sr. Clerk Low
 Specialist Low to Average
 Specialist Average
 Sr. Specialist Average to High
 Analyst  (They are all allocated at the same amount)

You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them.  It's up to you.

Next Item - TRAINING!!!

Here's what you can do:

1) List your staff and the type of class they need
2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what 
type
 of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or
 Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip)
3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700
4) The technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000.
5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest.

Next Item - Headhunters!

Try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees.


Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the 
year that
people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthday
ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts).  If you forget these 
items, I will
make sure it is added to your budget.


Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will 
review them
so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully 
this helps you some.

Daren, There are five HPLC purchase deals for 09/99 from Ocean Energy Inc.  
They were Craig Falbaum's deals.  A person who is no longer in my group 
suspended payment for these deals.  Gary suggested that I contact you and see 
if you have any insight as to why the deals might have been suspended, or 
know anything that might help.  Thanks.

Daren, I made sure the people you listed had the necessary access for the 
Texas region.  The only person that you listed that currently does not have 
access is Pat Clynes.  Pat will need to submit a security request in order to 
get access to Sitara.  In addition, I noticed that the people listed below 
had access to the Texas Logistics role in Sitara but were not included on 
your list.  Have they moved on to another group?  Please let me know, so that 
I can update their access accordingly.  Thank you for all your help.









Call me if you have any questions (x35423).

Due to the lack of space for the Sitara training, only 4 people can attend 
from Texas.  I think that it would be most beneficial if the newest members 
of the group attended this first meeting (Liz, Mary, Susan, and Sabrae).  
Russ will set up another session at a future date for others (Tom, Eddie, 
Mark).

Let me know if you have any questions.

The number of interested people turned out to be larger than the room can 
handle.  Can you just send 3 or 4 for this meeting and I will set up a

I will be giving a training session on Wed   9/13/00  in 21C2 from 3:00-4:30 
pm.
I would like for you to send to the class any new logistics personnel that 
you might think could use a Sitara overview.
If someone cannot make it at this time, let me know their names and I will 
try to schedule something for them at a later time.

If possible, please send me a note on who might be attending, so I can get an 
approximate head count.

Call me or e-mail me if you have any questions

Kris, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person.

We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas) 
Pipeline.  This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.  Duke 
(Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or 
5 months.  The deal in Sitara is #145125.  Please look into this and let me 
know where we stand.

Thanks.

I don't think that we should have any volume on this deal.  It seems like Jan 
2000 was added after the fact to assist with allocations.  But it was later 
determined that we didn't purchase anything from Copano.

Daren,

I'm looking into this deal.   There is no volume on this deal for January 
00.     Should this deal have had some volume on it.
It was never scheduled with volume  however, in January it received flow of 
3461 due to ranking in POPS.  It was taken to zero once the actuals came in.

Please let me know if you intended to have volume on this deal for Jan 00

We're working on it.  We have had alot of issues with the colder weather.  I

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Should these not be converted to ENA - IM Texas ???  Some time ago - we were 
told this desk was dead and the existing deals would end.  This desk is not 
included in any Texas desk portfolios.

The ECT desks are supposed to be inactive - however - these deals keep 
rolling - and 
someone created some new ones?   If the desk is active - should we change it 
to ENA - IM Waha - 
as ECT is no more ???

We have adjusted Suemar in Sitara.  And will probably adjust it again in a 
few days.  Since we bridge back estimates daily, the production at the 
Berryman well has been adjusted in the economics.  So, this will not have an 
impact on UA4.

Daren,

As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the Berryman well for 
OCT, which in turn affects our volumes at the Gulf Plains Plant.  From a 
physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced.  My concern is 
that we are "overproduced" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need 
to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a 
corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to 
keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not, 
please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month 
UA4.

Thank you,

Mary

We do not have deal to enter for this.  You need to look at the entire Midtex 
line for each of the days that are out of balance.  If we are short at Katy, 
I would think that we would be long at Dewville.  (Many times, our receipts 
from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the 
Tap.)  This should help you fix the January problem.  Also, for December, you 
may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western.  Is it at HPL 
Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex 
line?  In any case, we don't have deliveries to make.  The only other remedy 
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance.

Daren - can you set up a delivery deal for meter 8740 for Jan 00 and Dec. 
99?   I checked OSS and there is an 089 operational contract that took the 
swing in case the meter flows more or less than the nom.   Third party 
contracts are supposed to stay whole.  Days 12-14 did not flow enough to 
cover the noms for Western.  We have the same problem on Jan. 25.  Please let 
me know, Brenda Herod would like this resolved today, as would I.

Stacy- Can you please set up a new deal for meter 8740 for Dec. 99.  The 
problem with this meter is,  all third party transports should stay whole and 
HPL takes the swing.  Several days the meter did not flow enough and the 
third parties did not receive all of their gas.  I need a delivery set up so 
the 3rd parties will stay whole.  If you have any questions, please let me

Aimee,

 We are still having problem with this meter.  From what I understand of our 
conversation a week or two ago, HPL needs to take the swing to keep the other 
contracts whole.  In the case where we have excess flow the HPL (R) contract 
takes the swing.  So in the case where we are short, shouldn't we have a HPL 
(D) contract to take the swing?  Please let me know if this will work.  I 
need to get back with Settlement today.  Thanks

Subject: Aquila Header (Meter #980072) - January Volumes

Daren,

On January 15 and 16, HPL bought some gas from Western Gas Resources at the 
Aquila Header (10.000 and 5.000 MMBTU's respectively).  This was a late 
Friday change so in order to get it scheduled in POPS, the gas was scheduled 
on the stranger's gas contract.  However, deal ticket #143709 was never 
updated to reflect those late changes.  Please let me know if you want me to 
update the deal ticket.  Thanks, Susan.

Aimee, 

Please take care of this in POPS.  It looks like we've already hit the 50,000 
mark on #572910.

Just want to make sure volumes are allocated to two different tickets 
correctly for March:

Sitara - 572910 - gets 50,000 MMBtu TOTAL for the month .... after 50,000 on 
this ticket, all remaining volumes go to ...

Sitara 643510 - the swing ticket

THANKS

Attached is a revised allocation file for October.  Please note that the 
format of this file has been changed to reflect the new team reporting list.  
Also, "Global Markets" and "Industrial Markets" have been broken out for 
billing purposes.  If you have cost centers that are allocating to either of 
these teams, please provide a breakdown of those percentages by Monday, 
November 6th.

All other allocations are due by end of day today.

I have also included the team reporting list that is currently in use until 
the end of 2001. 

Thank you for your help.  Please call if you have any additional questions.

Daren,

I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on 
the first two days.  However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we 
have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few 
days in the middle.  Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85% 
of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on Strangers until we determine 
what to do.  I am now on the dreaded ua4 list from Vol. Mgmt.

Mary

Eric, 

I recieved a call from a guy with Pacific Interlink (?).  He is looking to 
market LNG in Europe.  Since I have very little knowledge in this area, I 
didn't get much specific information.  But, I told him I would find someone 
for him to talk with.  His name is Sam Kovacevich.  Phone:  847-971-3369.  I 
would appreciate it if you would give Sam a call.  If you aren't the person 
he needs to talk to, please let me know.  Thanks.

We do not have storage in a facility on PG&E.  But, we do use parking and

Has any progress been made on this?  So far, I have only received information 
on Cove Point.

We show that there is physical storage on the following pipelines:

CENTRAL -  Mid Continent, Moss Bluff, NGPL, and Reliant.
TEXAS - Bammel, Centana, and PG&E Texas Pipeline.
WEST - Colorado, PG&E (one contract), PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest, 
Questar, and Williston
EAST - Cove Point, Dominion, Columbia Gas, Gulf South (Koch), National Fuel, 
Sonat, Tennessee, Transco, Egan, and Napoleonville.
SITHE - Union

Please provide the requested information below.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Gas Accounting is initiating a project to ensure consistent treatment of 
physical storage between flash and the GL.  To that end, please provide the 
book codes and cost of inventory schedules that you have for each of the 
physical storage facilities.  We will also need what you show as the 1/31/01 
inventory balance for each.

David, 
I believe that we already have the information for Bammel.  Please provide 
the info for other Texas desk storage, if any.  

I would like to have this information as soon as possible.

Thanks, everyone.

Will you please get with Mary Smith and Trisha Hughes with the Texas Rates

and pick up from them the off system pipeline rates that they are handling.

You may want to visit with Daren Farmer also about the level of activity.

We need to transition this work to your team as soon as possible.

Thanks

Daren do you have a problem if I copy the 2000 deal (362125) for Pioneer and 
make a new one for 2001.  They have flow in Jan. This is giving me a meter 
allocation exception forJan.  Let me know thanks.

I have created two new deals in Sitara.  You will need to get with someone in 
Volume Management to reallocate volumes from the old tickets to the new deals 
for Jan-Sep.  The Logistics group will be able to adjust October forward.  

Deal #s:

144052 --> 440092
144049 --> 440093

Let me know if you have any questions.

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Thanks,

Have you been able to work out these transport pricing differences for Oct. 
2000?  We have only been able to pay $4,000.00 of the $28,000.00 invoice.  
The pricing for Nov. 2000 (deal 452491) has problems too.  We have $0.01 for 
11/3 at meter 20014804 and TXU is billing us $0.10 at meter 25000200 and 
$0.02 at meter 20014903 for the entire month.

I have also noticed that we are not accruing any transport for Dec 2000 
forward.  We have received the Dec. 2000 invoice from TXU, but we do not have 
a deal to pay them.  We should be getting Jan. 2001 next week.  Is there a 
deal for these months?

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Thanks,

Sherlyn, 

The base purchase should be brokered with the base sale.  Deal 135563 does 
not replace the basse purchase ticket, it is in addition to that one.  On the 
days where deal 135563 is applicable, the purchases and sale should balance 
out;  no flow.

Please forward this on to your people. 

I hope you are ready to BOWL!!!!  Tomorrow we will meet in the lobby at 2:45 
and begin to load our buses and depart for the bowling alley.  Their will be 
two buses departing at 2:45 and at 3:00 just to make sure we get any 
stragglers.  

As soon as we arrive you will join your team members (your teams have already 
been chosen and there is no swapping, negotiating or shuffling allowed).  You 
will be notified tomorrow as we depart who is on your team and their will be 
signs at the bowling alley marking the lanes for each team. 
 
Our plan is to bowl three games or until time allows.  At 5:30 we will gather 
for prizes and awards and depart at 6:00. 

Please see your admin today for your bowling shirt.  We highly encourage you

I know we transported on Midcon due to problems with the plant at the point.  
I am not sure about the rate.

Kellie-

I researched the statements you sent me and found deal ticket #109925 in 
Sitara which shows HPLC transporting on Midcon from Live Oak to Hardy Street 
for $.04/mm for the months of August and September.

The statement for November covers gas moving from Katy tailgate to Cogen 
Lyondell and is covered by Sitara deal ticket #133257.  The deal ticket shows 
a zero rate, however.  Elsa/Daren- do either of you remember this deal?  It 
was on November 30th for 5000mm.  Kellie- what is Midcon charging for this 
haul?

Thanks.

We didn't buy anything from Pan Energy at Centana Mobil until April the 3rd.  
So, we shouldn't pay for this gas.

PanEnergy purchase: Deal #231758.
 
Gas in the amount of 271 mmbtus for April 1st was purchased from PanEnergy on 
deal # 231758 . 
However, scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day 
one and as a result, it is not pathed in the system.
 
Could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn't be a sale 
so that Scheduling can either path April 1st or I can dispute the volume 
being billed to us by Pan Energy. 


This is part of Pan Energy's exchange deal.

 As I  told Thu before (see below), I did not see any volumes for that deal 
in 4/00. I think this volume is some residue that flow from the last day in 
March and probably should be allocated to that month. I dont show a deal to

Katherine,

 This is a brokered deal (Buy Deal 231758 and Sell Deal 93472).  This first 
day was not pathed, that's why you are missing volume of 271.  Per Carlos 
(see below) the deal was not for day one.

Nagesh, 

Please resort the pipeline order on the Texas/HPLC position screen in CPR.  
The current sort makes it difficult for us to manage our trading position 
each day.  The arrangement  (from the top of the screen to the bottom) that 
would most benefit us is listed below:

Houston Pipe Line
East Texas Gas System
NNGB
Oasis
PG&E Valero
All remaining pipes listed in alphabetical order by pipe name.


Please look into this and let me know of any problems in making these changes.

Thanks.

Phillips said we shorted them gas on December 1st so they pulled it on 
January 1.  Can we verify that we did not deliver 5,00 on Dec. 1?  If that is 
the case and this was a firm sale, we owe him some gas at Dec Index less 
(.045).  Which is bad!  Let me know what happened in Dec before I can put

Cheryl, 

The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:

City of Brazoria
Central Illinois Light Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Markham Gas 
Merit Energy Partners
Praxair
Reliant Energy - Entex
Reliant Energy - HL&P
Southern Union Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co)
Union Carbide Corporation
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc


ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most 
likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)

All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be 
generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let me 
know if you need something like that.  

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Just to update you on this project's status:

Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come up 
with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas off 
of HPL's pipe.

Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc.
Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc.
Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex
CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P
Central Illinois Light Company  Southern Union Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution
Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation
Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.


Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes 
suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing 
something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him 
and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the 
above contracts.

Subject: ENA Sales on HPL

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you 
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for 
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & 
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to 
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is 
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity 
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will 
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in 
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas 
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some 
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.

Subject: King Ranch

I just spoke briefly with Brian Riley, who is working to restructure the Knig 
Ranch contracts with Exxon, and put Coastal into the loop.  Yesterday I 
forwarded each of you an E-mail from Steve Van Hooser which had drafts of 
contracts attached.  As I talked with Brian, the King Ranch set up as he is 
negotiating will be simplified.  The intent, as I understood it, is that we 
will no longer buy at the wellhead.  Rather, Coastal is entering into a a 
gathering agreement with HPL to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant.  
HPLC will buy at the tailgate of the plant, net of PVR.  So there will not be 
future settlements with Exxon on liquids.  The paper has not been returned 
from Coastal or Exxon yet, but the deal is effective 4/1/00.  Everything will 
be under new agreements, with receipts and deliveries by different 
counterparties.  The gas flow continues the same, just under new contracts 
and different counterparties.

Daren, Pat and Stella:  Daren, Brian said he would get with you to discuss 
the deal in further detail.  Please include Pat and Stella in the discussion 
also.  The contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper 
scheduling.  As I mentioned to Greg Sharp and Brian, it is critical that we 
be kept in the loop, especially on retroactive deals, as scheduling, 
transport rates and risk are affected.

Thanks to everyone for ensuring the communication lines are in place.

Is this date really June of 1999?  Hopefully we're not just finding out about 
this?

I don't think we can even process this request.  The East Desk was not up and 
running on Unify in June of 1999.  All of our pathing for June of 1999 was in 
Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so 
small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let 
this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???

I welcome your thoughts.

Daren,

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume 
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?

Thanks

Bob, 

I didn't check voice mail until this morning (I don't have a blinking light.  
The assistants pick up our lines and amtel us when voice mails have been 
left.)  Anyway, with the uncertainty of the future business under the Texas 
Desk, the following are my goals for the next six months:

1)  Ensure a smooth transition of HPL to AEP, with minimal upsets to Texas 
business.
2)  Develop operations processes and controls for the new Texas Desk.   
3)  Develop a replacement
 a.  Strong push to improve Liz (if she remains with Enron and )
 b.  Hire new person, internally or externally
4)  Assist in develop a strong logisitcs team.  With the new business, we 
will need strong performers who know and accept their responsibilites.

1 and 2 are open-ended.  How I accomplish these goals and what they entail 
will depend how the Texas Desk (if we have one) is set up and what type of 
activity the desk will be invovled in, which is unknown to me at this time.  
I'm sure as we get further into the finalization of the sale, additional and 
possibly more urgent goals will develop.  So, in short, who knows what I need 
to do.

Volume Management should be fine with this change. All name changes will be 
still attached to the original path of the Buy/Sell deal. The Settlement 
Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the 
deal has the appropriate 'Statement Group' attached.  Other than that this 
change should flow smoothly.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 
8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold 
to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not 
enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with 
the customers. 

Buy from Tenaska IV
 July 399763
 Aug 399773

Sell to Tenaska Marketing
 July 399791
 Aug 399797

Sell to ANP
 Aug 399814

The trading desk these are on is "ENA-IM Cleburne".

Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany 
mail.  (I received both invoices this week)

 I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.  Tanks.

Howard, 

The Park  and Ride deals should be booked to a transport contract.  Desk to 
desk deals should be on the transport contract also.

Daren,
Just a quick note to follow up on UA4 issues.

For desk to desk deals, we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not 
a Co 16 contract with Co 16 and attaching an ECT transport contract to the 
backscreen.

On Park and ride deals, I am under the impression that the Park and ride deal 
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a 
subsequent month.
If this is true, was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous Co 
89 entry.  I am not sure whether an ECT transport should be attached.  I hope 
you have some insight on this issue.

Let me know
HC

Subject: Saxet Canales into King Ranch - Balancing issue

FYI - 

We are having some "after-the-fact" balancing issues with King Ranch.  I just 
spoke with Carol regarding our net position with the plant, she has informed 
me that the Saxet Canales production we are buying at the inlet has been 
averaging approximately 3,850 Dth/day for January, and has been producing at 
or around that level since November.  We don't have eyes at the meter, 
however, Carol was brought online this past week, and I will be receiving 
production information on a regular basis to balance redeliveries.

We have been scheduling 838 to 1,045 Dth/day at the meter.  We need to gross 
up for Jan in order to ensure that we capture our volumes correctly and do 
not create additional balancing issues with the plant.

Please let me know if you have any further questions, or need additional 
information.

Mary

Daren,

I have flow at this meter for the first, 118 Dth.  There is an expired 
purchase from Highland at the meter, but, this deal ended August 31st.  HPL 
had a deal with Highland in October to purchase these volumes (deal ticket 
418382).  I think that the deal needs to be extended, it looks like the valve 
was not completely shut by 9 am.  Pat has asked that this issue be resolved 
today, so, your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I moved the Cannon sale volumes from #170335 to #529753 effective 12/14/00.  
You will need to re-nom #529753 for all prior days at zero and then allocate 
volumes at each meter from the old deal to the new deal.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.

First, here are the TAG Nos. of the trades we wish to have assigned.

Second, several trades are listed within a ERMS book called:  P A M
These trades show a 12-31-00 expiry and their Nos. are:

I am not sure what these numbers are.  But, could you move them as well.

Subject: Entex Estimates for 12/99

Attached are two spreadsheets showing Entex data for Dec. 99.

Jan00_factor shows the difference between the estimates that should have fed 
over to POPs and the actual for all meters in the meter set {2001-2500, 2540, 
3509, 3519, 3530, 3533, 6822, 9544}.  I do not have the actual for Vidor CG 
yet.  I have estimated the volume to be 190.00.

Actuals were 6105.26 Mmcf using the Vidor CG estimate
Estimates were 4870.37 Mmcf. 
Difference of 1237.89 Mmcf.  (About 1,250,000 Mmbtu)



Jan00_scada shows that if we had correct information from the Hempstead CG 
RTU the difference would have been 819.186 Mmcf.



If you have any questions please call.

Daren,

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks

Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you 
please take a look.

Hey Anita,
For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.

have the September deal priced at Gas Daily also.  Since this was flowing on

I have reviewed the Entex actuals and adjusted Gas Control's Entex factor for 
the month of May.  I have found that Entex estimates have been overstated by 
approximately 10.0 Mmcf/Day.

Romeo:

Will you make sure the estimates that are in POPs are corrected to reflect 
the new volumes.  This should help reduce some of the UA4 that Daren and Pat 
are trying to locate.  

The attached file has the changes that need to be made.  Please let everyone 
on this mailing list know once the changes have been made.

You will need to re-nom #529753 for all prior days at zero and then allocate

FYI,  I was watching the position manager for ENA and noticed some business 
transactions on this pipeline.  This pipeline was bought by Duke Energy Field 
Services effective 8/1/99.  All HPLC transactions were moved to that pipe at 
that time.  The CES transactions that are current on this pipe should be 
moved to Duke Energy Field Services.  I believe the pipe was renamed when 
they bought it back in June or July.

If you have any questions, or want to verify this information, I would check 
with the Global contracts dept.

Stace, 

Please look into your notes.  You entered deal 214948 each day for the 
purchases at this meter for the month.  The 12th and 13th are ok in Sitara.  
However, there is nothing for the 15th and 16th.

See notes in red below.  In each case where the contract has been terminated, 
Tom and/or Carlos will need to get with Producer Services to determine what 
we need to do (set up a GTC, renegotiate the term deal, etc).

Daren, can you help me with placing K's @ the below listed meters?  I don't 
know if these deals should be rolled or if new ones were set up.

I'll need a K @ each specified meter for the month following the noted month 
that had a K @ it.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: March Activity Survey

As you are aware, we are starting to collect data for our March price model. 
I've attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be driving your 
costs from the activities to the commercial teams.  In the 'Data' tab, please 
select the your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver 
for the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver 
survey with March numbers for your RC by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If 
your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed 
data, please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list 
beginning next month.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey 
every month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone 
within your team beginning next month, please let me know.  

Please take this opportunity to verify the following:
1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to 
perform these activities for each commercial team.
2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified 
(please let us know otherwise)
3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example "Allocate 0469" or 
"80-20 Split"), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not 
changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new 
allocation is).

In reference to these surveys, please note:
If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams 
listed in the survey, please identify them.  We will take your business 
support costs (such as feedback, training, etc.) and allocate them evenly 
among these teams.
The costs for "commercial team specific" activities that you filled time out 
for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial 
team (e.g. Genco Support will trace 100% of its costs to Genco).  

Please let us know if you have any questions on this survey.  

Regards,
Shari

Megan, 

I have created deal 514353 to capture the $.04 agency fee for the Tenaska 
deal.  This deal will have zero volume and zero commodity price with a demand 
charge of $.04 on 45,000/day.  Since there is no volume, Mark McCoy will be 
scheduling this deal as a zero nom.  Hopefully, this will allow the demand 
charge to flow through the system.  Let me know if you don't see this 
happening.  For Sep and Oct, you will need to get someone in Volume 
Management to create an accounting arrangement for this deal (pathed to the 
imbalance pool).  When actuals come in, you can give me the volumes and I 
will change the demand charge.  I took the demand charge off of the sale 
ticket (#384258).

Apr,  CES-Duke Energy Field Services, Inc ).  The counterparty on this deal

Hillary - Please extend the CES-Duke counterparty or attach the correct Duke

jACKIE, 

You need to talk to the East desk to see if they were allocated this extra 
gas on the 14th and 15th.  If they were, we can change the deal.  If not, the 
pipes will need to balance out during the next flow day.

FYI

Daren---On the 12th, there is a sale to Aquila on the Header system, for 
10,000........I think we were supplying it with AEC.  For whatever reason, I 
had the AEC 10.0 @ #11230 into Midcon...which isnt right because there was no 
market for it, and Midcon wasnt looking for it, but the Aquila deal was at 
#700 on WGR (Aquila).  So I went ahead and changed the AEC ticket to match up 
with the Aquila deal. Let me know if you think it is incorrect.

Thanks,
Mark

A small volume (352 Dth) flowed on the 10th at Flagstaff meter, I think it

Daren,

Stacey is out of the office today, I hope you can help.  Deal 107937 was 
originally set up for 155,000, but the nom was changed to 140,000.  I show 
5,000 was purchased from Conoco, where did HPLC get the additional 135,000?  
Sitara shows HPLC IM Wellhead.    Joanie Ngo says TXU is saying they bought 
155,000.   I am trying to back track to the purchase invoices to see what we 
were invoiced.

Hi Daren,
I received an email from Kenny Soignet to make sure everything was in the 
system for me to pay Cannon on Friday, 5/19/00.
The deal # is 257141.  I see that the volume has not been scheduled, so 
therefore it is not pulling into unify for me to pay.  
Are you the person that will be able to schedule the volume in order for me 
to pull up this deal?
( I see that in sitara that the deal is set for 5/00 production, does that 
matter? )

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Hi Julie, I have a question and I wasn't sure of who to start with.  I have a 
new meter for C&E Operating, meter # 0989813 that started up Nov.29.  I have 
a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29th and 30th, a 
total of 660mmbtu.  The problem is there is nothing in the system for meter # 
9813 for 11/99 production.  I looked in Sitara,( sitara # 132030 ) and the 
deal  starts for 12/99 production.   I checked with Donald to make sure and 
he says that the meter did start up 11/29 and the price is HSC less $.10.  In 
order to get this deal into the system, who do I need to talk to???

Thanks,  Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Stephanie,

The problem with the January payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly 
in sitara.   For January production deal 153864 shows HPLC purchasing gas 
from GMT Company Inc, not GMT Inc.  Someone needs to either correct the deal 
for 1/00 or put in a new deal, then I can do an accounting arrangement to 
make the necessary correction.    It is correct for 2/00 on deal 156292.  I 
emailed Daren on this because I see his name in sitara as the contact, but I 
am not sure who actually takes care of it.

I'm not sure if this is your meter or not.  If it is not, could you please 
pass this email on to the correct person.
For meter # 9814, Jan. 2000 production, the volume was allocated to the wrong 
company.  The gas was allocated to GMT Company Inc., but it should have been
allocated to GMT, Inc.  For Feb. 2000 it is done correctly.
I need to recoup the money from GMT Company, so could you please let me know 
when the change has been made in the system.
Thanks for your help.

Would you look into this and have them paid as promptly as possible?  It

Although the gas is non-spec, the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough 
that it can be blended okay before reaching Beaumont.  GO FOR IT.

As a precaution, we are starting a trend and I want to be very cautious.  
Once we connect a well, we can't go backwards.  Please be specific with GMT 
and limit him to this one well.  Otherwise he could drill more wells and flow 
them ALL through this new meter.

Hey, Byron.

We may be interested in your sofa.  Send me the pictures when you get a 
chance.  Now that we are moving, we've got a few empty rooms.  Thanks.

Hello friends,

Leslie and I have a sleeper sofa, a real sturdy and heavy one, that we are
wanting to get rid of.  It has a very comfortable bed and would be great for
an extra room in the house.  It is in great condition other than some cat
claws in the arms...done before I cut out the claws.

I have pictures I can e mail if you are interested.  We will give it away or
sell it to the highest bidder!

Byron

Susan,

Please see the attached file for January's production estimate.  This is 
pretty much the final estimate except that I have calls in to Costilla &  
Walter (Superior).  They both said that they would fax their nom once it was 
complete.  Hopefully this will be by Monday.  If not, all of the traders have 
reviewed the estimate and made their changes.  I feel pretty confident that 
this is a good number.  However, if your should receive any noms before 
Monday at noon, please update the file and send it to Carlos and Daren.

Thanks and Merry Christmas to you and yours!

FYI - did a baseload deal with Union Carbide at Seadrift HPL meter # 1332 for 
Oct00 that will require some coordination with Terry Calvert of Union 
Carbide, who can be reached at 713-973-5665.  I want to pass on details in 
case I'm out when he calls - I'm going to pass on y'all's phone #'s to Terry

Here's the deal:

10,000/d @ IFHSC - $0.04
10,000/d @ GD-HSC mid - $0.03

PLUS

0 to 10,000/d swing to be nominated day before @ GD-HSC mid - $0.03

So Terry knows he's supposed to call us by 9.30am if he wants gas to take any 
of the last tier.

All the above is in Sitara 415267

Thanks

Lee

Bob, 

On the Texas desk, the majority of our deals are nominated manually (on Excel 
or preprinted forms), with most of the information pulled from Sitara instead 
of Unify.  So, these noms were not late.  For a couple of 3rd party 
pipelines, we do use Unify.  But we did not have nom changes for 5/4.  Our 
only problem was sending noms to HPL.  Which is sending information to 
yourself, but it still delays the confrimation process for the pipeline.  
This nom was sent about 30 minutes late.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Subject: Valero -- Meter 8018

Deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of January 20. The 
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned 
turnaround.

It is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation 
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown.

Please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer.

This is a follow up to the earlier email I forwarded regarding CES historical

so I need your responses by Thursday 1/13. 

Please fill out the spreadsheet for each area and forward back to me. I will 
consolidate our responses from a Logistics perspective. Lets have them add 
everything they need and if challenged we can re-review later.

Last month Richard Burchfield sent us the following list of reports that are 
available from CES's systems.  IT is working on a way to secure an electronic 
copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the 
electronic document management system.  While ENA is not liable for pre-2000 
business, we may need to assist with research as issues arise.  In order to 
get the ball rolling, we need to get a list together of the reports we need.  
Please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need 
and return it to me by Friday, 1/15/2000.  If you do not want any reports, 
please send me an Email letting me know that.  I have included samples of how 
to fill this out, and if you have any questions please give me a call.

If you aren't sure which reports you need based on the names, please get with 
any CES employees you have hired or with a CES transition employee to get 
clarification.  If you need samples of any of these reports please let my 
assistant, Pam Chambers, know and she will coordinate getting a sample report 
printed for you.  

In addition, I will need a list of the users and their logonid's who will 
need to have access to this data.  Please send that to me by the 15th as 
well.  

Thanks, Bryce

Clay,
     I have had several requests from the ENA business groups. now that the
agreement has been finalized, for report lists from your key applications, 
those
being, Altra GMS and Risk Works( there may be others as people become more
aware). There will be a need for information for ENA to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period. We feel this would be an easier process to 
work
through if ENA knows what kind of information they can request as we go 
through
the transition.

Thanks, Richard

Sales 
#451362

We billed Wyman Gordon 363 mmbtus at $4.7328 in Sept 2000.

 I spoke with Richard Moran at Wyman Gordon and he indicated that he has not 
had any physical gas deals with us in over a year and does not owe us the 
$1,718.01 we billed him for September.

Can you please validate if this is his gas or if this deal ticket should have 
been linked to some type of financial deal.  

Thanks- Katherine

Mary Gregg from LCRA said that Sitara #283939 should have been for 
$4.50/MMBtu.  Currently in Deal Manager-Sitara, it is at $2.50 and that is

all of February and be priced at 100% Gas Daily less $0.16.

Subject: Basin Production from GA 213

I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin production 
from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the 
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect 
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best 
sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve 
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows 
stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this 
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close 
watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for 
liquids fallout.

You need to path the change at mtr 8055.  You should not path the buyback at 
mtr 1040 (Only deals 538950 and 702826 should be pathed with volume.  All 
other deals at mtr 1040 should be pathed with zero volumes.)

Daren,
I have HPL Resources meter 988055 wasn't sure if I should path this for April 
3rd's deal change.
and I have Mobil Oil meter 981040 that I pathed on the first for 30,000 that 
change to 50,000 for the 3rd.
I didn't path them since they are industrials and Aimee's notes told me to 
path Industrials -
except for a few exceptions.

Subject: Teco's Indian Spring Plant

A meeting was held on November 1, 2000 at 3 pm in EB3270 to resolve Exxon's 
residue volume issue at Teco's Indian Spring Plant.   Exxon's issue is that 
the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for 
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to 
PGE.   

Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved:

 1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line 
attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production.
 2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis 
elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects 
to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL.
 3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco 
can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes. 
 4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate 
the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue 
to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must 
pay to Teco an additional $500 per month.

Solution:
 1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884 
that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line.
 2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL 
Meter #986884. 
 3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset 
volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes.
 4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack 
Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d.

If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please 
let me know at X-36650.

Thanks, Clem

Jackie, 

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add 
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was 
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in 
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

Subject: Meter 984132 for 1/16/99

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

Daren - Would there be a problem if I created a desk to desk for meter 378 
for  March 2000 going forward?  It would help out with the allocation 
process.  The kind of deal I need is the total opposite of deal # 115101.  
Please let me know if there is a problem. Volume management would like this 
done today.  Thanls.

The ENA 012-27049-02-002 and HPL 012-41500-02-016 contract are not at Meter 
378 for March 2000.  I need for you to put the correct deal number for both 
contracts in Path Manager.

We need the ENA 202 contract as a delivery and the HPL 216 as a receipt.  
Please get the deal in the System this morning and let me know what the deal 
numbers are and I will set up the arraignments and let you know what the 
Track ID's are.

Thanks,

Fred

Guys, 
Just thought you might find this interesting.? I was forwarded this 
poem, and told it was written by a high school student in Az. 
Regardless, of who/where (not the point) I find it interesting, weirdly 
amusing, and frighteningly fairly accurate.- PB 

Now I sit me down in school 
Where praying is against the rule 
For this great nation under God 
Finds mention of Him very odd. 

If Scripture now the class recites, 
It violates the Bill of Rights. 
And anytime my head I bow 
Becomes a Federal matter now. 

Our hair can be purple, orange or green, 
That's no offense, it's a freedom scene. 
The law is specific, the law is precise. 
Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice. 

For praying in a public hall 
Might offend someone with no faith at all. 
In silence alone we must meditate, 
God's name is prohibited by the state. 

We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks, 
And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks. 
They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible. 
To quote the Good Book makes me liable. 

We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen, 
And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King. 
It's "inappropriate" to teach right from wrong, 
We're taught that such "judgments" do not belong. 

We can get our condoms and birth controls, 
Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles. 
But the Ten Commandments are not allowed, 
No word of God must reach this crowd. 

It's scary here I must confess, 
When chaos reigns the school's a mess. 
So, Lord, this silent plea I make, 
Should I be shot; My soul please take!

Sorry about this, Victor.  I didn't even pay attention to the date.  I was 
thinking this was October business.  We will definitely be able to do 
somthing with this on our side and not involve the East Desk.

Is this date really June of 1999?  Hopefully we're not just finding out about 
this?

I don't think we can even process this request.  The East Desk was not up and 
running on Unify in June of 1999.  All of our pathing for June of 1999 was in 
Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so 
small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let 
this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???

I welcome your thoughts.
Victor

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume

The term contract with Four Square attached to deal #138049 has been 
terminated.  Therefore, we need to take that deal to zero for August 2000 
forward.  Additionally, we entered into a base load (August only) deal to 
purchase the gas from Four Star at mtr 6599 (#348446).  The 1,500/day should 
be schueduled on this deal.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

 Deal 138049 is committed reserve long term gas totaling 1,350mm per day 
which is a good deal.
 
 However, deal #:  348446 is a  duplicate deal which was overstated and 
should be zeroed out {bad deal}.
 
 This is Vance response to an inquiry made by Bob.
 
 Daren, do you want me to zero out  deal #: 348446 ?

I extended the deal at mtr 6719 to include 2/10.   In the future, please run

Hi Daren,

Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters 
can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so 
that Anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me?

98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the deal 
is not effective until  February the 11th.
     No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the 
gathering (96026573) K which is the only
     K @ the meter.

98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is 
flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/2000 
production which is the only K @ the meter.


Thanks

Mtr 1534 - I created deal 238899 for 3/2-31/00 and #238900 for Apr.

Mtr 6725 - This meter is traded daily (spot) so, we can't extend the deal.

98-6725 is also on the 215K for 3/2000.  The Sitara deal # is 214948 and

Subject: Organizational Changes

Last week you all received a memo from Brent Price which described changes 
within Gas Operations, excluding Texas.  Attached is an organizational chart 
for the Texas region.  

We too continue to look for efficiencies to ensure we meet the demands of our 
customers.  We currently support the Texas trading region, Bammel Storage 
Facility, Houston Pipeline, Powder River Gathering and Bridgeline.  I am 
pleased to announce that we will also combine Risk Management, Deal 
Validation and Operational Analysis under the management of Steve Venturatos 
who will serve as the Business Controller.  Dave Baumbach will fill the Lead 
position.  Ami Chokshi will move from Trading Support to the new group, 
continuing in the role of the Entex and TUFCO account manager.  Jody Crook 
also will join the team.  Bryan Hull will transition his knowledge over the 
next month, and will be moving to has second rotation, effective 6/5/00.  
Additionally, Will Kelly will transition the Denver trading books to the 
Texas team as he moves to the East Region.  Transportation Management under 
Mary Smith will NOT be integrated into the team as their day-to-day 
responsibilities and projects are not cohesively aligned with this group.  
Please join me in welcoming the new team members as well as the team members 
who will continue in the group.

Mike Eiben will step in the role previously managed by Steve Venturatos which 
includes Global Contracts and Facilities, System Enhancements and Regulatory 
Reporting.  In addition, Clem Cernosek and Jennifer Pattison will be assuming 
new responsibilities in Logistics and Volume Management, respectively.  Both 
Clem and Jennifer have been on the Unify team, focused on POPS.  Please wish 
these folks success in their new roles.

All responsibility changes are effective 5/1/00.



Please share this with your staffs.

During June, Coral transacted on EOL.  However, they selected a July thru 
October deal by mistake.  The marketer immediately called the desk and we 
agreed to let them out of the deal, which resulted in the creation of a 
second deal in EOL.  Coral is not reporting anything on the deal, since it 
was unwound.  But, since EOL deals are automatically processed and are firm 
transactions, we cannot kill the deal on our side, even though they net to 
zero volume and price.  Logistics will be brokering the transactions in 
MOPS.  Please be sure that Coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals.  
Again, they will not have a record of the deals.

The Sitara deals are: 287946 and 288653.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Jackie, Talk to Darren about this. The deal you reference is an HPL deal with 
Dynegy and I don't have access to it. I'm on the East desk. Yesterday I 
extended the deal 421415 for the 6th and 19th and Meredith inserted a path in 
Unify - TETCO  to cover the small overflow volume between HPL and ENA. The 
ENA/HPL piece is done. The piece between HPL and Dynegy is what you need 
inserted.THANKS

the deal extended for Dynegy and let you know when it's done.

Victor, can you extend the deal 422516 for days 6 and 9 please?  Thanks.  Oh 
and by the way, I had mistaken you for someone else when I sent you the 
e-mail on yesterday.  Sorry.  I thought that I knew you.  Anyway, please 
advise when you've extended the deal so that Sherlyn can create an accounting

I don't want to tell you to add any contracts, because I am not sure about 
that.   I am just saying if you look at Ray's schedule there are 2 deals out 
there, one is a purchase from ENA and the other a purchase from Dynegy.  The 
track id I gave you was for ENA.   You  cannot allocate the Dynegy piece 
until I give you a track id.   I cannot give you a track id until the deal is 
extended for days 10/6 and 10/19.

Arre you saying that for both days that two (2) ENA contracts should be 
placed at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the 
total volume to each contract?

Subject: Re: Enerfin meter 980439 for 10/00  

Jackie,
You did not allocate this according to Ray's schedule.  The track id I gave 
you was only for the purchase from ENA.   You need to extend the deal for the 
purchase from Dynegy.   You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ENA, 
that is not what is on Ray's schedule, so we are still out on the 
interconnect report.

Jackie,

Your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10/6 and 10/19 where 
strangers gas is allocated.    I have created an accounting arrangement for 
these days and the new track id for ENA is 240384.  Please allocate the ENA 
portion according to Rays schedule for these 2 days.    Deal 422516 (Purchase 
from Dynegy) needs to be extended for these 2 days so I can do an accounting 
arrangement.   Alfonso  I need for you to allocate your meter daily, because 
we have tiered pricing this month.

Thanks.

In February, 539,594 Mmbtu were allocated to the our index purchase from HPLR 
Liquids at King Ranch.  This allocation resulted in a large physical 
unaccounted for loss.  Effectively, the gas was being purchased twice in our 
systems.  In addition, a sale to the Liquids group, which should have been 
zero, was brokered with a purchase from Swift (2500 Mmbtu/day), resluting in 
additional gas being allocated to the HPLR Liquids purchase contract.  I have 
attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in 
February.  This schedule also reports the daily volumes for March which will 
need to be adjusted.  I have calculated (based on estimates) that we should 
have only purchased about 88,000 from the Liquids group at King Ranch for 
February.  See the following:

Booked to HPLR Liquids: 539,574  18,606/day
Purch by HPLC @ WH:  379,108  13,073/day
Incorrect Liquids Sale:    72,500  2,500/day
     Adjusted purch from Liquids:   87,986  3,034/day


We usually input a purchase of 2,500 Mmbtu/day from HPLR Liquids at the 
tailgate.  We can increase this to 3,000/day for March.

The majority of gas in the 3-Rivers system is transported to the King Ranch 
plant through HGPL.  Some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLC, 
some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLR Liquids, and three 
producers have the option to either sell their gas to HPLC at the wellhead or 
to process their gas and sell the residue to HPLC at the tailgate of the 
plant.  It is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated 
correctly among parties related to these transactions.  The attached schedule 
should assist in doing this.  I have reported the meters at which HPLC buys 
wellhead gas.  The movement of this gas through HGPL and King Ranch should be 
kept seperate from the gas purchased by the Liquids group.  A transport usage 
ticket can be used to show the transfer of HPLC's gas from King Ranch to HPL.

Let's plan on discussing this either Friday or Monday afternoon.  Let me know 
what works best for you.

I know it's first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3/15 (71 
dec.) and 3/23 (35 dec.) but the deal (Sitara #213005) doesn't cover these 
two days.

Can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in Sitara so that I 
can clear my exceptions for Volume Management?

Daren:

During the period of 1/1/2000 to 1/4/2000, the above meter has recorded flow 
on the following days with no deals attached:

 Days     Mmbtus

 1/1/00          3,737
 1/2/00          3,713

 1/4/00             800
      
        11,980

Deal #120891 was at that meter during 12/99 production month, but it expired 
on 12/31/99.  Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL 
Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics needs either (1)  have Deal #120891 
extended, (2) new deal, or (3) approval to writeoff these volumes to 
Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to Clem 
Cernosek).

Please resort the pipeline order on the Texas/HPLC position screen in CPR.  
The current sort makes it difficult for us to manage our trading position

would most benefit us is listed below:

Houston Pipe Line
East Texas Gas System
NNGB
Oasis

Please look into this and let me know of any problems in making these changes.

Rita and Lisa, 

Why don't ya'll get together and determine a range of days/times that would 
work for your groups to have a training session.  (Over lunch or early 
afternoon)  If you are interested, I would like to discuss how we operate the 
HPL system and the processes we go through during the trading day.  To help 
with the discussion, I have maps which highlight the main points and areas 
where we transact.  (There will be a few for you to keep at the desks.)  

I did this with the Logistics group.  I think it went pretty well.  If you 
want to do this, we need to allow 1.5 to 2 hours to talk about everything.  
Let me know.

Can you please extend the deal thru 2-1-00 to cover this small volume?

Thanks
-Jackie-

ENA Gas Assets Group Outing

You have between now and June 6th to practice and get ready.  It's time to 
get in touch with you inner bowler.  That's right, we are going bowling!!!!  
Tuesday, June 6th all of Gas Assets, everyone under Brenda's direction, will 
be going Bowling.  We will depart the Enron building between 2:45 and 3:15 on 
buses (no not the yellow kind) and we head for Dynamic Lanes, where everyone 
will be placed on a team of 4, bowl three games, compete and cheat (just 
joking) for fabulous prizes and then return to the Enron building around 6:00 
pm, just in time to catch buses and go home.

FAQ
Is it mandatory that I go?

No, BUT you will be gravely missed if you are not there, you will be left out 
of all the inside jokes that are sure to come as a result of this event, and 
you run the risk of being ridiculed by your co-workers for not attending.


 If I don't go bowling can I leave work / stop working at 2:45. ?

No.

If I do go does that mean I do not have to return to work to complete 
required daily tasks such as P&L?

No.

These are not spot deals.  PanEnergy did not receive gas on the exchange.  
However, they did deliver gas to us at Cotton Valley.  According to the 
contract, when volumes are overdelivered, HPL buys the gas at GD-.10.  So, in 
order to correctly estimate our economics, I changed the price on the 
delivery to reflect how the deal will settle.  This occurred in August and 
September.  Any spot deals will be on seperate tickets.

Days 5 & 6, as well as 9-31 should be settled as if the exchange was in 
place.  (PanEnergy overdelivered about 7,800 per day, which we buy at Gas 
Daily -.10)

Subject: Duke Energy Field Deal 157288 8/00

Daren:
I am taking over the Duke account from Katherine and am having trouble with 
8/00 production.  It looks like we have some spot deals included in the 
exchange deal 157288.  I think days 9 - 31, which are priced at GD - 0.10, 
need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot.   Let me know if you 
agree.  Also, can you confirm for me that days 8/5 and 8/6 are suppose to be 
exchange?  The sale volume for those two days was zero, so there was no 
exchange.  We have not received any statements from Duke yet, so there is 
nothing to verify our volumes.

You may also want to look at Sept. 2000 for deal 157288.  It looks like spot 
deals are being included in the exchange deal.  Those will need to be moved 
to a new ticket if they are spot.

Thanks,
Megan

You probably haven't had time to look at the Duke Energy price.  When you get 
a chance could you please let me know what the correct price is for May 2000 
production.

Elizabeth,
Sorry, I can't remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what.  
Were you looking into this issue  for me or was it passed to someone else.
Please see the email below.  I believe the system is pulling in the wrong 
price for WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I.. for 5/00 production.  The deal # is 250237.
 I looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $2.95.  
The price of $2.95 plus $1 would equal the price of $2.96 which is what Duke 
is 
claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $3.95.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Elizabeth,
I have a pricing discrepancy and I was not sure if I send this to you or 
Oneil.  
It's for Duke Energy, 5/00 production, deal # 250237.  Duke believes our 
price is too high.  The system downloaded a price of  $3.95 
The price should be WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. , which is $2.95 for that month.  ( 
WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. + 1 ) Duke believes we should have paid them $2.96.
I think the system pulled in the wrong price.  Could you please let me know 
if you handle this pricing issue or someone else?

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

You've got to love idiotic calls, don't you?  An onside kick after you've won 
the game?  What was Barnett  thinking?  

I don't think I'll ever watch another Aggie football game...ohh, the misery.  
I can't handle the emotional rollar coastar.

Anyway, How was Thanksgiving?  Did you make your trip out to pick up the 15 
ft christmas tree?  Or was it bigger this year?  We made the journey to 
Tuscaloosa.  The trip wasn't too bad.  That TV/VCR is a lifesaver.  I ate way 
too much, but it sure was good.  

Hope everthing's going good for you and the family.

Mike, 

You can come down anytime.  The mornings will be the best time to learn, but 
you can spend as much time as you want.  Since things are so crazy, I may not 
be able to answer all of your questions immediately, but can answer them 
later.  I will probably be on vacation next Mon and Fri.  You can start with 
me tomorrow or next Tuesday, it's up to you.  We usually start trading around 
8:30.  We usually start the day at 7:30 with the Gas Control and Weather 
meeting.

Daren,

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a 
general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that 
it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.

I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not 
be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day,  
morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good 
time.  I think it will help me very much in my role.

Thanks.

There is no change in deliveries and redeliveries for tomorrow, but
could someone clarify what the nominations are on the redelivery side?

B, 

I have had the following problems with the recruiting process recently:

1)  After leaving Toni a message stating that I wanted to offer a postion to 
Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to 
interview her.  Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times, 
even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.  Pat Clynes 
fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately 
called Toni to get it straightened out.  Toni called me at home, which is 
good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to 
discuss information with me.

2)  At first, Toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails.  This has 
improved over the last week.  She has called me a couple of times awaiting my 
decision on salary concerns.  So, I think that she is trying to stay on top 
of this now.

Otherwise, I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting.

Hey, Mom.

I got your e-mail just fine.  Is your computer fixed up now?  

Cole had a great time at his birthday party last night.  When we were walking 
out of Chuck E Cheese after the party, Cole asked me "Daddy, am I three 
now?"  He got some good presents and got to play alot of games.  It took him 
forever to go to sleep.  He really loved the Blues Clues game ya'll got him.  
The packaging was coming open when he got it yesterday, so Tonya let him open 
it before the party.  He played it in the car going to the party and on the 
way home.  I think I'm tired of that game.  He can't play it in the car 
anymore.  It so funny to watch him play though.  He will repeat the question 
and go "hmm".  Anyway I need to go.

Subject: displaying 4 digit year on your desktop

In case you were not aware, you have the ability to control the Date display 
format on your PC.  As we approach year 2000, you may wish to see all four 
digits of the year to insure that when you enter '00', the system recognizes 
it as 2000 vs. 1900.  Some of your column widths may need to be expanded to 
view these 2 additional digits.  To do this, go to:

Start/Settings/Control Panel/Regional Settings/Date tab, Short date style.  
You may want to change it from "mm/dd/yy" to "mm/dd/yyyy" then hit OK.

The screen print below may be helpful.  Please forward to others in your area 
that may be interested.  Thanks, d.n.

Hey Daren,

We're back on this issue again.  There is gas out there for days 1-3 and 6-20

Can you assist Anita and I w/a deal number to place the 1st 20 days on.

Daren,

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks

Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you 
please take a look.

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Daren - meter 1601 has flow from 11/8-11/10.  There is no deal for these 
days.  Last deal used was for Oct. - 413538, counterparty Southern Union.  
Will you let me know if you set a deal up for this?

Thanks.

Aimee

Daren - the valve for meter 1031 was not shut off in time on 3/1.  It flowed 
about 1.200.  Could you please extend the deal for one day (deal 589188) ?

The rates are in the system correctly in Unify (so that we can invoice 
correctly), but Daren's group uses a Sitara deal (the transport usage 
tickets) to estimate desk transport in the P&L during the month.  Right now 
we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets.  
Our group has not taken that step, since we have been most concerned with 
settling the G/L (after the month is over).  By not having the right rates on 
the transport usage tickets, the risk is that the P&L will be off during the 
month.  Would we change process and let Daren set up the transport usage 
ticket and then have us enter the rate?  If so, we would need to change the 
process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the 
correct rate.  Please let me know what you want to do.

FYI...the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much 
the marketing desk spent in transport.  They can get their expense numbers 
either from their estimate (from CPR) or from Unify, where we put the rates 
in.

One potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the 
transport capacity tickets, we set up the rates for the transport usage 
tickets.  I am going through the transport usage tickets for February right 
now (as part of the market meter study) and I see some rates I don't tie back 
to Lauri's matrix.  For example, Lauri's matrix shows 0.05 from Thompsonville 
to HSC, but the transport usage ticket (updated by Daren's group) has 0.055.  
This means the economic estimate can be off.  Let me know what you want to do 
with this.

Subject: HPL Noms Files - Did Not Upload

So sorry....

I do not know who exactly to send this email to....

I do not know whose HPL nom files these are.  Whoever was trying to send noms 
to HPL between 4:16pm and 5pm on Thursday 1/20/2000, your noms did not get 
uploaded into POPS.  Please re-send if you have not already.

The production unix machine we process the edi noms on ran out of space.  
When the machine runs out of space, it pages me, but unfortunately no data 
can be saved in the edi files.

I was trying to free up space and after I was done (like 1 hour later, ie. 
6pm), did I notice that these nom files had zero data in them.  Because they 
have zero data in them, I do not know what gas dates or contracts were 
suppose to be in the file which is why I do not know if these are ECT, HPLR, 
HPLC.

We are suppose to get a bigger unix box installed the weekend of 2/5/2000.  
This running our of space has only happened twice in the past year that I 
remember and that it affected the edi processes in some way on those 
occasions.

Call me if you think these files are yours and you need some help in knowing 
how to re-send.

Daren,

I have some flow at the above referenced meter without a deal.  Flow was for 
the first 2 days only, and probably occured as the meter was in the process 
of being shut in.  We purchased the gas from Torch-Rally Partnership in 
Sept.  Can you extend the deal, or should I allocated off to strangers?

Please advise.

Mary

Daren,

Do you know if this deal was supposed to run through 12/00 and 1/01?  It was 
a deal to buy 400 per day from Harman Operating and is currently in for 
11/15/00 to 11/30/00.  Volume management said they are looking for their 
money.

Let me know.  

Thanks.

Daren - meter 1558 has no nom for March.  It has a little over flow on 3/1.  
Could you please extend the deal?  The deal is 604056.  

Thanks.

Rita, 

I think that we have the pricing worked out now with the suppiers.  There 
were some ammendments to the contract, reducing the demand charges, that we 
did not have.  I don't have any contacts at Lone Star related to 
allocations.  Mark's scheduling contacts may help.  Stacey has a trading 
contact with the pipeline.  When she returns tomorrow, I will have her give 
you a call.  The beginning imbalance on Lone Star was around 180,000 owed to 
Lone Star when we took on the management services in October.  Mark should be 
able to get you an exact number if you need it.

Daren,

We are working with Mark McCoy on getting some things repathed in the 
system.  It appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in Unify 
just the deliveries -not sure why????.  We have been paying the suppliers 
based on whatever they invoice us for, which typically has been a smaller 
number than what we have in Unify.  Also, we have not been able to get a 
contact for the allocation statement.  In some cases, we get the summary 
sheet, but no detail and some months we don't get anything at all.  Do you 
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on 
a timely and consistent basis?  The contacts on the allocation statements 
that we do have are not returning phone calls.  I also need to know what was 
the beginning balance when we took this on for Tenaska?   Anything else that 
we need from you, I will call you.

Thanks,
RW

I have reviewed the Entex actuals and adjusted Gas Control's Entex factor for 
the month of May.  I have found that Entex estimates have been overstated by 
approximately 10.0 Mmcf/Day.

Romeo:

Will you make sure the estimates that are in POPs are corrected to reflect 
the new volumes.  This should help reduce some of the UA4 that Daren and Pat 
are trying to locate.  

The attached file has the changes that need to be made.  Please let everyone 
on this mailing list know once the changes have been made.



If you have any questions please call me at 36449.

needs either (1) have some or all of these deals extended, (2) new deal, or 
(3) approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please 
print, sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).

Aimee:

There is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month.  The 
reason for the error is that the deal, # 97929 has expired.  Please determine 
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it?

To fix this I will set up an accounting arrangement but what I need from you 
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to 
put the deal on.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Fred

Thanks again for your prompt attention to this matter, I appreciate it.  

There is a slight problem however, I couldn't find the deals for July and 
November 1999 in Path Manager.  I looked in Sitara and I see where you put 
the deal 269123 in for May 1999, but it is also in for July and November of 
2000.  Did you mean to put the deal in for July and November of 1999 and 
inadvertently put it in for July and November 2000?  If so would you put it 
in for July and November 1999 and send me an e-mail when you are done.  
Thanks,

Meter 5192.  I never heard back from Aimee on which Transport contract to 
attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still 
allocated to the Strangers Gas contract.  Aimee is out on vacation until 
mid-June so I put in a call to Daren Farmer to find out which Transport 
contract I should attach the deal 269123 to.

When I find out which transport contract to use I will set up the accounting 
arrangements and then get Robert Lloyd to put the contract in POPS and 
reallocate.

The meters in question are : 616, 894, 2538, 2690, 3396.

Mtrs 616 and 2538 are shrinkage and condensate meters.  Volumes are split 
among HPLR Liquids and HPLC, with the majority going to Liquids. 
Mtr 894 is a gas loss meter.  Volume should be allocated to our operational 
ua4 contract.
Mtrs 2690 and 3396 should be allocated to Liquids.

You can see these allocations by viewing prior months in POPS.  On Monday 
afternoon, Clem Cernosek will verify the above transactions and expain the 
split between parties at 616 and 2538.

I have identified the additional HPLC wellhead purchases and have made 
corrections to the interconnect tickets accordingly.  Jackie is still having 
difficulty identifying all the wellhead purchase.  We feel there are at least 
6 meters flowing a total of appox. 7000 a day that are not showing up on a 
HPLC purchase or a HPLR transport.  I believe she has given you this 
information and will await instructions or for the purchases to be input 
reflecting the proper Enron Entity purchasing these volumes.

We have worked very hard on this issue and I apologize that it has not yet 
been entirely corrected.

Bob, 

I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated 
during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it 
is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for 
this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

Daren,

Please read this memo and the one dated 2/21/01 from Vance.  He told me all 
new production should be entered at IFHSC.  The deal in question is 634075.  
Do you want it changed to Gas Daily?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob

Tom/Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period  Global No.
HESCO Gathering Co., LLC 9876   85mmbtu/d  100% GD less $0.17  3/13 - 3/31 
96057368

FYI, Susan will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of April.  Additionally, 
this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,

Mom, 

That sounds good.  You can bring the curtains when you come.  What time do 
you think you can make it down here on Friday?  We will probably be leaving 
farily early to go to the rodeo (about 5:00).  We can have the girl across 
thestreet take care of Cole until you get there.

Daren:

During the period of 9/5/99 thru 9/6/99, the above meter recorded flow of 
3,962 Mmbtus.  There was no deal at this meter the month prior or after.  
Currently, Logistics has these volumes recorded to HPL Strangers Gas 
Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either a deal to 
record these volumes which have flowed into HPL's pipeline or Logistics needs 
approval to writeoff these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, 
sign, and return the original to Clem Cernosek).

Sandi, 

Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.  

The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on CPI.

Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do 
you agree with this?

Subject: Rate for  Tenaska Deal

Daren,
When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me 
how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year? 
based on what index?

Thanks,
Sandi

Jackie and Stella, 

I need ya'll to get together and work out how to handle this at Stratton.  I 
know that we get the estimated volume from Exxon daily and I would think that 
this volume will need to be allocated among the different deals.  But, Exxon 
will not have them broken out.

Bill Moore called this morning and said he sent in a nomination change for 
the 15th on for meter 989826.  He would like to go from 1100 to 1250.  The 
daily meter volumes are ranging for the month from 1164 to 1334 Bill feels 
the 1250 will be the avg. Let me know what you think Daren.  thanks.

Tom, 

For the EOG piece, bring the nom down to 4400 through the 7th.  For the 8th 
forward, leave the nom as is.  When we get more information next week, we can 
adjust as necessary.

Yates - What did they produce in Jan and Feb?  Let me know that and we can 
decide if we want to adjust the nom. 

Vintage - Adjust our nom to tie with Vintage.

 Daren,  EOG  is having problems with that same well 6296 but this time it's 
compressor problems.  They think that it will be for at least a week but you 
know how that goes.  They would like to drop the volume again to 4400.  If we 
change don't Kim will have an imbalance at this meter (she wanted me to let 
you know that).  Meter # 6598 YATES  would like to change the volume from 
4206 to 3366, and Vintage who had been over producing last month would like 
to increase from 270 to 320 to match the real flow.  I know these are 
bothersome changes but I'm trying to get the best numbers for both you and 
Vance for the up coming month.  Let me know and I'll be on the go  from the "

Charlotte, 

This is a desk-to-desk deal.  You need to get with the scheduler on the East 
Desk who handles Transco.  Both desks will need to tie in MOPS.  In this 
case, POPS most  likely tried to update the HPL side, but the East Desk has 
not adjusted their side in MOPS.

Susan,

Please see the attached file for January's production estimate.  This is 
pretty much the final estimate except that I have calls in to Costilla &  
Walter (Superior).  They both said that they would fax their nom once it was 
complete.  Hopefully this will be by Monday.  If not, all of the traders have 
reviewed the estimate and made their changes.  I feel pretty confident that 
this is a good number.  However, if your should receive any noms before 
Monday at noon, please update the file and send it to Carlos and Daren.

Thanks and Merry Christmas to you and yours!

Hey Ken,

Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you, but...We've had an 
interesting couple of weeks here.  Craig Faulbaum has taken personal some 
time off (I think that this is the 4th week).  So, we have picked up his 
trades.  Tom restructured the EOL trading.  Carey has gone to Gas Daily and I 
have taken over the Waha trading for an interim period.  (I'm still 
responsible for our overall position, but Ami is watching it during 
trading.)  In other words, everyone on my desk is doing double duty.  And, of 
course, Tom expects nothing to fall through the gaps (not cracks, anymore).  
He has two opening on the trading side that we (Stacey and I) are filling.  I 
don't know if he has even interviewed anyone yet.  I am getting very 
frustrated with the whole business.  It doesn't see that he even appreciates 
the amount of time and stress we are going through to pick up his slack.  
Wheww...That feels a little better... getting some of that off my chest. 

Anyway, Tonya is very uncomfortable.  I think that baby is going to come 
along any day now (due date is still 3/18).  We are both definitely ready.  
The desk is really going to be in a fix when I'm out with that.  That's just 
too bad.  (I half expect Tom to ask me to come in some.  I've got a real 
quick answer to that.)

How are things at home?  Linda doesn't have you working too much does she?  I 
just bought the materials to put a sprinkler system in our front yard.  If 
things get weak on your stock trading, I've got some trenches you can dig for 
extra cash!  It shouldn't be too bad, I bought a brand new sharp-shooter.  
(Of course with a new shovel, I'd have to knock some off of your hourly pay.)

The grant price on the employee options is $55.50.

I hope everything is going good for you.  I would like to have lunch with you 
sometime.  I will let you know when things work out here, so that we can do 
that.  Or...I can give you a call when I'm out for paternity leave and we can 
go one day then.  Talk to you later.

Hey, Ken.

Well, I don't know what I'm going to do.  We will have a Texas Desk, but I 
don't really want to continue here.  I may look into Brenda's group (Pulp, 
Paper, Lumber, Steel).  I will most likely interview with AEP to see what 
they have to offer, but it has to be very good in order for me to leave the 
Evil Empire.  I am just glad they finally anounced the sale.  Some folks are 
upset and concerned about the whole deal, but I'm glad it's happened.

Anyway, I meant to let you know how our Christmas went with the boys.  Cole 
loved everything.  He had a great time and was sad to see Christmas come to 
an end.  Jake is a little different.  We spent $60 on a couple of things for 
him.  He hasn't touched them more than twice.  He found his new favorite toy 
the day after Christmas:  it's one of those soft cooler things you carry your 
lunch in.  He found that in the bottom of our pantry and now carries it 
around everywhere.  Now we have these two big plastic things just taking up 
more room in our already crowded house.

We started our house hunting last week.  I think this is going to be a long 
process.  Tonya's out looking today.  I'm letting her make the first cut.  I 
will come in on the second round.  We will probably put our house on the 
market in a couple of weeks.  We have a few small things we want to clean up, 
fix, etc., before we list it.  According to the other sales in the 
neighborhood, we should make a little money.

I hope everything is going well with you and the family.  

Later.

Hey, I spoke with Ronnie Skerrik and Charlie Stone this morning and they 
agreed that 
if Lonestar does not bring the gas back to HPL as nomed that the gas will 
continue to be 
sold to TXU.   This should elevate any higher vol re-deliveries/Make up to 
HPL.

Please call me with any questions,

I don't know what PC 12667 is.  But, in the attached spreadsheet, my cost 
center is grouped with Risk Management.  I now report to Bob Hall, so CC 
105633 should be reported with the other Logistics groups.

Hi Daren,

I'm afraid I don't understand what you are asking me to do.  Do you mean that 
you want CC 105633 moved to Logistics PC 12667.  If so, there is a 
complicated process in order to do so.  Has someone else made this request or 
is this your own?  Please explain.

Thank you,

Attached is a revised allocation file for October.  Please note that the 
format of this file has been changed to reflect the new team reporting list.  
Also, "Global Markets" and "Industrial Markets" have been broken out for 
billing purposes.  If you have cost centers that are allocating to either of 
these teams, please provide a breakdown of those percentages by Monday, 
November 6th.

All other allocations are due by end of day today.

I have also included the team reporting list that is currently in use until 
the end of 2001. 

Thank you for your help.  Please call if you have any additional questions.

Subject: Lone Star Points

Daren, there were several points on your list that were previously created 
and the remainder have been created, with the exception explained below.

Donna and I researched your list and identified the ones that were on system 
(which she would create) and the ones that were off system (which I would 
create).

Standard Pooling Stations and West Texas (Line X) Pooling Stations had no 
meters, so they are not set up.  I will try to find the meter numbers for 
these locations.  I don't think we will be using them much.  So, it may be a 
few days before I get the info together.

The Hunt Fairway Plant (17-8477-01) was previously created as (178477), I 
need to know if the (01) needs to be added.  Please add the 01.

We need to verify HPL - Texoma (17-0973-13), it is set up as (17097613).  Is 
this the same point???  This is the same point.

Please let Donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red.


Thanks,
Faye

Daren - I need your help in resolving this issue.  There wasn't any deal in 
OSS for the above reference meter, nor could I find anything in CPR.  The 
contract shows 089-41500-102 representing a sale in the amount of 9448.

Deal 93485 has meter 7268 attached to it.  You can apply the flow to this 
deal.  You may need to renom from MOPS to POPS to get it through the systems.

Kim/Anita-

A volume of 7247mm shows to have been allocated to the Reliant 201 contract 
for November.  There was no nomination for Reliant at this point in November 
and, therefore, there should be no volume allocated to their contract.  
Please make sure these volumes are moved off the Reliant contract prior to 
November close.

Thanks.

Daren,


This is one of the deals which you told me to zero out.  Unfortunately, I do 
not allocate PGEV.  Also,  Sherlyn has actualized PGEV and she has the 
support from the pipeline for the 1746918 volume.  Please let me know if I 
had missed something in our conversation.  Thanks

Thu

Hey, Byron.

We may be interested in your sofa.  Send me the pictures when you get a
chance.  Now that we are moving, we've got a few empty rooms.  Thanks.

Hello friends,

Leslie and I have a sleeper sofa, a real sturdy and heavy one, that we are
wanting to get rid of.  It has a very comfortable bed and would be great
for
an extra room in the house.  It is in great condition other than some cat
claws in the arms...done before I cut out the claws.

I have pictures I can e mail if you are interested.  We will give it away
or
sell it to the highest bidder!

Byron

I finally heard back from Duke regarding Sept 2000.  They agree with our 
spreadsheet, so I need a demand fee to adjust the price in Sitara.

Deal 157288 - demand fee of ($8,745.69)

Pat, 

You should have been included on this.  I probably won't go to these meetings 
since I won't be dealing with Unify much in the future.  I don't mind going 
with you for the first couple of times if you need me to, though.

Subject: CILCO STORAGE

The Cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to Cilco.  Please 
review the attached the spreadsheets from Lisa Kinsey, the central desk 
scheduler responsible for the Cilco account.  The biggest variance is in 
January 2000.  Cilco withdrew 200,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel.  
Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.  I suspect the 
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.  Also, the nomination for 
the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.  7,000 is 
the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel.

I recevied a note from Janet Wallis stating that we need Gas Daily deals for 
imbalances at Colorado River Station (Mtr 8663) for Nov 99 and Mar 00.  I 
changed the pricing on the term deal 72349 to Gas Daily + .199 to cover these 
flows.

HC - Please have someone allocate the needed volumes to this deal ticket for 
these two months, and let Katherine know when completed.

Let me know if you have any questions.

The deal with Oxy Vinyls (#276478) will covers the volume for all of 
October.  We had zero in the system after the 6th because the plant was

Daren,

A sale to Oxy Vinyls went into effect 10/01 through 10/16 for 5,000 per day.  
We also delivered gas to Entex, 10,000/day for the entire month.  More gas 
was pulled towards the end of the month than confirmed and I need to know if 
Oxy Vinyls should get the swing for the remaining of the month even though 
their deal went to zero.  Please advise.

JM, 

The message below is related to deal #138094.  According to Joan, October is 
the last month for this deal.  However, the evergreen flag is activated in 
Sitara and a new line has been created for November.  Can you look into this 
please?

Stella:

I set up the accounting arrangement on the HPLR transport contract

The tracking ID for all 6 months is 34500.

I also set up accounting arrangement on the HPLC transport contract 
012-41500-02-015 for July per Daren's instructions below.  The tracking ID 
for July is 34501.  If you would, please put the transport contract in POPS 
on Monday morning and call me when your done so that I can reallocate the 
meters.  I need to call Copano to tell them that their payment is on the way.

I need the transport contracts, HPLR and HPLC put in for all 31 days of each 
of the respective months.

As always thanks in advance for your help,

Daren:

I looked in Path Manager and I see two deals - 93480 and 93481, but I don't 
see deal 69176 for July forward that you mentioned below.  Also, please 
verify that the deal for January through June is 93481 and if the 69176 deal 
is correct for July forward.


Stella:

I will need to set up accounting arrangements for these deals from January 
forward.  From Daren's note below it appears that for January through June I 
will need an HPLR transportation contract put in POPS.  When Daren and I get 
the deal number issue resolved for July forward I will need an HPLC contract 
put into POPS.  Also for July forward, I will need the HPLC contract in POPS 
every month through December to allocate Copano line gain to if it occurs.

Thanks to both of you,

Fred

Fred, 

I have pathed the purchase from Copano for 1999 in MOPS.  Jan-Jun is under 
HPLR (Sitara 93481).  July forward is under HPLC (Sitara 69176).  I 
understand that I cannot renom this to the pipe for prior months, because the 
callout allocations will be affected.  So, you will need to set up accounting 
arrangements to get the nom into POPS.

Let me know if you have any questions.

#69176 for HPLR and #93481 for HPLC- but they have zero volume and were not

Stella:

I need the above referenced contract put into POPS for January, May, June , 
July, and August 1999 forward.  I need the contract in POPS for August 
forward because I never know when Copano will allocate line gain to itself.

In 1998 a spot contract was set up between HPLR and Copano Pipeline/South 
Texas, L. P. with a Synergi contract number 078-62210-101 and a Global number 
of 96016880 by Karen Lambert.  Per Karen this old agreement was terminated by 
Dan Hyvl due to HPLR business change to ECT.  In 1999, when Copano began 
allocating line gain to themselves again I contacted Lauri, Karen, and 
yourself to see if I could get the contract in POPS.  Karen sent me an e-mail 
indicating that she set-up a new contract for this HPLC line gain purchase - 
Global # 96022367 (I don't have a "Synergi" contract number).  I know that in 
3/99 Lauri contacted Bernard Widacki at Copano to discuss this issue.

I need Lauri to review this and then I need the contract to be put in POPS so 
that I can correctly allocate the gas at this meter.  I have not allocated 
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small.  Karen is the most 
knowledgeable about this contract, so I suggest that any questions be 
directed to her regarding contract issues.  Karen worked with Bernard Widacki 
at Copano to set up the contract originally.

Thanks,

Fred

George-

In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the 
referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well 
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing 
approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may 
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month.

Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently 
show on this?  It's being purchased for SC-.17 and is flowing through King 
Ranch.  

Thanks.

return some evenings.  If you need anything, you can leave me a voice mail or 
call Liz and Stacey.

Subject: Midcon Transport Usage Tickets --Mar01

Daren---

I noticed that the Midcon transport usage tickets at Oakville & Moore are not 
in for March.  The previous deal tickets are 598934 & 598958 for that 
transport.  Should they?  Let me know if you want me to set up new tickets if 
need be...or let me know if you create them, so I can update MOPS & POPS.  

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: 75th Anniversary Celebration

Thank you for your fantastic responses to our reservations request.  There 
has been some confusion concerning the Dinner Only option.  If you are 
planning to spend the night, you do not need to respond to that option.  It 
is listed only for those who do not plan to spend the night.   

We are preparing name tags for all the employees invited to the HPL 
Anniversary Celebration.  Please email me with the name you would like to 
appear on your nametag, such as nicknames, etc.   If we do not hear from you 
by Wednesday, August 2, we will use the name as it appears in the list we 
acquired from HR.  Please print this memo for any employees who do not have 
access to email.

Thank you so much for your help.

I forgot to get with you this morning on this.  I went ahead and changed the 
volume to 24,000.

Thanks.   
Also, Rohm & Haas, meter 1506, is looking for 24.000 for Feb. instead of 
27.000.  They take the swing.  Would you like me to change the deal or keep 
it as is?

Daren - I am looking for 5.000/d at meter 1394 and 10.000/d at meter 8018 for 
Feb.   Currently it is 10.000/d at 1394 and 5.000/d at 8018.  Can I change 
the tickets or will you?  Attached is the confirmation spreadsheet from 
Valero.

Thanks.

Sandi, 

Do you have a complete contract for the Apache purchase under the Tenaska IV 
deal?  Apache is billing us a rate that is $.11 below the commodity rate 
stated on page 22 in the original contract.  In the documents I have, I can't 
find a reason for the adjustment.  I may be missing an amendment or 
something.  I thought that you may have a complete set of documents and could 
help me out.

Daren

Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may 
need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.

I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.

Lee,

On Saturday, April 1st, Lubrizol will cut over natural gas supply from Enron
to Coral at Lubrizol's Bayport plant.

In order to accomplish cut over activities, we will need a technical
representative(s) from Enron at Lubrizol's Bayport plant to participate in
the activities and to insure Enron's interests and assets are protected.

Would you please make arrangements to have an Enron technical
representative(s) report at 12:00 noon, April 1st, to the Main Guard House
at Lubrizol's Bayport plant and ask for Lubrizol's David Massigill.  David
is coordinating all the cut over operations.

If you have any questions about this, please contact me (at the numbers
indicated below) or David Massigill at (281) 479-2851, ext 2511.

Thanks and best regards.

Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related 
to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going 
a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the 
majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading 
arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda 
rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the 
week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay 
balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split 
into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, 
with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  
It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things 
to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The 
kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to 
turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was 
too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides 
down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow 
bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off 
or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the 
way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets 
right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe 
you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next 
couple of days.

Subject: Duke purchase on 8/2/00

Daren,
Deal 351653 is set up for 20,000mmbtu purchase from Duke at meter 981040 on 
HPL, but the actuals on CENT show a volume of 19,606 mmbtu at meter 77455 on 
8/2/00  with no deal set up.  Should this sale to Mobil have taken place on 
CENT  instead of HPL?

Mike, 

I don't know of any deals that were negotiated for this delivery.  So, why 
don't you check with Gas Control to see if they know why vol was delivered on 
that day.  I would think that they had to send someone out there to make it 
happen.  Additionally, you can check with Gary Lamphier or Lee Papyoti to see 
if they made a deal with the plant.

Daren,

The above meter recorded a flow on Jan 15 this year.  It has not had any 
activity all the way back through 1999.  I checked with Cheryl Jones and the 
flow is good.  It was apparently turned on for that one day.  Do we need to 
put in a deal for this flow?  

Thanks.

Also, we had a transport nom from Texaco into King Ranch, so we will have 
adequate flow into Stratton.

This was a weekend deal with Mirant.  On your spreadsheet, the volume shows 
4429.  This is also the volume that I confirmed with Mirant.  The deal is in 
Unify for 5429.  Could you please check and let me know which volume is good.

To forecast Entex:

We have a database that contains the citygate volumes by day, with the low 
and high temps for each day.  When we get a weather report for the new day, 
we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file.  The database 
is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides 
an average volume for that criteria.  (For example:  With temps of 40-60, the 
sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 38 
to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 22 degrees.  An average is 
then calculated from that volumetric data.  In this case, the average is 
calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.)  Upon calculating the average, we then apply 
information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate.  
Things to consider:  if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry;  wind chill;  
Entex's obligation on Midcon;  Entex's recent operating procedures;  Entex 
takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating 
volumes each day), etc.

Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor to 
estimate the remaining 70%.  If we have an unaccounted volume for a few days 
that is fairly consistent (and we have determined that the ua4 has not been 
caused by something else), we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates 
more in line.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Daren

High zeros...?  Is that similar to going flatter?

Earl - I have a meter with flow and no nom.  Meter 1225 (Ingleside Plant 
Brandywine) has flow from 2/14 thru 2/25.  Are these valid volumes or high 
zeroes?  Please let me know what you find out.

Rob, 

I got your name from Doug Leach.  He  thought that you would be the person to 
talk to about this.

I got a call last night from Rudolph Maldonado.  (The operator forwarded him 
our way.)  He stated that he has some natural gas to sell in Saudi Arabia.  
His number is 562-866-1755.  Could you give him a call and check this out?  I 
told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.

I can be reached at 3-6905 if you have any questions.

Daren Farmer

Daren,

I have 2 allocation exceptions that require a deal to be extended.  Meter 
98-1488 Tenaska is showing small volumes flowed on days there was no deal.  
Can you extend the deal throughout the month so that the volumes will have a 
deal to link to.    I have the same situation on meter 98-1601.

If you have any questions, please let  me know.

Thanks,

Susan

  Do you want to arrange a buyback for this activity. There is a buyback 
ticket { # 148381} available

  I am being told this interconnect will be down 2-weeks; effective March

HEY! Tonya said to staple copy B of the W-2 to the tax return--But on the
one from camp it says Copy C for payer or State Copy, Copy B for Recipient
(Keep for your records).  So which one do I send?  The one from the school
says send B but I'm confused on the other one.
What did the doctor say about Tonya & the due date? Love, Ma

Deal #276494 ended June 15, but there is additional flow on meter #9602 from

This transport ticket should have been entered under ENA, instead of HPL.  
However, the pathing in Unify is correct.  HPL sold 30,000 on th 15th to ENA, 
who then transported it to mtr 628 on Oasis for .015.

Hi Mark!

Another interconnect issue - 7/99:

Can you please take a look at deal 109660?  It is set up with a transport 
usage ticket, however is a brokered deal.  I am not sure if it is pathed 
incorrectly or if possibly the deal is set up incorrectly.  

Let me know your thoughts.

not.  If it does not work, I can put the demand on the sale ticket.

Tom, 

Please handle this.  The deal is already out there for this time period.  You 
will probably need to send a zero nom.

Daren - During the Saxet Thompsonville outage, May 8 - May 11, the meter 
flowed a small volume with no nom.  Can you set up a deal for the days that 
flowed?

 5/8 .012
 5/9 0
 5/10 .087
 5/11 6.970

Katherine, 

There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into Sitara:
1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.

2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.  I 
can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara.

Let me know how you want to handle it.

Why don't you come to the office around 11:00.  (I'll be trading Waha until 
10:30 or so.) You can come up and say "hi" to everyone.  Or, we can just meet

Darren,

How are things going?  Just a note to reiterate what we talked about 
yesterday.  Rick Hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee 
was for an outside counterparty.  This admin fee would be for the life of the 
project (through 2019).   Also, Mike Mazowita should be calling you to talk 
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

Scotty/Richard,

Our DBAs would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in 
Contract_Event_Status.  We have over 1 Gig of data in that table.  I would 
like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any 
row with a Last_Mod_Date over a month (or two) old.  So if someone balances 
February 1999 this month, we will keep it around for a month (or two).

Does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter/longer period 
of time?

This is not an audit table.  This is just a "log" every nom/track/balance/EDI 
send/Fax send/sched qty/quick response since the beginning of time.

d.n.

Robert,

I've taken care of 98-6719 (as far as getting it out of my allocation 
exception screen).  I'm going to place 98-9676 on Strangers Gas until you 
hear back from Daren or Julie.

Should Daren or Julie get back w/you, while I'm on vacation, please get back 
w/Anita Luong and provide her with the K # given to you (by Daren or Julie) 
as well as the dates of 2/1 - 2/29 (even though 3/1/2000 is reflected in my 
allocation exception screen) so that she can provide you with an accounting 
arrangement to place February's volumes on @ this meter.

It looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3/1/2000.  I guess that the 
trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter.

Thanks

Hi Daren,

Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters 
can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so 
that Anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me?

98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the deal 
is not effective until  February the 11th.
     No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the 
gathering (96026573) K which is the only
     K @ the meter.

98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is 
flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/2000 
production which is the only K @ the meter.


Thanks

Stella and Charlotte, 

I looked into this deal.  We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the 
path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated 
and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a 
bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified that 
the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy 
should have been found before we closed out January.

I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id 
in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).  
This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group, 
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not the 
problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an 
explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas 
was confirmed for the 27th-31st.

Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the 
OBA.  Unless you can find a missing transport contract.

D

Joanie,

Logistics is waiting to hear from Daren on this issue.  He will either need 
to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place.   This 
deal 155118 is valid on 1/26/00 only, but the rest of the volume you are 
looking for is scheduled on days 1/27 - 1/31.    I am sure there is no 
pricing on those days.  

I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.

FYI - we will probably be asked what historical information is needed in our 
shop from a Logistics perspective. I would suggest asking the new CES 
employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal 
with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as 
well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer 
and asset transactions. 

Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to 
the IT folks.

Subject: Columbia Energy History Data

The following summarizes the decisions made during our  user & IT joint 
meeting today regarding the handling of CES historical data.

A.  Bryce Baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify CES reports 
that need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that 
will be accessed               via the Electronic Document Management system.
B.  Jeff Peoples will be working with Bryce Baxter to produce reports using 
CES system via ISDN line at Enron building - this will continue to be part of 
his duty until  the job is done (Jeff joined ENA as a member of Sitara group).
C.  Larry Daze will be working with Jeff Peoples and Bryce Baxter to ensure 
all reports are loaded on our EDMS with proper indexing.
D.  No need for manupulating CES history data is necessary  (i.e. downloading 
on spreadsheets).  Therefore, no data will be kept on the disk other than 
EDMS.

The following seminar will be given several times this year.  The 
distinguished list of speakers is as follows:

   Bryan Hull
   Chad Landry
   Tim Blanchard
   Bob Cotten

A cameo appearance will be made by Dr. Mick Walters, esq.  Of course, this 
seminar will be moderated by Yours Truly.  

Sign up early, since there were so many Texas teams in bowl games, and 
therefore so many losers,  the seminars are sure to fill up, rapidly.  

P. Love - I am sure it is little consolation, but at least you covered.

     
     P.S. Jody you better get with us soon and then fly immediately to Miami 
to give this invaluable info to Bobby Stoops.

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 
2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting 
spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353  Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258  Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11



I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser 
ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we 
do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that 
only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just 
going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so 
you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

   Good Morning!  

   I was wondering if you all would be interested in going in together to buy 
a 
   gift for Bob Hall.   I have picked out a little something that I thought 
he would 
   like for home or office.  Take a look and tell me what you think, asap.  

   This is completely optional, I thought it might help some of you (like me) 
who 
   have no idea what to get him.  If we all went in on it, it would cost us 
$17.00 each.


   

Description below for the  Audiovox Slimline CD Player & Radio

Slimline Radio w/ CD Player - with FREE shipping
Price: $119.00
 
This complete audio system can sit on a swivel base or be mounted on the wall 
as a convenient space saver. The ultra slim design features CD and cassette 
players 
as well as an AM/FM radio and remote control. 16?"L x 12 7/8"H x 6?"D.

Thanks for the info! 

As Greg mentioned in the staff meeting today, the intent is that this 
restructured deal is papered effective 4/1/00.  The impact is potentially 
that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate 
transport/gathering agreements, etc.  If any rates are changing, then those 
need to be changed in our systems also.  There may be other areas of changes 
also - I'm not attempting to list them all.  Rather I just want to make 
people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations.

Thanks for the information.

Pat/Daren:  Can you get with Mike and/or Brian to determine the potential 
impact, if any?  Thanks.

Brenda,

Per your request, attached are the Draft documents which will be used to 
finalize the new  Gathering Arrangment between HPL and Coastal, the revenue 
sharing arrangement between Exxon and HPL (Transaction Agreement) and the 
Residue Gas Purchase Agreement between Coastal, as Seller and HPL as Buyer 
(Amendment to Wellhead purchase agreeement).  

I do not have a copy of the Processing Agreement between Exxon and Coastal, 
as such agreement does not involve us (and I believe it is far from 
finalized. The only other document that I plan to prepare is a termination 
agreement relative to the current Liquifiables Purchase Agreement between 
Exxon as purchaser and HPL as seller--this termination will be affective as 
of 4/1/2000.

If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know.


Steve

Just a little explanation on what you're seeing.

 We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take 
excess volumes over the base nom.  We have been estimating the overtakes each 
day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we 
can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.  So, Equistar is within 
their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual 
doesn't reflect this.  This occurs with a few of our industrial points.

Robert,
There is a large variance between noms and flow at this meter.  Is everyone

Daren,

I'm trying to put together the 2001 Operating Budget for the plant.  I need a 
conservative forecast, per month, of the price that could be obtained by 
selling our excess volumes. 

Thanks.

There is a drab of gas; 34 MM's on the first of August on the meter.  
Probably from valving off.  The above ref'd deal was from Jul, do you want to 
extend it for one day?  Let me know.

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)  

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

This is the deal we made for El Paso last Friday to replace deal 235670, 
which had Teco.  Julie Meyers needs a price to be added to the deal.  Which 
price should I add?
