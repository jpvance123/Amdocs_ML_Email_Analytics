Hey!  The draft date has been set for Wednesday Sept. 5th @ 5:30 @ Dirty's
on Durham/ I-10.  Just some quick points.  This years entry fee is $200
payable to me (for you check writers) on the day of the draft.  Out of the
$200, $5 will go to me for the purchase of the stats and system upkeep and
the other $195 will go into the pot.  So the pot will start out at $2730.00
and should climb over the $3000 mark by the end of the year.  Last year we
had 75 transactions for a total of $375.  I think with the amount of money
involved this year that we might see the transaction total get to 100+.  We
are going to change the scoring system around a little bit.  I am going to
update the system and then I will send out a copy to all of you in the next
day or two.  We will get points for yards gained and not the century mark,
i.e 1 point for every 15 yards rushing or receiving and 1 point for every
50 yards passing.  We will not go to any negative based scoring system.
The vote was pretty much unanimous on that point.  We have one spot still
available.  Let me know if any of you have someone in mind.  I would prefer
that they are able to be at the draft.  We have 5 newcomers this
year.......WELCOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think that you will
find this to be one of the best Fantasy Leagues that you have been in.  Out
of the 6 teams that we lost 4 made the play-offs.  Will this open the door
for the weak teams that stayed around for another beating?  We will see.
Please call me at 713-207-1493 or email me if you have any questions or
concerns.  You will receive more info in a day or two.
Late!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dear Joe:

	Pursuant to our conversation of today's date, you have cancelled a
scheduled appointment which was intended for the preparation of Wednesday's
hearing on Tonya's Special Appearance and Plea to the Jurisdiction.  Your
preparation for this hearing is absolutely critical for any chance of
retaining your case in Texas.  You further indicated that you would not
reschedule the appointment for anytime prior to the hearing and gave me no
indication of your intentions.

	You and your mother have both expressed displeasure in your
representation in this case.  It is apparent to me that this is no longer a
productive working relationship.  Our inability to communicate in a
productive manner and your refusal to participate in the preparation of your
case lead me to only one conclusion.  I must withdraw from your
representation in this matter.

	I will be forwarding to you this afternoon a Motion to Withdraw as
your counsel of record.  It is my intention to present the motion to the
trial Court prior to the hearing on July 18, 2001.

Thanks, Joe.  I will check back with you after the 19th.  The resume I sent highlights more of my PR skills and background, but I don't want to limit my opportunities.  I would also be interested in potential marketing and/or marketing communications opps.  Thanks again!!

Hi Joe-
I am Suzette's friend-the one looking for jobs (on the sly of course) in the greater Tampa and/or St. Petersburg area.  She had suggested I send my resume to you for potential contacts at FPL and Bank of America.  

I am currently in the associate program but have a 'unique' concentration.  I was hired into the marketing track and have focused mainly on those areas here at Enron.  Let me know if you have any questions for me-here's a recent copy of my resume which includes my latest rotation.  Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards,

Stewart, Joe would like to talk to Tonya before she leaves Houston to set up
a dialog and line of communication to help facilitate further communication
between them. He will need her phone number where by he can call her in
Florida. He also wants to see his child and is most anxious to see his son
as soon as possible. either this weekend on no later then next. I don't see
the need for supervised possession under the currents situation as was
suggested in you earlier arrangement.   I would like to set up a formal
program for routine possession hopefully before she leaves. Please call me .

Joe, I really appreciate your offer to forward my resume to your father at FPL.  I forwarded my resume to Irma Sulaiman @ FPL yesterday in response to a job posting in yesterday's Houston Chronicle.

The position, "Energy Trader", calls for at least 1-3 years of experience in fuels, energy marketing or energy trading; all of which I have experience in.

Below is the cover letter and resume that I e-mailed yesterday.  Again, I truly appreciate you helping me out!

<<<<Cover Letter>>>>

I would like to express my interest in the "Energy Trader" position posted in the Houston Chronicle, Sunday, December 2, 2001.

I have been trading power at Enron for the U.S. Eastern Interconnect and am very familiar with all facets of executing hourly and daily trades, including the utilization of trading tools and indices for all energy commodities.

I have over nine years of related experience and have also received my MBA during my four-year tenure at Enron.  My experience ranges from petroleum terminal management, refining and wholesale marketing, fuel management, pipeline and vessel/barge scheduling; liquefied natural gas (LNG); and trading power for the U.S. Eastern Interconnect power grid.

My attached resume illustrates an intense level of vertically integrated experience and knowledge of the energy business.  I believe that my vast experience and advanced education could be of great benefit to your company.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss career options with someone at your company.

Sincerely,

Dustin Collins

Dear Joe:
 
I just received a phone call from Miryam  Mitchell.  She said if you would like to take Payton to Vero Beach on  Saturday, November 3rd, you may have him from 12:00 to 7:00, if you are willing  to forego visitation on Sunday and let Tonya have him all day on  Sunday.
 
If you'd prefer this, let me know.  It  is your call.

Per our conversation today you wanted to know what  I propose, there are only a few things. I would like us to follow the law as closely as  possible:
 
    1)    I  want per Texas law you to pay what your requested in child support, so  in the future there will be no discrepency.  Paid                 through the Clerk of  Court in Harris County.  
    2)    I  would like to follow the visitation guidelines that Miram provided to me.   I am willing to work with you to make it more                       convenient (with  Payton's best interest in mind).
    3)     I still  propose that you pay my attorney fees.  During your Orlando visit on July  28th with Payton you  stated, 
            "You wanted to do whatever you needed to do to make me happy because then you  knew Payton would be  happy."                      This would make me  happy and it would help me to provide for Payton the best I  can.
    4)    I am  willing to cooperate with your family in scheduling visits within reason with  Payton.
    5)    In  Orlando on July 29th you asked if I could bring Payton to New Orleans for your  Uncles wedding..I told you would think                  about it.   After careful consideration I feel that at Payton's age that will not be a wise  decision.
 
These are the issues that I can think of right  now.  Once you provide me with a proposal I will let you know  if anything else comes to mind.  I feel by both parties following the  Texas law it will work in everyones best interest.

Hey Joe.

Enron is a great company.  I need you working hard for me!  Our interests
are aligned.

Have a good trip to Fla.  I hope your boy is doing well.

It is the same here.  Everyone looking out for themselves.  (and the copier
still breaks down making the morning packet.)

Cliff wants to know if you can make it to the bowling the first weekend in
Dec.

Tim

Good Morning Tim,

Well, I guess you and Bill were right!  About Enron...

You should see this place everyone is so down.  What do you think about
our situation?  I'm not sure what to make of it.  People are starting to
leave.

Anyway, I'm going home again tomorrow.  This going home every two weeks
is starting to take its toll but I have to do it.  We are not getting
along so it makes this worse.
Well I hope thinks are going good for you.  Please tell everyone I said
hello.

Dear  Joe:
 
See the attached email  from Miryam Mitchell at Stewart Gagnon's office.  Please let me know if you  agree to their suggested visitation times.  If you need to fly out earlier  on Sunday which would prevent you having him until 4:00, I'll explain that to  Miryam and suggest 1:00 to 7:00 on Saturday and 1:00 to 3:00 on Sunday.  Or  1:00 to 6:00 on Saturday and 12:00 to 3:00 on Sunday.  Let me know which  you prefer.
 
It appears that Tonya is  willing to give you increased access to Payton as he gets older and as he gets  to know you better.  I know this has been a frustrating process for  you.  I think (it is not my legal opinion since I'm not an attorney) that  it would be beneficial to request an extra hour or two at each visitation so  that we work up to overnights.  I know it can't be soon enough for you, but  small steps are always an improvement in the right  direction!!
 
Let me know about the  visitation and where you want to meet Tonya.  At your hotel?  Will you  be taking him out of Merritt Island?
 
Jonda

Jonda,
 
Tonya does not agree to  1 - 8 on Saturday and also from 1 - 3 on Sunday.
 
However, she's willing  to make a compromise suggestion as follows:
 
The visitation on   Saturday from 1 - 4 and again from 6 - 8 is a total of 5 (five) hours.   Rather than Joe having to  pick up Payton twice and deliver him twice on Saturday, Tonya  suggest that Joe take Payton from 1:00 to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, and again from  1:00 to 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.
 
She would also like  written confirmation of exactly where Joe wants to meet to pick up Payton and  exactly where he will deliver Payton back to her.
 
Tonya also like to know, if Joe accepts the  5-hour visitation on Saturday, whether Joe intends to take Payton outside  of Merritt Island, and if so where.  It is not her intent to prevent Joe's  doing so, she simply wants to know if Payton is going to be traveling out of  town.
 
Can we agree on the  foregoing?

Hi Joe -
This is Marcy. Tim forwarded your email to me at home. WOW! We had not heard

the news but are very happy you let us know! How's fatherhood?? Sounds like
you have your hands full traveling back to Orlando every 2 weeks, but it's
well worth it. We wish you the best of luck and would love to see a picture
of Payton if you have one to spare. Our address is 133 Cherry Hill Road,
Greenwich, CT 06831.

Keep in touch and let us know how you and Payton are doing!

Fondly, Marcy Hanna

Serge didn't tell you...  I should have called and told you myself but I've
been so busy and this is why?

I'm a father....

Yes..Can you believe that?  My son (Payton L. Stepenovitch) was born May
12, 2000!  Did I tell you I got engaged to that girl I was dating in
Orlando?  Well we are separated now and she is back in Florida with my son!
I miss him so much but I go home every 2 weeks she wants to be close to her
family as well as mine.  I don't know if things will workout with her and I
but we have the most beautiful son in the world.  I'll send you some
pictures...what is your address?

Are you blown away?

Me too...

anyway give Marcy my best and I'll call you this weekend...

     Mr Step,

     James worked at Statoil and then at SETC for over a year.

     He never directly worked for me.  The impression I got was the was that
     he
     was organized and has a good understanding of energy transmission,
     losses,
     etc.  He helped the East goup with NEISO/NYISO for about a month and
     then
     was a day person and then 24 hour peron working for Missy Ellis trying
     to do
     real time business in the Midcon. (no comment by me on this SETC email)

     I do not think he ever has experienced real "trading" where he is
     actively
     buying and selling.  I am sure he could learn "trading" if put in the
     that
     environment.

     Marcy is doing great - buying lots of things for the house!

     How is your life outside of ENE?  Any new serious gf?

     My friend Rudy Stoett (Jim F knows him) is moving to Houston this
     weekend to
     work for Texaco.

     Let me know if you want to talk more about Mr Vasquez.

     Have a good weekend,

     Tim

Joe,

How are you?  I watched those prices swinging around last week in the east.
I wanted to get involved.

ENE is getting hammered today.  I guess investors do not know about you yet.

I talked to Pete Hanson the other day - he seems to be doing well and as
always speaks very highly of Sr.

Jim F is the man at broadband.

Hope you are enjoying the summer.

Tim

RE:		OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR ENRON KIDS' CENTER IS UNDERWAY!!!


OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR ENRON KIDS' CENTER IS UNDERWAY!!!

Want to be closer to your child during the workday?  Want to read to them at lunchtime or just give them a hug?  Then consider enrolling your child in the Enron Kids' Center.

Enron Kids' Center child care facility is currently under construction and will be located on Louisiana Street, across from our corporate headquarters in Houston. Enron is partnering with Knowledge Beginnings, one of the leaders in the child care industry, to provide high quality, conveniently located, customer service-oriented childcare for Enron employees in Houston. 


Anticipated opening date:	September 2001

Hours of operation:		The center will be open Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM - 6:30 PM. The center will be closed on all Enron holidays. In addition, special "parents' night out" care will be offered for occasions such as holiday shopping and night out at the movies for an additional fee.

Complete meal service:	Your child's breakfast, lunch and two snacks are included in tuition. Infants will need to bring their own food until they are ready for "table food".	

Eligibility:			Regular full-time or part-time Enron employees who are the parents or legal guardians of the child or children named on the application are eligible to enroll their children in the center.  Temporary employees, contract workers and non-custodial parents are not eligible to enroll their children in the child development center.

Contact Information:		Visit http://enronkids.enron.com to learn more about Enron Kids' Center or contact Knowledge
				Beginnings at 1-877-CHILDHOOD (between 8:00 am -5:00 p.m. PST).

Hey!  Thanks for showing up last night.  I am going to update the
divisions, rosters and schedules today.  Everything should be ready to go
this afternoon.  Just for back-up please email me your starting lineup for
week one.  Any problems getting into the system please feel free to call me
@ 713-207-1493.  Here are the pay-outs for the season:

     $10 per week for high scoring team for that week ( total pay-out for
year = $130 )

     $65 to high scoring team for season from your weekly starters ( total
pay-out for year = $65 )

     $35 to top scoring QB for the season, points only count for games
started
     $35 to top scoring RB for the season, points only count for games
started
     $35 to top scoring WR for the season, points only count for games
started
     $35 to top scoring PK for the season, points only count for games
started
     $35 to top scoring DF for the season, points only count for games
started (total pay-out for year = $175 )

     $25 to each of the 6 teams making play-offs ( total pay-out for year
= $150 )

     67% of remaining pot to 1st place
     33% of remaining pot to 2nd place

Here is the breakdown:

       $200 x 14 owners =  $2800
          less system fee =      $75
     less incentive pay =    $520
              remaining pot = $2205

     1st place winner @ 67% = $1477.35
     2nd place winner @ 33% = $727.65

Any questions drop me an email or call me.  Also your lineups are do before
kick-off of the first game of that week.  So more times than not your
line-ups are due Sunday before kickoff.  It is nice to have them in there
by Friday afternoon so that people can print out the lineups to take home
with them.  So when there is a Thursday night game your lineup for that
week including Sunday's games are due Thursday night before kick-off.
Thanks again for playing.  May the best owner win!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good luck.  Later Brian  Oh!  make sure that once I have updated everyone's
rosters that I gave you the right players.  Sometimes I will get mixed up
on the Smith's, Johnson's etc....

I would like to offer a different perspective on the attacks that occurred
last Tuesday. It's view of the forest that I don't think the press has not
gotten to in it's coverage so far.

The American reaction to this has been healthy and accurate. After reading
books on Normandy, Iwo Jima, I always wondered if the US still possessed a
fire in it's belly to stoke if someone should ever deliver a blow like
this. So far so good, but can it be sustained to go the distance? While the
media focuses on the personal tragedy and how to cope with what HAS happen,
maybe we should get in touch with our courage as well as our emotions to
deal with what MAY happen.

In my opinion is that the US has been provoked into a larger scheme.
Whoever did this not only expects the US to launch counter attacks, they
are betting on it. And they are betting that the US won't go it alone. They
are betting that  Western intervention in the Mid East will destabilize the
region, possibly the world, and that will ultimately bring the demise of
Israel. That is what these fanatics are ultimately after.

As you know, we've fought in the mid east before, but this time it will be
different in many ways. If the West opts for a militarily engagement (and I
would be shocked if they didn't) they will not have the coalition they did
for the Gulf War. Many of the Arab countries that were on board during
Desert Storm will not be able to internally support Western counter attacks
that will be frequent, massive and multinational.

Of course we should expect that these terrorist factions to volley their
own counter attacks back against the US. Retaliatory strikes from terrorist
may not be as spectacular as what happened last Tuesday, but they will be
just as ugly. They have many unspeakable options.

The terrorists that perpetrated the attacks on Tuesday, have calculated
that we, the American people, can not stomach a long, drawn out, ugly,
conflict. Sadam Hussein  made this assumption in the past and it was the
overwhelming support from  the American people that ultimately gave us the
strength to exact our mission and bring our troops home so soon (your truly
included).

But the Gulf War was neither long or drawn out. A campaign through the
mountains of Persia probably will be long, difficult and ugly. If you
recall this region was the labeled the Russian 'Vietnam'. I think the
perpetrators have already assumed that American, public support will
dissolve quickly for a conflict with TWO fronts. The main front in the
Southwest Asia AND A DOMESTIC front that will feature psychological and
physical violence that American has never had to deal with before. Really
think about that and ask yourself have they calculated correctly? I
personally think they have made a grave error. America may have a broken
nose, but it's arms, legs, and spirit stand ready and waiting.

I offer these opinions to get folks thinking and preparing for what might
happen next. And if it does, we have to examine our reaction and RESOLVE
now. The war that the President says that we are now in will surely last
longer than the hundred day Gulf War. I think it will probably take years
with uncomfortable lulls between attacks and skirmishes.

And a final point. I can definitely understand why Americans would want to
postpone regular activities out of respect for the Americans that lost
their lives. It's a natural, reactive response. What most people don't
understand however is that you do not let terrorist dictate what you do.
When that happens, you living your life by their rules. May I suggest a
proactive response. Return to normal life as closely as you can. That is
the best, immediate, defiant message we can send back to them. The first of
many...um...messages, we will be sending them.

Mike

Dear Joe:

	I have attached a proposed final order for your review.  Most of the
language contained within the order is "standard" language with regard to
the rights, powers and duties as well as the visitation schedule under the
Standard Possession Order.  I have also emphasized in bold lettering those
areas in which some discussion is needed to finalize the document.  I
understand that you will be meeting with Mr. Fullenweider this afternoon and
I hope you will have time to review this to discuss those issues with him.

	I have attached the order in both Word and WordPerfect format.  If
you use Word, some of the formatting on the document will be off because I
converted it from WordPerfect, however, the substance should be verbatim.
If you have any problems pulling this up let me know and I will get you a
copy by alternate means.  Thanks.

Good Afternoon Brian,

How have you been?  I'm doing great.  I never got a chance to thank you
and your co-worker for the coffee mug.  Also, I wanted to thank you
again for dinner that night.  I still can't believe they acted that way.
Anyway, I should get my promo to Mgr at the end of the year so we'll
need to stay in touch and I might be in Hot-Lanta soon as well.


Well I think you talked to my friend Keller today and he wanted me to
forward you his resume.  I hope you and set him up with something.
Gotta run have a good holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

-Joe Step Jr.

Any more news on next week? Are you still flying in at 10:00 pm. I want to let mom know a little in advance if you want to go to Vero.  I cannot believe Larry Dierker resigned, although he probably would have been fired anyway.  This Saturday is full of great games and of couse I have to work until 2:00, ridiculous.  Later

don't have plans for that Saturday.  I'll find out today if I can get him 
for the whole day (12:00 to 7:00) If things workout I would like to take 
him to Vero for the day.  So I was thinking you could go with me to pick 
him up and we could spend the day and night in Vero?  Let me know what you

Anyway,  how are things down there?  Last weekend I went to Austin for the
