Kay -- Just some housekeeping questions:

Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward?

Do you want more comments from Origination and Services now, or do you want 
us to wait until you turn the doc?  As I said yesterday, I am in the process 
of sorting out the "Costs" definition so that it works better with the other 
parts of the doc.  

MDEA is willing to extend the ILA two weeks if we want to.  Their next Board 
meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately 
need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that 
meeting.  We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until 
their Board votes on the full agreement.  The other option is to get done 
this week and have them call a special Board meeting.  They have done this in 
the past, but we have not asked them if it's logistically possible to do this 
by May 31.

Thanks -- David

Hi Wilson,

We discussed asking the counterparties for opinion letters.  Could you outline what you think we should ask for, or alternatively, just draft it?

Thanks,

Kay, see attached.  The monthly fee should be $13,003.  I took the $300k we 
have all been discussing and backed out the $12,500 they paid under the ILA 
terms.

More:

We need internal agreement on the cancellation fee schedule, to be included 
as an exhibit.

What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement?  Do we still want 
a master gas agreement for Clarksdale, also?  Do we want it now?

Thanks,

Subject: Open items for MDEA

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay -- Just some housekeeping questions:

Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward?

Do you want more comments from Origination and Services now, or do you want us to wait until you turn the doc?  As I said yesterday, I am in the process of sorting out the "Costs" definition so that it works better with the other parts of the doc.  

MDEA is willing to extend the ILA two weeks if we want to.  Their next Board meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that meeting.  We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until their Board votes on the full agreement.  The other option is to get done this week and have them call a special Board meeting.  They have done this in the past, but we have not asked them if it's logistically possible to do this by May 31.

Thanks -- David

Attached is a? copy of the proposal  with my revisions--my changes and 
deletions are shown in blue.? I had  indicated in our telephone conference 
that I was expecting you to make the  changes we discussed but that I was to 
furnish you language in a couple of  instances.? Instead I made changes in 
all instances that we  discussed.? In addition, Marvin and Bob Priest asked 
me to make three  changes--these include deleting the "breakup" fee of 
$50,000, deleting the 95%  guaranteed availability and adding "best efforts" 
obligation language, and  adding language acknowledging that the monthly 
guaranteed fee would satisfy  Enron's costs for software and hardware.? 
Please let me know if the changes  are satisfactory.
?
I apologize for the delay--but I had to get  my client's O.K. on these 
matters.
?
I also was talking to Wilson Montjoy on  another matter and told him I did 
not consider it a conflict for him to  represent Enron on this matter.? He is 
a good lawyer.

No. 1 -- (a)  We need to clarify what "arrange" means.  For example, who is 
responsible for paying for Point to Point service (which would probably be 
needed in order to import/export power from Entergy or when sourcing/selling 
to a non-designated resource.)  Also, there is a huge risk that PTP (or the 
ability to add a network resource) will not be available at the time when 
importing/exporting power is most economical.  EPMI can reserve/schedule on 
behalf of Clarksdale, but will Clarksdale be paying for the extra 
transmission service?  

 (b)  Entergy's policies allow for a day ahead designation of network 
resources, if transmission is available.  However, this designation is not as 
firm as the network service that  Clarksdale will be purchasing when 
requesting its original network.  It seems that we can state that we will not 
impact Clarksdale's original network resource designation; however, when 
using an alternate designation, there is the possibility that the 
transmission could be cut before the rest of firm.  We can agree to this, but 
lose flexibility.  I agree that we would then need the local quick start 
generation in order to meet this request (however, such plant may not be 
available either.)

No. 6  Both of the above tie into this one (as well as the "profit" 
calculation in No. 3) -- how is the "goal" of minimizing the resulting net 
power supply costs measured?  EPMI will probably not be totally successful in 
having a cost reduction 100% of the time, especially if we try to use 
non-firm transmission at times because generally that imported/exported power 
cost can be to their advantage.  Since the Cities will have final approval, 
they may want to take some risk and use non-firm: understanding that 
sometimes it won't work and the plant may have to run.  This wording also 
needs to be clarified as to "arrange" -- for example, "reserve transmission 
on behalf of Clarksdale"; "schedule transactions via etag on behalf of 
Clarksdale."

Costs (xi) Add "SPP or" Serc-imposed..
  I don't think there are SERC protocols or a SERC ISO
"Confidential Information" is in Section 23, not 25.  I was looking at this 
because both MDEA andEPMI stated in the FERC filing re: the Entergy/MDEA int. 
agree, that there was an Energy Management agreement between us.

Ex. 3   Make sure that there are "SPP Protocols" and that there is something 
called a "Scheduling Entity" (If so, then may want to add a definition of 
"SPP Protocols" in the definitions.)

Subject: RE: Control Area Certification

Regan attached below is the process that Clarksdale has to start to become a 
Control Area in case they don't have it.

We should be able to get our systems hooked up to them in 60 days once we 
have the green light from Ozzie to charge (approx $300K).

It will be tough to get their portion done in less than 4-6 months due to the 
dependency on others who tend to not cooperate.

One of the major items we need to help them with is completing their 
Interconnection agreement and get this process started and then some form of 
Services contract that can be used for the audit, I have a draft one that I 
will forward to you by end of the week.

Thanks.

I've recopied below Miss. Code Ann. Sec. 77-5-727. Subsection (u) appears to 
answer your question, at least as to purchases of electric power. I'm not 
aware of anything under the joint action agancy law that empowers the entity 
to buy gas on behalf of its members.

Section 77-5-729 provides authority for the member utility to contract with 
the joint agency to purchase power. It's recopied below as well.


o 77-5-725. Powers of joint agencies
Current through End of 2000 3rd Ex. Sess.
References     Annotations
Each joint agency shall have all of the rights and powers necessary or 
convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this 
article, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the 
rights and powers:
(a) To adopt bylaws for the regulation of the affairs and the conduct of its 
business, and to prescribe rules, regulations and policies in connection with 
the performance of its functions and duties;
(b) To adopt an official seal and alter the same at pleasure;

political subdivision, agencies or instrumentalities of any state, or with 
any one or more joint agencies created pursuant to this article, or any 
person, firm, association or corporation, public or private, engaged in the 
generation, transmission or distribution of electric power and energy within 
this state or any other state, and to pay all or any part of the costs 
thereof from the proceeds of bonds of the joint agency or from any other 
funds made available to the joint agency;

all such purposes;
(p) To negotiate and enter into contracts for the purchase, sale, exchange, 
interchange, wheeling, pooling, transmission or use of electric power and 
energy with any municipality in this state or any other state owning electric 
distribution facilities, or with any political subdivisions, agencies or

licenses, permits, certificates or approvals in the same manner as any other 
person or operating unit of any other person;  provided, however, nothing 
herein contained shall be construed to require the joint agency to obtain any 
permit, license, certificate or approval from the Public Service Commission 
of Mississippi;
(s) To employ engineers, architects, attorneys, real estate counselors, 
appraisers, financial advisors and such other consultants and employees as 
may be required in the judgment of the joint agency and to fix and pay their 
compensation from funds available to the joint agency therefor;
(t) To purchase all kinds of insurance including, but not limited to, 
insurance against business interruption, and/or risks of damage to property;
(u) To purchase power and energy and related services from any source on 
behalf of its members and other customers and to sell the same to its members

periods of time and under such terms and conditions as the board of 
commissioners shall determine;  and
(v) To do all acts and things necessary, convenient or desirable to carry out 
the purposes, and to exercise the powers granted to the joint agency herein.


o 77-5-729. Contracts by members to buy power from joint agencies
Current through End of 2000 3rd Ex. Sess.
References
Any municipality which is a member of the joint agency may contract to buy 
from the joint agency power and energy required for its present or future 
requirements, including the capacity and output of one or more specified 
projects.  As the creation of a joint agency is an alternative method whereby 
a municipality may obtain the benefits and assume the responsibilities of 
ownership in a project, any such contract may provide that the municipality 
so contracting shall be obligated to make the payments required by the 
contract whether or not a project is completed, operable, operating, retired 
or decommissioned and notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, 
interference, reduction, curtailment or termination of the output of a 
project or the power and energy contracted for, and that such payments under 
the contract shall not be subject to any reduction whether by offset or 
otherwise, and shall not be conditioned upon the performance or 
nonperformance of the joint agency or any other member of the joint agency 
under the contract or any other instrument.  Any contract with respect to the 
sale or purchase of capacity or output of a project entered into between a 
joint agency and its member municipalities may also provide that if one or 
more of such municipalities shall default in the payment of its or their 
obligations, with respect to the purchase of said capacity or output, then in 
that event the remaining member municipalities which are purchasing capacity 
and output under the contract shall be required to accept and pay for and 
shall be entitled proportionately to and may use or otherwise dispose of the 
capacity or output which was to be purchased by the defaulting municipality.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, any such 
contracts with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity, output, power or 
energy from a project may extend for a period not exceeding fifty (50) years 
from the date a project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous 
operation;  and the execution and effectiveness thereof shall not be subject 
to any authorizations or approvals by the state or any agency, commission or 
instrumentality or political subdivision thereof except as in this article 
specifically required and provided.
Payments by a municipality under any contract for the purchase of capacity 
and output from a joint agency shall be made solely from the revenues derived 
from the ownership and operation of the electric system of said municipality 
and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or 
equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any property of the 
municipality or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues, except the 
revenues of its electric system, and neither the faith and credit nor the 
taxing power of the municipality are, or may be, pledged for the payment of 
any obligation under any such contract.  A municipality shall be obligated to 
fix, charge and collect rents, rates, fees and charges for electric power and 
energy and other services, facilities and commodities, sold, furnished or 
supplied through its electric system sufficient to provide revenues adequate 
to meet its obligations under any such contract and to pay any and all other 
amounts payable from or constituting a charge and lien upon such revenues, 
including amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on bonds 
heretofore or hereafter issued by the municipality for purposes related to 
its electric system.
Any municipality which is a member of a joint agency may furnish the joint 
agency with money derived solely from the ownership and operation of its 
electric system or facilities and may make available for the use of the joint 
agency any personnel, equipment and property, both real and personal, which 
is a part of its electric system or facilities.
Any member of a joint agency may contract for, advance or contribute funds 
derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or 
facilities to a joint agency as may be agreed upon by the joint agency and 
the member, and the joint agency shall repay such advances or contributions 
from proceeds of bonds, from operating revenues or from any other funds of 
the joint agency, together with interest thereon as may be agreed upon by the 
member and the joint agency.

That means it is recognized, not  "contemplated to be recognized", then?  Is there such a thing as a recognized scheduling entity, or do you just schedule on their behalf? [Rorschach, Reagan]  SPP does not have such an entity at this point.  However, everyone expects this to happen sometime soon.  If this is causing probelms or commitments on our part because this is not even in existance, we should think about deleting reference to SPP rules and regs.  Once the scope of an SPP defined scheduling entity is proferred, we can discuss any additional efforts required on our part to meet and be in compliance with that scope.

What about this?  Is this the QSE defn? [Rorschach, Reagan]  No, that would be Qualified Scheduling Entity that has a very lengthly ERCOT definition.  This was greatly simplified to eliminate any confusion.  I think it is OK as is. 

"Scheduling Entity" means an entity contemplated to be recognized by SPP, and fully qualified under SPP rules and regulations, to schedule the transmission of Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services from the Facilities.

Hi Wilson,

I haven't forgotten you, I just got tied up.  

This is a very preliminary draft, but thought you should take a look at it.  
I don't need a detailed analysis, I just want you to have it so that we can 
discuss the impact of Mississippi law.

I am specifically interested in discussing the following:

waivers of consequential damages, limitations of liability

legal status of MDEA (I'll send you the info of what I have)

dispute resolution and jurisdiction

restrictions on confidentiality restrictions

any other aspects of the agreement impacted by Mississippi law

I don't need any memos, just a discussion.

Thanks,

Kay

From:  Cross, Edith  
Sent: Thursday, April 12, 2001 4:53 PM

Subject: MDEA Comments

Here are my comments on the MDEA draft:

1)  It is my understanding that the TECO-Frontera contract was used as a 
template for MDEA.  I would like to clarify the differences between the TECO 
deal and the MDEA deal.  The TECO-Frontera deal consists of EPMI marketing 
the excess capacity off the Frontera plant.  TECO has some existing sales off 
that plant which are not incorporated in our profit sharing arrangement 
("Existing Transactions").  Also, we agreed to work with them to sell 
"Structured Transactions" off the plant.  The "Back-to-Back Transactions" 
refer to the daily sale of MW off the plant, that EPMI is sleeving for TECO.  
I understand that we may have opportunities to sell excess generation off 
MDEA's generation assets, however, I don't think the bulk of the contract 
should focus on this.  There is little mention of the obligation to serve the 
Native Load through 3rd party transactions, which as I understand it, is the 
intent of the MDEA deal.  

2)  Definitions section:

 Existing Transactions - defined as MDEA having prior obligations to sell 
energy etc.  - I don't think MDEA has any of these outside of their Native 
Load.

 Marketing Strategy - This mentions a Trading and Risk policy.  The policy 
used for TECO  mentions that EPMI will provide VAR reports.  This will not be 
done for    Clarksdale/Yazoo.

3)  Section 4 - Availability of Products; Metering

 Risk of loss and all price, credit, and unit contingency....      I thought 
we were bearing credit risk with 3rd parties.

 Further down in the paragraph in parens... (and execute a Confirmation 
evidencing such obligation)...   We need to check with the Deal Clearing 
group what they will be   confirming.  Normally, hourly trades do not get 
confirmed.  I have not yet informed anyone in confirms about this deal 
because I was assuming we would not have to provide   confirms to MDEA.  
Please let me know if this is not the case.

4)  Section 8 - Performance Standards

 (b) (1) Availability calculation is using 480 MW, this is the Frontera plant 
capacity.

5)  Section 9 - Delivery Point and Title

 What about sales to MDEA from EPMI (this goes back to my statement in #1 
that this contract focuses more on the buy side instead of the sale). 


6)  Section 11 - Fuel management services

 I thought we were sleeving the gas, therefore, EPMI will be a party to the 
Fuel Related Transactions.

6)  Section 16 - Payment and Fees

 Existing Transaction Costs are mentioned - These may be irrelevant to this 
section

 "Market Proceeds"  - I think this should more specifically state that this 
is only in relation to the Mwhrs sold off their facilities to a 3rd party.

 MOST IMPORTANTLY - There is no mention of how EPMI will be reimbursed for 
the power that we purchase on MDEA's behalf.  I expect that this will be most 
of the    settlement activity related to this deal.    

7)  Exhibit [] REPORTS
 
 1) Profit & Loss, Risk Statement - This says that we will track the change 
in value of the power output.  We are not going to monitor the forward value 
of their positions.

 2)  Position Statement - This will not be done at all.  To truly give an 
accurate position statement, we would need to forecast their load for the 
next two years, and then   economically dispatch the plants to see what their 
net short position is.  I don't think this is relevant, and per my previous 
conversations with Reagan, we are not doing this.

 In the TECO agreement, we are giving a forward view of the value of the 
plant.  This cannot be done for MDEA because we cannot determine when we are 
dispatching to   serve their load or to sell to a 3rd party.  

This is all for now....

6.  Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies?

7. Bogey calc only addresses gas.  What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil?  
Does the fuel cost and heat rate change?

Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it

Subject: Open items for MDEA

[Fairley, David]  


Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


1. How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the 
appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities 
must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel 
usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a 
quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used 
are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a 
band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as 
often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient 
temps..

2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, 
and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to 
us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are 
limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.


3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we 
may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product 
transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible 
for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

4. We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is 
basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way 
we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product 
trade, and those procedures apply.

5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in 
to the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of 
Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been 
modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been 
discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their 
comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the 
parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and 
Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract 
language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of 
power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, 
(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for 
imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their 
Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource 
items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  
Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances 
(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly 
desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions 
and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states 
that MDEA wears the exposure.

 How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is 
set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties 
participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and 
planning the day's activities.  
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved

Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing 
something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have 
less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them 
to participate and buy in every day.  

Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
[Fairley, David]  
One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  
[Fairley, David]  
This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?

What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost 
definition being provided separately.
 



Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. 
[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. 

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. 
[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what 
was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that 
is a problem. 

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily 
and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing 
responsibilities to those reports.

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

What about this?  Is this the QSE defn? [Rorschach, Reagan]  No, that would be Qualified Scheduling Entity that has a very lengthly ERCOT definition.  This was greatly simplified to eliminate any confusion.  I think it is OK as is. 

"Scheduling Entity" means an entity contemplated to be recognized by SPP, and fully qualified under SPP rules and regulations, to schedule the transmission of Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services from the Facilities.

Kay-

Off-peak includes all weekends and NERC defined holidays.  For example, 
Friday at hour ending 2300 until hour ending 0600 Monday, you are off-peak.  
Let me know if you need those holidays, the control room guys can dig them 
up.

According to the control room guys, "off peak" is defined as hour ending 2300 
to hour ending 0600.  They indicate that this is a NERC standard.

Kay,

Here is the Cover Sheet and Attachments for the above C/P.  I wasn't sure 
about the due diligence on the "agency relationship" so was unsure as to 
whether to put those riders in.  I have attached those riders so you can 
advise me.  The Agreement is housed in your directory minus the General Terms 
and Conditions.  When you are ready to send the Agreement then I can attach 
the GTC.

Thanks,

I think that this will continue to be a very sticky issue for us on all 
services deals and I think the following is the way to handle it.

We build into all of these contracts that the counterparty may at any time, 
chose to transact directly with a third counterparty.  We would still 
administer the contracts and perform the scheduling etc. for them if they 
chose to do this.  In this way, the customer may always chose to deal 
directly if they chose and we would be doing the scheduling.  I believe that 
this will serve to counteract concerns that we will not provide them fair 
market prices since they could always chose to deal directly.  We are 
confident that our prices are will be competitive and that the counterparty 
will chose to transact through us.  We would of course need to protect our 
share of the benefit in the case they transact with someone else.

Subject: MDEA Commercial Issues

In an effort to get the commercial terms of the contract organized and 
papered, we discussed the following issues during yesterday's meeting:

? What will be the contracted process for setting the Bogey?
? What heat rates or heat rate ranges will go in the contract?
? Can we create a schedule to collar the Bogey given a certain gas price?
? Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager? (this is a 
retrade)
? How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary 
services get accounted for in the "cost" calculation?
? How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit 
or a cost?

Regarding calculation of the Bogey, we have several issues.  First, what is 
the methodology?  Rick is very close to having a stack model that 
incorporates the business rules including minimum run times, startup costs, 
VOM, etc.  Second, what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for 
running the model?  This process will need to be documented every time the 
calc is performed.  Third, what is the timing of the calc?  We discussed 
getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a "day ahead" basis.  
Only on a select basis would the calc be re-done mid-day.

We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on 
these issues.  This should result in a set of business rules that can be put 
into the contract.

Please comment/correct/add/subtract to any or all of the above.  David 
Fairley and I will be sending out the Marketing Strategy and Trading and Risk 
Policy later this morning.

Thanks,

Reagan

Kay,

Regarding calculation of the profit, can we add the caviot that "a more 
comprehensive calcuation of the profit would be agreed to by the parties in 
the definitive agreement."??

I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the ILA until June 15.  

I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I thought I would give you a heads up.

David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.  If you have your preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay -- The comments in the attached doc relate primarily to accrual vs. MTM 
accounting.  They seem to be recommending repeatedly that our language covers 
an accrual accounting deal, and does not work for MTM accounting.  Is this 
assumption correct, or am I missing the point?  Please let me know what you 
think.  Thanks -- David

Ruthie is getting big too!  I guess she must have been underweight when we 
got her, and then she's also a big pig.  Rex (our new dog) is smaller, about 
30 pounds.  You should see Ruthie bossing him around.  He's easy going 
though.  

Rosco is going to be a big boy!

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi David,

I've made the changes to the cover sheet regarding the Master Power agreement.  Here's the redline.

 

It seems to me that we are missing an October payment date on Exhibit 5 of the EMSA, so I'll add one.  Also, Marvin found a typo on page 11 (sub h) regarding the SEPA MWHrs - should be 16,500.  I'll change this.  Any other changes?

Thanks,

Kay

I think that this will continue to be a very sticky issue for us on all services deals and I think the following is the way to handle it.

We build into all of these contracts that the counterparty may at any time, chose to transact directly with a third counterparty.  We would still administer the contracts and perform the scheduling etc. for them if they chose to do this.  In this way, the customer may always chose to deal directly if they chose and we would be doing the scheduling.  I believe that this will serve to counteract concerns that we will not provide them fair market prices since they could always chose to deal directly.  We are confident that our prices are will be competitive and that the counterparty will chose to transact through us.  We would of course need to protect our share of the benefit in the case they transact with someone else.

Kay -- The fuel activity is so limited in scope that a separate Exhibit is 
questionable.  If you don't want fuel in the contract body, then why not make 
it a subset of the marketing plan.  Fuel activity is directly linked to power 
marketing when running their units. Thanks -- david

Hi David,

Reagan struck all the references to the Fuel Plan.  

I think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits, but 
we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if that's better for you.  
It just seemed that it would easier to work  with in the exhibits.

Kay -- Do you want detail about our specific power and gas activity 
obligations in the body of the contract, or in the Marketing Plan?  Is the 
fuel plan included in the Marketing Plan?

Marvin, 

The exhibit on the Incentive Fee Calculation I just received is essentially 
the same as we have seen before, and I still have the same overall comment.? 
Unless I have some misunderstanding, it seems to me that in a Back-to-Back 
Transaction you could easily have a situation in which EPMI is making a 
profit from a transaction on which the Cities are losing money.? The "Savings 
per hour" on which EPMI's profit sharing is based is only the difference 
between the Market Price (what the purchaser agreed to pay) and the Cities' 
Target Production Cost (incremental fuel cost and variable O&M).? The 
"Savings per hour" ignores all of the other costs that the Cities may be 
obligated to pay under a Back-to-Back Transaction such as transmission, 
ancillary service, imbalance, congestion, etc. (see the definition of Costs 
below).? For example, if the Target Production cost is $40/MWh, the Market 
Price $43/MWh, and transmission is $4/MWh, the Cities would be paying EPMI a 
profit sharing incentive fee of $1.20/MWh, while losing $2.20/MWh on the sale 
transaction.? As I have noted before, the "Savings" on a transaction should 
be as follows:

Savings = Revenues from the Transaction - Production Cost (base on the Target 
Production Cost and MWhs) - Costs associated with the Transaction incurred by 
EPMI or the Cities (where Costs include the items defined in Article 1 of the 
EMSA)

We will get back to you later with comments on the other documents. - - Al 


Definition of Costs in the ESMA: 

"Costs" means, when applicable to any Transaction, all costs, liabilities, 
fees and expenses? incurred by EPMI (excluding EPMI's internal costs and 
allocated overhead) in connection with the purchase, sale, replacement, 
scheduling, transmission and delivery of Products and balancing services, 
entered into between MDEA, EPMI, and third parties. Costs shall include but 
shall not be limited to: (i) energy and fuel costs, (ii) transmission costs 
and losses, (iii) congestion costs, (iv) scheduling fees, (v) penalties, 
inadvertent energy flow charges, or imbalance charges that are exclusive of 
MDEA's Ancillary Service charges (vi) taxes (other than income taxes); (vii) 
fees, penalties, or charges imposed by the SPP, SERC, ISO or RTO, Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), or other similar authorities; (viii) 
broker fees; (ix) communication costs (x) other associated costs incurred by 
EPMI.?

It is o.k. to schedule for someone day-ahead, however when you break it down 
to real time there are too many timing issues to do someone else's 
scheduling.  You are at their mercy of when they do the deal and it may not 
leave adequate time to execute.

Thanks

Reagan,

I've requested the issuance of a draft master (gas) for Clarksdale.  Yazoo has theirs in hand, but I haven't heard any of any comments.

The power side is a bit more complicated.  Yazoo City and Clarksdale have not cut a deal between them to determine how to buy power - whether it should be bought  by MDEA (easier in some accounting respects, but credit is more of an issue) or by the individual Cities.  

Maybe this should be on the list for our 300 meeting.

Kay

1.  Need details re item 1  below.  Please suggest language (band of 
acceptability, etc) which I will massage and incorporate.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Heat rates for given output from each machine are 
incorporated in the bogey model.  We will establish these for contract 
purposes in the exhibit that specs out all owned assets.  Those are the rates 
that we will discuss/modify each quarter.
[Fairley, David]  Even though tweaking heat rates in the stack model 
periodically (at least to be discussed quarterly) is subjective, MDEA would 
always want to be as accurate as possible because the the inaccuracy causes 
the incorrect quantity of gas to be nominated, so they underburn or overburn 
for the day, which would get expensive if the extent of the inaccuracy were 
very much.  They wear the risk on this.  Being short or long delivered gas 
presents a variety of ways in which MDEA has to pay for costs to get in 
balance.  Therefore, any desire that they might have to improperly shift the 
"bogey" to pay us $2 - 4 less per MWh, costs them more in gas imbalance costs.

6.  Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies? [Rorschach, 
Reagan]   Yes 
[Fairley, David]  Sent via e-mail 5-21, but will re-send that e-mail for 
convenience.

7. Bogey calc only addresses gas.  What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil?  
Does the fuel cost and heat rate change?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  heat rates change when switching to fuel oil.  That info 
is not available from MDEA.  If the opportunity presents itself, we will 
evaluate on a event specific basis and agree to the actual cost of 
production. [Fairley, David]    The rule of thumb  that we will use to look 
at the Stack Model when burning oil vs. gas is about a 5% improvement  in 
heat rate with oil.  Cost per MMBtu is whatever we plug into the model, 
whether gas or oil, and prices change daily and intraday anyway, so price 
changes don't bother us.  Since the oil is coming out of their tank, there is 
no concern about gas imbalance cost, therefore agonizing very much about heat 
rate modifications when using oil vs. gas is not really very practical.

Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it 
is.  I did  a quick search and couldn't find it, but I didn't do a page turn 
to locate it. 
[Fairley, David]  It is in the last exhibit, MDEA EPMI Incentive Fee 
Calculation, Exhibit XX, attached.  I'm not sure that Section 13 and Exhibit 
XX work well together.  They were drafted at different times.  I will send 
any comments on this in the morning.  (The only thing that we have changed in 
this group of exhibits attached is the revised asset management services 
description that was e-mailed with the Marketing Strat. and the Trad & Risk 
Policy).

   

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Open items for MDEA

[Fairley, David]  


Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


1. How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the 
appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities 
must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel 
usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a 
quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used 
are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a 
band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as 
often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient 
temps..

2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, 
and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to 
us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are 
limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.


3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we 
may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product 
transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible 
for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

4. We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is 
basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way 
we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product 
trade, and those procedures apply.

5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in 
to the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of 
Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been 
modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been 
discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their 
comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the 
parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and 
Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract 
language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of 
power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, 
(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for 
imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their 
Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource 
items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  
Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances 
(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly 
desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions 
and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states 
that MDEA wears the exposure.

 How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is 
set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties 
participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and 
planning the day's activities.  
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved

Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing 
something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have 
less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them 
to participate and buy in every day.  

Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
[Fairley, David]  
One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  
[Fairley, David]  
This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?

What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost 
definition being provided separately.
 



Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. 
[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. 

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. 
[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what 
was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that 
is a problem. 

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily 
and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing 
responsibilities to those reports.

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

1.  Need details re item 1  below.  Please suggest language (band of acceptability, etc) which I will massage and incorporate.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Heat rates for given output from each machine are incorporated in the bogey model.  We will establish these for contract purposes in the exhibit that specs out all owned assets.  Those are the rates that we will discuss/modify each quarter.
[Fairley, David]  Even though tweaking heat rates in the stack model periodically (at least to be discussed quarterly) is subjective, MDEA would always want to be as accurate as possible because the the inaccuracy causes the incorrect quantity of gas to be nominated, so they underburn or overburn for the day, which would get expensive if the extent of the inaccuracy were very much.  They wear the risk on this.  Being short or long delivered gas presents a variety of ways in which MDEA has to pay for costs to get in balance.  Therefore, any desire that they might have to improperly shift the "bogey" to pay us $2 - 4 less per MWh, costs them more in gas imbalance costs.

6.  Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies? [Rorschach, Reagan]   Yes 
[Fairley, David]  Sent via e-mail 5-21, but will re-send that e-mail for convenience.

7. Bogey calc only addresses gas.  What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil?  Does the fuel cost and heat rate change?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  heat rates change when switching to fuel oil.  That info is not available from MDEA.  If the opportunity presents itself, we will evaluate on a event specific basis and agree to the actual cost of production. [Fairley, David]    The rule of thumb  that we will use to look at the Stack Model when burning oil vs. gas is about a 5% improvement  in heat rate with oil.  Cost per MMBtu is whatever we plug into the model, whether gas or oil, and prices change daily and intraday anyway, so price changes don't bother us.  Since the oil is coming out of their tank, there is no concern about gas imbalance cost, therefore agonizing very much about heat rate modifications when using oil vs. gas is not really very practical.

Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it is.  I did  a quick search and couldn't find it, but I didn't do a page turn to locate it. 
[Fairley, David]  It is in the last exhibit, MDEA EPMI Incentive Fee Calculation, Exhibit XX, attached.  I'm not sure that Section 13 and Exhibit XX work well together.  They were drafted at different times.  I will send any comments on this in the morning.  (The only thing that we have changed in this group of exhibits attached is the revised asset management services description that was e-mailed with the Marketing Strat. and the Trad & Risk Policy).

    

Thanks,

Kay

[Fairley, David]  


Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement:


1. How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps..

2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.


3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

4. We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade, and those procedures apply.

5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties.

Good afternoon,

I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review. There are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal. 

Please note that  we are anticipating a Monday meeting.  Therefore, we have sent this out without the usual internal review.

We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly.

Talk to you soon,

Kay

Another research report. Miss. Code Ann Sec 21-27-59 provides that nothing in 
the law pursuant to which CPU was created shall be construed to prohibit the 
municipality from using general revenues to pay the "immediate expenses of 
operation and/or maintence" of the system. However, the statute provides that 
nothing requires the municipality to do so either.

We've found no case law expanding on this statute. Thus, there is no clear 
answer whether obligations of CPU to Enron would be considered the kinds of 
expenses which may be paid. If a guarantee by CPU of the obligations of MDEA 
is insufficient,  then it may be worth raising this issue with David Hunt.

As I mentioned in my voicemail last week, I do have some comments on the 
proposed agreement. Please let me know if you wish to discuss.

Kay - 

I just spoke with Marvin, he seems pretty happy--just a few comments so far:

? the arbitration/dispute resolution clause needs to reflect what is in the 
LOI
? weekends are not included in the definition of off-peak hours

I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really 
help move the document along.  I'll ask again if i can get it from him. There 
are still internal questions in it, which I have annotated. I'm happy for you 
to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive 
commercial direction.

Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I 
haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.  I know the 
bogey calc doc is a bit rough. [Rorschach, Reagan]  Exhibits are rough.  I 
need to make a list of Exhibits called out in the current doc version, pull 
them all together, and clean them up. 

Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff? [Rorschach, Reagan] 
  Yes.  I am not exactly sure of the context....but try this on for size:  
Clarksdale is subject to an Entergy transmission constraint that from time to 
time results in a transmission cut and mandates Clarksdale dispatching their 
generation assets to serve Clarksdale Native Load.  Dispatching Clarksdale 
assets under these circumstances is known as the first contingency must run 
condition.  During first contingency must run conditions, EPMI will document 
the production costs, megawatts generated, duration of the event, and lost 
opportunity cost of buying from the market.  Clarksdale is due reimbursement 
from Entergy for extra costs incurred during such events. 

Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge 
problem days for me.  When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?  Anyway to 
combine the two at once, given the short timeframe? [Rorschach, Reagan]  I 
think we could get everyone together at the same time as soon as Monday.  I 
want them to have the time to study the document so we can get it all done at 
once.  

Has Dave signed the extension, by the way? [Rorschach, Reagan]   done, 
fedex'ing to MDEA.  Will have faxed copy today.

Subject: MDEA Agreement Scheduling

Kay,

We are starting to run into some scheduling constraints for next week, at 
least with Bob Priest.  I'd like to get together with Bob and Marvin early 
next week to discuss the agreement--moving toward finalizing before June 12.  
Bob is only available Monday.  Bob and Marvin think it is a good ideal to 
then meet with RW Beck.

I'd like to email Marvin and Bob the next version sometime today?

More:

We need internal agreement on the cancellation fee schedule, to be included as an exhibit.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will create today and email to you.

What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement? [Rorschach, Reagan]   I will check.   Do we still want a master gas agreement for Clarksdale, also?   [Rorschach, Reagan]  yes Do we want it now? [Rorschach, Reagan]  yes, so long as it does not bog you down

Subject:	Open items for MDEA

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

See assignments and comments in red.  Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff responses due to Kay by noon today.


1)	General comments - 
a)	We have not seen a draft of the MPPSA or the MGPSA for review and comment. Kay
b)	All section references in the draft should be reviewed and checked.  The majority of the references checked were incorrect. Kay
c)	Since financial security is still an outstanding issue, all comments regarding the provisions in the draft pertaining to that subject have been excluded.  Kay
d)	The draft contains references throughout to exhibits that will be attached to the agreement that were not included in the draft.  See bleow.  

2)	Article 1, pages 6 and 7 - Profit and Savings: These definitions reference exhibits that were not included in the draft.   One of the most significant issues we had with the prior drafts were with the definition for "savings" so it is important to review a draft of these exhibits as soon as possible.   Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff to chech with Marvin.  He should have forwarded exhibits with everything else.  time is running out on them to do anything here.  Will report more on this issue.
   
3)	Section 3.1(b): This section obligates EPMI to "Propose" a load projection and stack model.  Should this say "Prepare" as opposed to "Propose".  "Prepare" is fine.

4)	Section 3.1(c): First line refers to a "request by Customer".  Customer is not defined, is this intended to refer to MDEA?  If not, include a definition of Customer.  "...upon request by Customer" is not necessary.  This has already been done.

5)	Section 3.2(a): Provides that EPMI will use "commercially reasonable efforts".  The draft does not include a definition for this term.  Suggest including a definition since this standard is used throughout the draft.  Kay

6)	Section 3.2(a): Suggest adding the following phrase in the second line after "schedule Products", "in a manner intended to minimize the cost of serving MDEA's native load".  Adding this seems fine; however, are there any legal implications, Kay?  If not, add it in.
 
7)	Section 3.2(c): Line 3 refers to Cajun and EPI, which are not defined in the draft.  Suggest including definitions or inserting the phrase "Existing Contract Resources" in place of "SEPA, Cajun, EPI".  The substitution is fine.

8)	Section 3.2(h): Line 1 provides "EPMI will optimize scheduling and usage or resale (when appropriate)".  Would suggest deleting "when appropriate" and inserting "(in accordance with the terms and conditions of each Existing Contracted Resources contract)".  The suggested change is OK.

9)	Section 4.1(a): Line 1 requires MDEA to operate and maintain its native load distribution system in accordance with Prudent Operating practices?.".  Would suggest deleting the phrase "and the Native Load distribution system".  This agreement does not bear on how the cities would operate and maintain their distribution systems.  Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff

10)	Section 6.4: The fourth sentence states " due to the use of imprecise data such as weather reports, heat rate estimates and the like, it is understood between the Parties that the resulting projections, recommendations and daily plan are consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices".   According to this provision, the parties agree in advance that the resulting projections, recommendations and daily plans are consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices.  We believe that the "use of that type of data" is consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices, but do not believe that that this automatically translates into the projections themselves being consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices.  Text should be changed as appropriate to reflect this change.  Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff


11)	Section 7.1: Second sentence provides "Risk of loss and all price and unit contingency and transmission risk shall be borne by Customer".  Suggest adding the phrase " For Back to Back Transactions" at the beginning of this sentence.  MDEA should not be responsible for unit contingency, transmission risk etc. for an EPMI Transaction.    Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff

12)	Section 10.2(a): Line 3, change " MDA" to "MDEA".  Kay

13)	Section 14.6: Line 3, change "and the MPPSA" to "the MPPSA and the MGPSA".  Kay

14)	Section 15.1(d): provides three business days written notice to the defaulting party to cure a Financial Event of Default, otherwise the agreement can be terminated.  Three days is too short of a time period for MDEA.  Kay/David Hunt/Jeff

15)	Section 17.1: Second sentence, provides that an independent auditor reasonably acceptable to EPMI is entitled to audit all books and records of EPMI.  However this provision goes on to state that EPMI shall be entitled to audit MDEA's books, not an independent auditor subject to MDEA's approval. Suggest deleting "EPMI shall be entitled to audit" and adding "An independent auditor reasonably acceptable to MDEA".  Kay

16)	Article 28: As we have previously noted, this section contains language related to conflict of interest issues and the lack of notification related to conflicts of interest that should be read carefully reviewed by MDEA and the Cities.  Kay/David Hunt/Jeff

Another research report. Miss. Code Ann Sec 21-27-59 provides that nothing in the law pursuant to which CPU was created shall be construed to prohibit the municipality from using general revenues to pay the "immediate expenses of operation and/or maintence" of the system. However, the statute provides that nothing requires the municipality to do so either.

We've found no case law expanding on this statute. Thus, there is no clear answer whether obligations of CPU to Enron would be considered the kinds of expenses which may be paid. If a guarantee by CPU of the obligations of MDEA is insufficient,  then it may be worth raising this issue with David Hunt.

As I mentioned in my voicemail last week, I do have some comments on the proposed agreement. Please let me know if you wish to discuss.

Definition of Event of Default - References Section 17.  I believe this 
should be Section 14.  This same reference to 17 is also made in other areas 
of the contract, such as in Section 15 "Termination".  Also, please note that 
under Section 15, some of the Event of Default Sections numbers do not exist 
(ie. 11 and 12).  Please look into these sections in their entirety.  With 
respect to this section, I would like to change the cure period from 30 days 
to 3 days and of course in instances of bankruptcy, misrepresenation in the 
Reps & Warr, etc., there should not a cure period.  

With respect to credit.  In reading the contract it seems that the 
counterparty is going to be a consortium of entities (MDEA, Yazoo & 
Clarksdale).  Are each of the counterparties jointly and severally liable?  
Answers to the this relationship structure will be necessary prior to 
proposing credit terms for both the Master Gas and Master Power agmts.  If 
this is the structure, we should probably look into getting legal opinions 
regarding the cities' authority to enter into such obligations.  In addition, 
do the city's have authority to enter into agreements for greater than 1 yr.  
In my experience with other munis, they generally are, but only at the 
Enterprise Fund level (Public Utility).  Perhaps we should confirm this.  To 
the extent that MDEA (stand alone) is not 100% supported by the cities, we 
will need financial statements on MDEA.

Reagan - Please forward projected load schedule when completed.

Jeff,

Looks like we  may actually close this week.  We need the two gas agreements to get it all nailed down. Can you give me some guidance on how to get this wrapped up on the gas side?

I finally got comments back from the customer on the asset management, gas and power contracts.  I'm writing to pass along the comments which pertain to all three contracts:

Governing law must be Mississippi.

Confidentiality is limited under Mississippi law since these are governmental entities.  We are addressing it in the Energy Management Services Agreement, so it could be deleted from the Masters, or I can supercede what's in the Masters in the EMSA, or we can use the language from the EMSA in the Masters.  

Limits of liability/waivers of consequentials/waivers of implied warranties.  None of this is permitted under Mississippi law, in some cases because it is never permitted, in some cases because these are governmental entities.  I want it in the EMSA anyway, just in case the law gets better.  I'll have language for this shortly.  Basically, it is "if and to the extent [Party B] is permitted to do so under applicable law...

Arbitration.  Arbitration must be pursuant to Section 11-15-1 et seq of the Mississippi Code Annotated (1972).  In case this doesn't work they have agreed to venue in the Federal District Court in Jackson Mississippi.

Business Day should exclude State holidays in Mississippi.

Performance Assurance  needs to have "as may be permissible under applicable law", as Mississippi law restricts what they can give.

Payment: governmental entities can't be charged interest until 45 days after they receive the invoice. Also, invoices have to go on a claims docket, so the earliest they can pay is within 5 days after the first meeting of the governing board after receipt of the invoice.

Security interest.  They can't grant a security interest.


They've called a special session of the governing board to approve the documents tomorrow afternoon, so I would appreciate your input on how to handle the integration of these issues into the masters.

I expect to have the risk memo tomorrow morning.

Kay

Attached is a memo discussing the law applicable to the Power Marketing Agreement.  

After discussing the matter with some attorneys around the office, the unanimous response is that North MS/Delta/Coahoma County is not going to be a favorable venue for any litigation involving Enron.  Juries all over Mississippi have recently become enamored with redistribution of wealth.  The demographics and socio-economic characteristics of the Clarksdale area suggest that a jury trial would not be a good experience for Enron.  

If you have any questions about the memo or other topics, please contact me.  Have a good 4th of July.

Thanks, 
John Brunini

Attached is the latest revision, incorporating comments from the Enron team.  
There were some comments which were either discussion points or not readily 
decipherable, so those will need to be addressed in the next version.  
There's still some harmonization/nit stuff which we will pick up then also.  
Hopefully, David Hunt (MDEA's lawyer) and I will hammer out the more 
legalistic (yet important) stuff while he is in our office tomorrow.

Ed, maybe we can schedule a call with our local counsel to get some  more 
comfort on the authority issue.   In addition, we can ask for an 
authority/enforceability opinion from MDEA's counsel.  We'll beef up the reps 
as well.

Reagan/David, Ed's availability is best first thing tomorrow (Thurs) morning. 

See you soon,

Kay

Gentlemen,

Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week?  I would
appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues.  I
have the lofty goal of not working Memorial Day weekend this year, so I'm
trying to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  I'm open Tues am and most of Wednesday.  I can probably work my
schedule so that I'm available quite a bit of next week.

I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the
ILA until June 15.

I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I
thought I would give you a heads up.

David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.  If you have your
preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Open items for MDEA

[Fairley, David]  


Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the 
appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities 
must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel 
usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a 
quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used 
are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a 
band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as 
often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient 
temps..

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, 
and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to 
us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are 
limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.


We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we 
may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product 
transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible 
for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is 
basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way 
we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product 
trade, and those procedures apply.

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of 
Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been 
modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been 
discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their 
comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the 
parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and 
Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract 
language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of 
power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, 
(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for 
imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their 
Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource 
items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  
Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances 
(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly 
desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions 
and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states 
that MDEA wears the exposure.

 How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is 
set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties 
participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and 
planning the day's activities.  
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved

Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing 
something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have 
less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them 
to participate and buy in every day.  

Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
[Fairley, David]  
One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  
[Fairley, David]  
This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?

What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost 
definition being provided separately.
 



Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. 
[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. 

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. 
[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what 
was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that 
is a problem. 

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily 
and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing 
responsibilities to those reports.

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Tom -- Good point.  I am glad that you came to this conclusion.  The way the 
contract is written now provides that MDEA can do term deals on their own 
with third parties.  Our profit calcs are covered.  On the other hand, MDEA 
does not have the ability to do hourly and daily type deals with third 
parties.  We can talk about this aspect and I can give you the reasons for 
doing it this way.  In referring to the way the contract is written, take 
that comment with a grain of salt since we have not finished the contract, 
and a lot of areas like this may need work by our side (commercial) so that 
Kay can finish the doc.  Thanks -- David

I think that this will continue to be a very sticky issue for us on all 
services deals and I think the following is the way to handle it.

We build into all of these contracts that the counterparty may at any time, 
chose to transact directly with a third counterparty.  We would still 
administer the contracts and perform the scheduling etc. for them if they 
chose to do this.  In this way, the customer may always chose to deal 
directly if they chose and we would be doing the scheduling.  I believe that 
this will serve to counteract concerns that we will not provide them fair 
market prices since they could always chose to deal directly.  We are 
confident that our prices are will be competitive and that the counterparty 
will chose to transact through us.  We would of course need to protect our 
share of the benefit in the case they transact with someone else.

Tom.

Another point:

How do we price gas/power we sell to them, especially in light of our duty of

Not expecting an answer via email, this is just a topic for further

Subject: MDEA Commercial Issues

In an effort to get the commercial terms of the contract organized and 
papered, we discussed the following issues during yesterday's meeting:

? What will be the contracted process for setting the Bogey?
? What heat rates or heat rate ranges will go in the contract?
? Can we create a schedule to collar the Bogey given a certain gas price?
? Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager? (this is a 
retrade)
? How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary 
services get accounted for in the "cost" calculation?
? How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit 
or a cost?

Regarding calculation of the Bogey, we have several issues.  First, what is 
the methodology?  Rick is very close to having a stack model that 
incorporates the business rules including minimum run times, startup costs, 
VOM, etc.  Second, what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for 
running the model?  This process will need to be documented every time the 
calc is performed.  Third, what is the timing of the calc?  We discussed 
getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a "day ahead" basis.  
Only on a select basis would the calc be re-done mid-day.

We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on 
these issues.  This should result in a set of business rules that can be put 
into the contract.

Please comment/correct/add/subtract to any or all of the above.  David 
Fairley and I will be sending out the Marketing Strategy and Trading and Risk 
Policy later this morning.

Thanks,

Reagan

 The only points Mr. Priest wished to discuss concerning the Master Agreement are  Article 2 (i,ii) "Special Fund"  and  Article 8.6 regarding Security for the "Special Fund".   The Yazoo  City charter is prohibitive regarding "Special Funds".  Mr. Priest said he would provide a resolution and or minutes regarding authority to enter into this agreement and payment.

Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?  Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

Hi Wilson,

Are you available for a conference call with David Hunt and me tomorrow?  
Maybe something in the am?

Thanks,

Kay-

According to the control room guys, "off peak" is defined as hour ending 2300 
to hour ending 0600.  They indicate that this is a NERC standard.

Kay, the natives are getting restless.  It looks like this master may need to 
take the lead in getting attention.

Subject: Master Gas Agr. for Yazoo

We need the Master Gas Agreement between Yazoo and ENA executed ASAP !!
In the last meeting, it was stated that for Clarksdale we would have the 
third party supplier invoice
the Cities directly, however once the Yazoo rehab work was completed, ENA 
would be supplying and
invoicing Yazoo.  Yazoo is near completion on the work, and has already 
burned gas in their testing over
the past weekend. I currently have an imbalance with the pipe which  I need 
to repay ASAP.  Also once the 
Yazoo unit is completed, I have NO MECHANISM to deliver the gas until we 
execute the Master Gas as
was discussed two weeks ago.

It is o.k. to schedule for someone day-ahead, however when you break it down to real time there are too many timing issues to do someone else's scheduling.  You are at their mercy of when they do the deal and it may not leave adequate time to execute.

Thanks

1.  Need details re item 1  below.  Please suggest language (band of acceptability, etc) which I will massage and incorporate.

6.  Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies?

7. Bogey calc only addresses gas.  What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil?  Does the fuel cost and heat rate change?

Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it is.  I did  a quick search and couldn't find it, but I didn't do a page turn to locate it.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject:	Open items for MDEA

[Fairley, David]  


Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement:


1. How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps..

2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.


3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

4. We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade, and those procedures apply.

5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure.

 How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities.  
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved

Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day.  

Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
[Fairley, David]  
One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  
[Fairley, David]  
This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?

What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost definition being provided separately.
 



Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. [Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. 

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. [Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem. 

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports.

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

I finally got comments back from the customer on the asset management, gas and power contracts.  I'm writing to pass along the comments which pertain to all three contracts:

Governing law must be Mississippi.

Confidentiality is limited under Mississippi law since these are governmental entities.  We are addressing it in the Energy Management Services Agreement, so it could be deleted from the Masters, or I can supercede what's in the Masters in the EMSA, or we can use the language from the EMSA in the Masters.  

Limits of liability/waivers of consequentials/waivers of implied warranties.  None of this is permitted under Mississippi law, in some cases because it is never permitted, in some cases because these are governmental entities.  I want it in the EMSA anyway, just in case the law gets better.  I'll have language for this shortly.  Basically, it is "if and to the extent [Party B] is permitted to do so under applicable law...

Arbitration.  Arbitration must be pursuant to Section 11-15-1 et seq of the Mississippi Code Annotated (1972).  In case this doesn't work they have agreed to venue in the Federal District Court in Jackson Mississippi.

Business Day should exclude State holidays in Mississippi.

Performance Assurance  needs to have "as may be permissible under applicable law", as Mississippi law restricts what they can give.

Payment: governmental entities can't be charged interest until 45 days after they receive the invoice. Also, invoices have to go on a claims docket, so the earliest they can pay is within 5 days after the first meeting of the governing board after receipt of the invoice.

Security interest.  They can't grant a security interest.


They've called a special session of the governing board to approve the documents tomorrow afternoon, so I would appreciate your input on how to handle the integration of these issues into the masters.

I expect to have the risk memo tomorrow morning.

Kay

Kay, see attached.  The monthly fee should be $13,003.  I took the $300k we have all been discussing and backed out the $12,500 they paid under the ILA terms.

More:

We need internal agreement on the cancellation fee schedule, to be included as an exhibit.

What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement?  Do we still want a master gas agreement for Clarksdale, also?  Do we want it now?

Thanks,

Subject:	Open items for MDEA

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Please see the second paragraph regarding the authority of the Cities and 
MDEA to enter into contracts.  Your opinion would be most appreciated.

Subject: FW: Contract comments

Definition of Event of Default - References Section 17.  I believe this 
should be Section 14.  This same reference to 17 is also made in other areas 
of the contract, such as in Section 15 "Termination".  Also, please note that 
under Section 15, some of the Event of Default Sections numbers do not exist 
(ie. 11 and 12).  Please look into these sections in their entirety.  With 
respect to this section, I would like to change the cure period from 30 days 
to 3 days and of course in instances of bankruptcy, misrepresenation in the 
Reps & Warr, etc., there should not a cure period.  

With respect to credit.  In reading the contract it seems that the 
counterparty is going to be a consortium of entities (MDEA, Yazoo & 
Clarksdale).  Are each of the counterparties jointly and severally liable?  
Answers to the this relationship structure will be necessary prior to 
proposing credit terms for both the Master Gas and Master Power agmts.  If 
this is the structure, we should probably look into getting legal opinions 
regarding the cities' authority to enter into such obligations.  In addition, 
do the city's have authority to enter into agreements for greater than 1 yr.  
In my experience with other munis, they generally are, but only at the 
Enterprise Fund level (Public Utility).  Perhaps we should confirm this.  To 
the extent that MDEA (stand alone) is not 100% supported by the cities, we 
will need financial statements on MDEA.

Reagan - Please forward projected load schedule when completed.

Marvin,=20
The exhibit on the Incentive Fee Calculation I just received is essentially=
 the same as we have seen before, and I still have the same overall comment=
.  Unless I have some misunderstanding, it seems to me that in a Back-to-Ba=
ck Transaction you could easily have a situation in which EPMI is making a =
profit from a transaction on which the Cities are losing money.  The "Savin=
gs per hour" on which EPMI's profit sharing is based is only the difference=
 between the Market Price (what the purchaser agreed to pay) and the Cities=
' Target Production Cost (incremental fuel cost and variable O&M).  The "Sa=
vings per hour" ignores all of the other costs that the Cities may be oblig=
ated to pay under a Back-to-Back Transaction such as transmission, ancillar=
y service, imbalance, congestion, etc. (see the definition of Costs below).=
  For example, if the Target Production cost is $40/MWh, the Market Price $=
43/MWh, and transmission is $4/MWh, the Cities would be paying EPMI a profi=
t sharing incentive fee of $1.20/MWh, while losing $2.20/MWh on the sale tr=
ansaction.  As I have noted before, the "Savings" on a transaction should b=
e as follows:
Savings =3D Revenues from the Transaction - Production Cost (base on the Ta=
rget Production Cost and MWhs) - Costs associated with the Transaction incu=
rred by EPMI or the Cities (where Costs include the items defined in Articl=
e 1 of the EMSA)
We will get back to you later with comments on the other documents. - - Al=
=20
Definition of Costs in the ESMA:=20
"Costs" means, when applicable to any Transaction, all costs, liabilities, =
fees and expenses  incurred by EPMI (excluding EPMI's internal costs and al=
located overhead) in connection with the purchase, sale, replacement, sched=

Kay, we are working on the Bogey Exhibit and the Profit/Savings Calc.  Will=
 get back with you re: items 1d. and 2.


See assignments and comments in red.  Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff responses due =
to Kay by noon today.


1)=09General comments -=20
a)=09We have not seen a draft of the MPPSA or the MGPSA for review and comm=
ent. Kay
b)=09All section references in the draft should be reviewed and checked.  T=
he majority of the references checked were incorrect. Kay
c)=09Since financial security is still an outstanding issue, all comments r=
egarding the provisions in the draft pertaining to that subject have been e=
xcluded.  Kay
d)=09The draft contains references throughout to exhibits that will be atta=
ched to the agreement that were not included in the draft.  See bleow. =20

2)=09Article 1, pages 6 and 7 - Profit and Savings: These definitions refer=
ence exhibits that were not included in the draft.   One of the most signif=
icant issues we had with the prior drafts were with the definition for "sav=
ings" so it is important to review a draft of these exhibits as soon as pos=
sible.   Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff to chech with Marvin.  He should have forwa=
rded exhibits with everything else.  time is running out on them to do anyt=
hing here.  Will report more on this issue.
  =20
3)=09Section 3.1(b): This section obligates EPMI to "Propose" a load projec=
tion and stack model.  Should this say "Prepare" as opposed to "Propose".  =
"Prepare" is fine.

4)=09Section 3.1(c): First line refers to a "request by Customer".  Custome=
r is not defined, is this intended to refer to MDEA?  If not, include a def=
inition of Customer.  "...upon request by Customer" is not necessary.  This=
 has already been done.

5)=09Section 3.2(a): Provides that EPMI will use "commercially reasonable e=
fforts".  The draft does not include a definition for this term.  Suggest i=
ncluding a definition since this standard is used throughout the draft.  Ka=
y

6)=09Section 3.2(a): Suggest adding the following phrase in the second line=
 after "schedule Products", "in a manner intended to minimize the cost of s=
erving MDEA's native load".  Adding this seems fine; however, are there any=
 legal implications, Kay?  If not, add it in.
=20
7)=09Section 3.2(c): Line 3 refers to Cajun and EPI, which are not defined =
in the draft.  Suggest including definitions or inserting the phrase "Exist=
ing Contract Resources" in place of "SEPA, Cajun, EPI".  The substitution i=
s fine.

8)=09Section 3.2(h): Line 1 provides "EPMI will optimize scheduling and usa=
ge or resale (when appropriate)".  Would suggest deleting "when appropriate=
" and inserting "(in accordance with the terms and conditions of each Exist=
ing Contracted Resources contract)".  The suggested change is OK.

9)=09Section 4.1(a): Line 1 requires MDEA to operate and maintain its nativ=
e load distribution system in accordance with Prudent Operating practices?.=
".  Would suggest deleting the phrase "and the Native Load distribution sys=
tem".  This agreement does not bear on how the cities would operate and mai=
ntain their distribution systems.  Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff

We need the Master Gas Agreement between Yazoo and ENA executed ASAP !!
In the last meeting, it was stated that for Clarksdale we would have the third party supplier invoice
the Cities directly, however once the Yazoo rehab work was completed, ENA would be supplying and
invoicing Yazoo.  Yazoo is near completion on the work, and has already burned gas in their testing over
the past weekend. I currently have an imbalance with the pipe which  I need to repay ASAP.  Also once the 
Yazoo unit is completed, I have NO MECHANISM to deliver the gas until we execute the Master Gas as
was discussed two weeks ago.

Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could 
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?  
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities 
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

Hi Wilson,

I've decided that it would be helpful to have a brief written explanation of 
what limits of liability and waivers of consequential damages are permissable 
under Mississippi law when contracting with the Cities or an energy 
authority.  Could you provide me with something along that line?

Thank you,

Kay

Gentlemen,

Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week?  I would
appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues.  I
have the lofty goal of not working Memorial Day weekend this year, so I'm
trying to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  I'm open Tues am and most of Wednesday.  I can probably work my
schedule so that I'm available quite a bit of next week.

p. 8 "Electric Transmission"  -- Would be interesting to find out what the 25 
MW of firm transmission is that Entergy "committed to."  Also, a customer 
does not have transmission until it is confirmed on OASIS.  Either PTP (firm 
or non-firm) or the additional off system resources (have to list a source) 
under network would need to be purchased for wheeling in and out of Entergy 
to make parking/lending effective. 

p.9 "Delivery Point"   --This point is actually the "POR" /Point of Receipt 
for tariff purposes if generating the power or the POD/Point of Delivery if 
wheeling into Clarksdale.

p. 10  says that EPMI would manage the existing firm transmission rights.  As 
of now, I don't think Clarksdale has the transmission rights (since Marvin is 
submitting the request today).  Therefore, for contract purposes, want to 
have language that gives them the risk of not getting transmission approved 
by Entergy.  Firm can be difficult to obtain.  Can also include a provision 
that non-firm could be used, if available, but EPMI probably does not want to 
take any transmission risk.  Non-firm is close to non-existent in the 
summer.  

p. 12  Be careful about using the term "balanced schedules" for supply, load 
and transmission capacity from all entities it serves.  We are fighting any 
RTO requirements for day ahead balanced schedules.  NERC in May is 
considering changes certain rules that would allow marketers, etc. the 
advantages of parking and lending through the submission of schedules 
(although it probably won't pass.)  In any event, I think that "appropriate 
schedules, as required by the SPP (or successor organization) rules, 
practices, etc...." is safer language.

Thanks.

Kay,  I think they will have the following questions:


3.  Liquidated Damages - does this still allow "unit contingent" power 
deals?  That is all we will be buying from them.
5.  Events of Default and Remedies - Is this OK with Mississippi law??
6.  Billing and Payment Netting - I don't think the terms will work.  Their 
boards meets the second and fourth Tuesday of each month.  Payment cannot be 
authorized until the board approves.
10.  Miscellaneous - the arbitration language is the Houston venue....


I just got your email, so I will send it anyway.

Tom -- Good point.  I am glad that you came to this conclusion.  The way the contract is written now provides that MDEA can do term deals on their own with third parties.  Our profit calcs are covered.  On the other hand, MDEA does not have the ability to do hourly and daily type deals with third parties.  We can talk about this aspect and I can give you the reasons for doing it this way.  In referring to the way the contract is written, take that comment with a grain of salt since we have not finished the contract, and a lot of areas like this may need work by our side (commercial) so that Kay can finish the doc.  Thanks -- David

I think that this will continue to be a very sticky issue for us on all services deals and I think the following is the way to handle it.

We build into all of these contracts that the counterparty may at any time, chose to transact directly with a third counterparty.  We would still administer the contracts and perform the scheduling etc. for them if they chose to do this.  In this way, the customer may always chose to deal directly if they chose and we would be doing the scheduling.  I believe that this will serve to counteract concerns that we will not provide them fair market prices since they could always chose to deal directly.  We are confident that our prices are will be competitive and that the counterparty will chose to transact through us.  We would of course need to protect our share of the benefit in the case they transact with someone else.

Tom.

Subject:	MDEA Commercial Issues

In an effort to get the commercial terms of the contract organized and papered, we discussed the following issues during yesterday's meeting:

?	What will be the contracted process for setting the Bogey?
?	What heat rates or heat rate ranges will go in the contract?
?	Can we create a schedule to collar the Bogey given a certain gas price?
?	Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager? (this is a retrade)
?	How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary services get accounted for in the "cost" calculation?
?	How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit or a cost?

Regarding calculation of the Bogey, we have several issues.  First, what is the methodology?  Rick is very close to having a stack model that incorporates the business rules including minimum run times, startup costs, VOM, etc.  Second, what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for running the model?  This process will need to be documented every time the calc is performed.  Third, what is the timing of the calc?  We discussed getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a "day ahead" basis.  Only on a select basis would the calc be re-done mid-day.

We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on these issues.  This should result in a set of business rules that can be put into the contract.

Please comment/correct/add/subtract to any or all of the above.  David Fairley and I will be sending out the Marketing Strategy and Trading and Risk Policy later this morning.

Thanks,

Reagan

Subject:  

Gentlemen,

Here are some points which require commercial et al input:

Do we intend to include gas transactions in our calculation of profit? 
[Rorschach, Reagan]  no 

We will be buying electricity to serve their load.  How should be be paid for 
those costs?  How often? [Rorschach, Reagan]  We will bill them monthly in 
accordance with the master gas and master power agreements.  (When can we get 
copies of these to MDEA). 

Jim Homco questioned whether we should buy the fuel oil.  What do you want to 
do? [Rorschach, Reagan]  Leave the fuel out of the deal. 

I've added the definition of Scheduling Equipment Costs.  How should it be 
used in the agreement?  Are we limiting our provision of scheduling equipment 
to the equipment  listed in the exhibit? [Rorschach, Reagan]   The guaranteed 
monthly fee we discuss in 13(b)(1) covers the equipment costs.  This is an 
estimate.  If we spend more than that, we need to be able to go backto Marvin 
for more money.  Rick Broussard is reviewing the equipment schedule for 
completeness. 

What financial security will be required of them? [Rorschach, Reagan]  I will 
ask Ed Sacks 

Are we attaching Marketing Strategy and Trading/Risk policy, or establishing 
a time line? [Rorschach, Reagan]  I will pull from "go-bys" from the 
Fronterra contract.  Table of contents will be made into an exhibit. 

How do we deal with the possible cost of establishing a control area?  Are we 
absorbing it?  Will there be additional infrastructure costs?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  control area is not contemplated in this agreement--we 
will evaluate and recommend.  If they want to go with a complete control 
area, it will cost more. 

Have the exhibits been updated?  If so, could I get the latest version?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will get them today. 
Kay

Wilson,

We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it be easier to work with reps/warranties?

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability  (2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same  under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for consequentials (absent a waiver)?  

Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly appreciated.

Kay

Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Good afternoon,

I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review. There 
are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal. 

Please note that  we are anticipating a Monday meeting.  Therefore, we have 
sent this out without the usual internal review.

We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly.

Talk to you soon,

Kay

Here is what I have so far, I apologize for not sending these yesterday.

1)  Definitions - 

 Fuel Costs - Refers to ET Fuel costs.  I don't think this is defined 
anywhere, and in the TECO transaction this refers to existing gas supply 
contracts.  Reagan - Does MDEA   have any existing gas supply contracts?

 As a general comment, do we need to define the cost of serving their load 
through third party purchases? 

2)  Section 2 - Term

 Whose option is it to extend the term of this deal?  It sounds like both 
parties have the right to extend, but then later in the paragraph it states 
MDEA has the right to extend.  In the TECO agreement, TECO had a unilateral 
right to extend the contract for the first year.

3)  Section 8 - Accounting and Reports

 paragraph (c) refers to Existing Transactions - I thought we were taking 
this out.

4)  Section 10 - Delivery Point and Title

 Do we need to state where EPMI delivers to MDEA?

5)  Section 11 - Fuel Management Services

  It is my understanding that at the beginning of this agreement, ENA will 
'sleeve' the gas purchases, and the ultimate goal is to help MDEA set up 
master agreements with multiple parties.  However, my interpretation of the 
statement in para (a) "The parties recognize that without MDEA's full and 
active participation....EPMI will not be able to procure fuel for the 
facilities or seek to reduce Fuel Costs,"  is that we will not be sleeving 
any gas purchases.  Is this the case?

6)  Section 13 - Payment and Fees

 It is my expectation that most months, we will be billing MDEA to pay our 
costs of serving their load, not redeeming to MDEA the Market Proceeds.  I 
think that para (a) is a little confusing because it mixes the two of these 
together.  I think it may be easier to understand if these two are broken out.

 Also, there will be times that we may have to sell off energy that we have 
overpurchased to serve their load.  We need to explicitly define how this 
will be handled.

Reagan - Here are a few comments about the exhibits:

1)  Exhibit [] - Reports

 I think I said this in my last e-mail, but the P&L, Risk Statement will not 
include 'various risk indicators for MDEA's power output for the term of this 
agreement' We may need to talk about this further.


2)  Exhibit XX - MDEA EPMI Incentive Fee Calculation

 Let's talk about this.

I'll let ya'll know if there is anything else!  

Thanks,

E

Kay,

Item 4 - of the Beck comments

The "must run" condition is when Entergy calls up and declares an emergency=

Clarksdale has to generate or they have no power.

In a previous version of the LOI David and I had the following language:

Profit from external sales of The Cities=01, power and gas resources and sa=

If not already running, =01&must run=018 periods will be excluded from the =

Something like this could go und the Structure section as item D following=
=20
the "EPMI would be compensated..." sentence which should be item C.

In an effort to get the commercial terms of the contract organized and 
papered, we discussed the following issues during yesterday's meeting:

? What will be the contracted process for setting the Bogey?
? What heat rates or heat rate ranges will go in the contract?
? Can we create a schedule to collar the Bogey given a certain gas price?
? Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager? (this is a 
retrade)
? How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary 
services get accounted for in the "cost" calculation?
? How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit 
or a cost?

Regarding calculation of the Bogey, we have several issues.  First, what is 
the methodology?  Rick is very close to having a stack model that 
incorporates the business rules including minimum run times, startup costs, 
VOM, etc.  Second, what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for 
running the model?  This process will need to be documented every time the 
calc is performed.  Third, what is the timing of the calc?  We discussed 
getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a "day ahead" basis.  
Only on a select basis would the calc be re-done mid-day.

We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on 
these issues.  This should result in a set of business rules that can be put 
into the contract.

I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the 
ILA until June 15.  

I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I thought 
I would give you a heads up.

David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.  If you have your 
preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is a spread sheet that can be used to calculate our exposure for the 
month of MAY.

Notes:

I do not have Yazoo's load so I used 80% of Clarksdale as a proxy.

I created a energy model that used a 10.5 heat rate and $5.20 gas.

The SEPA energy was not included and no cost for startups.

Looks like worst case we would be exposed for roughly One Million for May.

I can refine the model more if required.

Reagan,

I've requested the issuance of a draft master (gas) for Clarksdale.  Yazoo 
has theirs in hand, but I haven't heard any of any comments.

The power side is a bit more complicated.  Yazoo City and Clarksdale have not 
cut a deal between them to determine how to buy power - whether it should be 
bought  by MDEA (easier in some accounting respects, but credit is more of an 
issue) or by the individual Cities.  

Maybe this should be on the list for our 300 meeting.

Kay

Hi guys, 

Here's a list of questions as I'm working through MDEA.  Actually, some are 
questions, some are reminders of things you were going to send me:

Receipt Point - need def'n  RR
Load info - I was going to plug in something, or we were going to have an 
exhibit to describe.  RR
Off peak defn - RR 
transmission - we've added transmission services, but it isn't defnd.  Any 
suggestions?
scheduling equipment - do we want to refer to the list?
term - previously I was instructed to take out the evergreen renewal, now is 
it back in?  If so, is the mechanism in the first draft ok?
contracted resources - I've added in a def'n - we need a schedule. Name, 
date, subject matter of contract.

More questions to come, but I wanted to get this to you asap.  Reagan, you 
might want to look through the comments you gave me for more open items.

Thanks!

Kay

Kay,

Here is the Cover Sheet and Attachments for the above C/P.  I wasn't sure about the due diligence on the "agency relationship" so was unsure as to whether to put those riders in.  I have attached those riders so you can advise me.  The Agreement is housed in your directory minus the General Terms and Conditions.  When you are ready to send the Agreement then I can attach the GTC.

Thanks,
Genia

Here are the issues I see with their draft:

Does not allow for us to sell them power, only buy their power and sell to 
others. This means that we can't sell them power until we get the full 
contract in place.

Fuel transactions include fuel oil, and I thought we weren't managing fuel 
oil.

Incentive fee (in main contract) defined to only include the sale of gas.

Doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals.

Payment section doesn't address payment for sale of power to them from the 
market.

Attached is my completed version (subject to  a second review) which Marvin 
reviewed as I was making the changes.  Marvin  has not had a chance to 
provide me all of R. W. Beck's comments but I  trust Marvin caught anything 
that Beck had cautioned against.  The awkward  part is the fee--which can be 
determined by a combination of the  definition of Savings, the section on 
Payment and Fees, and the fee section of  Exhibit A.  If I had more time 
perhaps I could have put it together  better; but rather than start over and 
write a new structure, I tried to take  the existing structure and language 
in the LOI and the proposed Asset Management  Services Agreement.  My 
secretary and I had a very difficult time with the  margin codes, etc. but I 
believe we have it straight--at least in the 11 point  font of Times New 
Roman.
 
I will be out of the office Monday but I  trust you folks can finish this off.

OK, I see your point.  Incremental may be misleading. How about this??

"Market Price" is the price agreed to in any transaction inclusive of all costs specific to the same transaction.



 Incremental to me means an increased cost.  I'm not sure what the cost is "incremental" of.  I'm just trying to figure out if "incremental" is descriptive, or just an extra word the engineers (sorry) threw in.

Subject:	RE: Market Price definition

Incremental costs, for example, would be transmission and losses associated with a sale of power if that sale specified a delivery point away from the MDEA interconnect with Entergy.  For example, EPMI sells 22 MW from the Clarksdale unit for $40/MWh to Southern at the Southern border.  The transaction includes $4 of transmission and $0.50 of losses.  Therefore, the Market Price is $44.50.

Discussions with RW Beck have resulted in the following changes:

>From the EMSA:
"Market Price" is the price agreed to in any transaction inclusive of incremental costs specific to the same transaction.

>From the Profit Calculation Exhibit:
"Profit per hour is calculated as the product of MWh sold and the difference between Market Price and the Target Production Cost as follows:...."  (delete the reference limiting Profit to Back-to-back Transactions)

Wilson,

We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I 
hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it 
be easier to work with reps/warranties?

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability  (2) 
obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential 
damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same  
under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for 
consequentials (absent a waiver)?  

Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly appreciated.

Kay

I had spoken to Rod Clement, one of our opinions guys, about having a call 
with you, but we hadn't gotten around to scheduling it. What is your 
availability this afternoon? Both Rod and I are available.

Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

The attached ST Firm and Non-firm point to point transmission agreements are 
"blankets" that do not commit Clarksdale to any costs or transmission until 
they reserve transmission on OASIS.  However, once Clarksdale signs up for 
network, it will be obligated to pay (more like a demand charge each month).

1.a)  "EPMI will use this Network service .... and will arrange for any other 
transmission service...

Who will pay for such transmission?  Just want to make clear in the doc.

OK, I see your point.  Incremental may be misleading. How about this??

costs specific to the same transaction.



 Incremental to me means an increased cost.  I'm not sure what the cost is=

descriptive, or just an extra word the engineers (sorry) threw in.

I spoke with Marvin today, he has comments on the LOI.  David Hunt will 
finally be available on Wednesday to work with Kay to address legal issues.  
Bob Priest is recommending Enron to his board tonight.    Due to their peaker 
deal with Aquilla, they have been unable to make progress on our LOI, so it 
will not be presented at his board meeting Tuesday night.  He has them on 
notice that special meeting may be called to execute the LOI as early as a 
week from today.  He would like to be in agreement on the LOI issues by the 
end of this week.

He has the following comments on the LOI:

? page 4 paragraph 8, "negotiate" rather than "negotiates"
? we need clarification on the mechanism by which Enron will recover 
infrastructure costs.  He wants to make sure that Enron cost recovery is out 
of our 40% and backed up by a guaranteed monthly minimum calculated as the 
amoritized capital costs over the contract period.
? he wants more detail on the $50k breakup fee.  What are the circumstances 
that would precipitate a payout?
? David Hunt and Kay Mann need to get together (he indicated that David has 
been unavailable) to address the legal issues including limitation of 
liability and arbitration such that they agree with Mississippi law.
? he needs some specifics on the ancilliary services (load following, 
regualtion, and reserves).

On the last issue, he indicated that this is the "deal maker/breaker."  He 
offered that our competition indicated that their regulated side would be 
providing those services.  He needs to know from Enron who we would contract 
with to do it--"we can horse trade on the price later."  I indicated that we 
have not given specifics to the market in searching for ancilliary services, 
and were waiting on the LOI before we asked for proposals.  He wants 
specifics--other than pricing--before he signs the LOI.


After talking with Ozzie and Lloyd, here is the game plan:

? get the Entergy tariff and price the ancilliary services with Entergy as 
the provider
? find out who the high-load-factor IPPs are in the Mississippi area
? put calls in to those IPPs as well as CLECO, LEPA, SMEPA, Cajun, Alabama 
Electric Power Co-op, and Entergy and guage interest and potential pricing 
for providing ancilliary services
? we will need approximately 4 MW of regulation service, load following and 
reserves.  We would send the signal and communicate with the ancilliary 
service provider.
? Once we have gathered some preliminary information, call Marvin on 
Wednesday and let him know that we expect to go with Entergy during the first 
60 days beginning May 1 and select/negotiate/contract with one of the above 
for the balance of the contract.  In no case would the pricing be higher than 
the entergy tariff rates.

I would like to have Christi and Lloyd available for the call to Marvin.

How does all this sound??

Forgot to make a note on the below.  I think that we need to be consistent 
with terms in the EEI Master Power and Master Gas agmts.  I'm not sure if we 
have sent drafts (without credit terms) of these documents, but think that we 
should probably include Schedule M to the EEI since we are dealing with 
government entities.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, but can be 
reached by cell (713) 446-8711.

Definition of Event of Default - References Section 17.  I believe this 
should be Section 14.  This same reference to 17 is also made in other areas 
of the contract, such as in Section 15 "Termination".  Also, please note that 
under Section 15, some of the Event of Default Sections numbers do not exist 
(ie. 11 and 12).  Please look into these sections in their entirety.  With 
respect to this section, I would like to change the cure period from 30 days 
to 3 days and of course in instances of bankruptcy, misrepresenation in the 
Reps & Warr, etc., there should not a cure period.  

With respect to credit.  In reading the contract it seems that the 
counterparty is going to be a consortium of entities (MDEA, Yazoo & 
Clarksdale).  Are each of the counterparties jointly and severally liable?  
Answers to the this relationship structure will be necessary prior to 
proposing credit terms for both the Master Gas and Master Power agmts.  If 
this is the structure, we should probably look into getting legal opinions 
regarding the cities' authority to enter into such obligations.  In addition, 
do the city's have authority to enter into agreements for greater than 1 yr.  
In my experience with other munis, they generally are, but only at the 
Enterprise Fund level (Public Utility).  Perhaps we should confirm this.  To 
the extent that MDEA (stand alone) is not 100% supported by the cities, we 
will need financial statements on MDEA.

Reagan - Please forward projected load schedule when completed.

=09=20
=09
=09On the surface, the dispute between the Municipal Energy Agency of =20
Mississippi (MEAM) and the Clarksdale/Yazoo City alliance appears to be =20
about money and contracts. Yazoo City and Clarksdale say they are pulling =
=20
out of the eight-city energy-supply association because they can provide =
=20
power to their cities less expensively on their own.
=09
=09MEAM says that they have the right to do this, but only in accordance  w=
ith=20
the original MEAM contract, which specifies that an entity can only  withdr=
aw=20
from the agency on condition of five years=01, written notice. This  provis=
ion=20
is typical of this type contract and lends a degree of stability  to a=20
coalition of political bodies.
=09
=09Complicating the matter is the fact the MEAM has financed the upgrading =
 of=20
the generating facilities at Yazoo City and Clarksdale. The total  project=
=20
upgraded three frame-five gas turbines and added three waste heat  recovery=
=20
steam generators and cost in excess of $10 million. Part of this  project w=
as=20
paid for by MEAM revenues and the rest by a $5 million 1994  bond issue.
=09
=09The Greenwood generating facility was also part of this project, but =20
Greenwood elected to pay out of other resources rather than participate in =
=20
the bond issue. This leaves seven cities responsible for the bond issue  an=
d=20
dependent on the generating capacity of the two cities for a portion  of=20
their electrical power supply.
=09
=09MEAM also purchases power from other resources to supplement the  genera=
ting=20
capacity of Yazoo City, Clarksdale and Greenwood. SEPA, Cajun  Electric=20
Cooperative, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and Entergy Services, Inc.  are amon=
g=20
recent suppliers with Entergy holding the largest contracts.
=09
=09The exit of Yazoo City and Clarksdale from MEAM would hurt the  organiza=
tion=20
not only in loss of generating power but also in the loss of  volume=20
purchasing power from other supplies. This type loss is one of the  reasons=

for a five-year notice in the original contract. The other cities  involved=

in MEAM would be given time to deal with the adverse impact.
=09
=09Clarksdale and Yazoo City, however, say that MEAM has broken its  contra=

of the savings that they perceive to be available in the  deregulated=20
wholesale energy market. They also plan to buy out the bond  issue obligati=
on=20
from MEAM and finance it through revenue bond issues of  their own.
=09
=09At this point the story breaks down into two other issues. One is a  ver=
y=20
legitimate difference in style of operation and management between  MEAM an=

the two cities. The other is a rather obvious problem with power, =20
personality and disgruntlement.
=09
=09Neil Davis, General Manager for MEAM, admits to being conservative in  h=

management style. "I=01,m the first to say we=01,re not where we=01,d like =

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

FO means Forced Outage -  A forced outage event shall be deemed to occur when 
an equipment failure, operator intervention or other action or inaction 
occurs that causes the Facility to reduce output from the current full 
capacity of the Facility either directed by operator action or is the result 
of a Facility control and/or safety system action.
PO means Planned Outage   A planned outage event shall be deemed to occur 
when the Facility operates at reduced output or is removed from service by 
the Facility operator in a controlled manner so as to allow maintenance of 
equipment, systems or the entire Facility where the event was part of the 
annual maintenance planning.
MO means Maintenance Outage   A maintenance outage event shall be deemed to 
occur when the Facility operates at reduced output or is removed from service 
by the Facility operator in a controlled manner so as to allow maintenance of 
equipment, systems or the entire Facility where a partial or full outage of 
the Facility is required to permit the correction of a discovered problem 
that could, if uncorrected, cause a forced outage or result in damage to the 
Facility or create a hazardous condition for Facility staff or the local 
community and, where the outage can be effected so as to occur during a time 
when the outage effect on the system or contracts associated with the system 
can be minimized.

Attached is my completed version (subject to  a second review) which Marvin 
reviewed as I was making the changes.? Marvin  has not had a chance 
to?provide me?all of R. W. Beck's comments but I  trust Marvin caught 
anything that Beck had cautioned against.? The awkward  part?is?the 
fee--which can be determined by a combination of the  definition of Savings, 
the section on Payment and Fees, and the fee section of  Exhibit A.? If I 
had?more time perhaps I could have put it together  better; but rather than 
start over and write a new structure, I tried to take  the existing structure 
and language in the LOI and the proposed Asset Management  Services 
Agreement.? My secretary and I had a very difficult time with the  margin 
codes, etc. but I believe we have it straight--at least in the 11 point  font 
of Times New Roman.
?
I will be out of the office Monday but I  trust you folks can finish this off.

The following are my comments:

  - I assume that Settlements is fine with invoicing no later than the 7 th 
of each mth.
  - Section M:  Should we go this route (covenant of financial support) or 
would we be accomplishing the same if we structure this as MDEA, agent for 
..., similar to that in the Interconnection Agmt.  We should probably look 
into it further for the longer term deal.  I don't know which has the 
stronger fall back to the municipalities.

Kay,

We had a good conversation with Marvin and Bob today regarding the ancilliary 
services.  They liked the strategy of going with Entergy (although they were 
nervous about some of the people we might have to deal with) and looking at 
other alternatives.  Initially our empahsis is to get them up and running 
without delay.  Any other plan would not be prudent. 

They would like to have the LOI reference our plan to provide the ancilliary 
services.  Not play attorney again but....can we add some language like the 
following:

Ancilliary Services:  EPMI would arrange for The cities to contract for 
ancilliary services with Entergy in accordance
with the Entergy tariff for an interim period beginning May 1, 2001.  During 
that interim period, EPMI would solicit ancilliary proposals from other 
control areas, as feasible.  If an alternate to Entergy is identified, EPMI 
may recommend that The Cities contract with the alternate for the balance of 
the EPMI term.

Christi has reservations about this maybe not having enough wiggle room for 
us, and I agree. There are a few other places in the LOI we will need to 
reference the ancilliary management responsibility EPMI is contemplating.

Also, I think this creates a need to have a definition of ancilliary services 
in the LOI.

We have a meeting scheduled with Entergy for Tuesday morning to discuss Enron 
buying ancilliary services.  Further I have called several of the other 
control areas (CLECO, Alabama Electric Co-op, NRG, SMEPA, and LEPA) to assess 
their interest in providing ancilliaries and wait for return calls.

Marvin promised to light a fire under David Hunt ASAP.  You should already 
have heard from him.

I will call you tommorrow.  Thank you very much,

Reagan

In an effort to get the commercial terms of the contract organized and papered, we discussed the following issues during yesterday's meeting:

?	What will be the contracted process for setting the Bogey?
?	What heat rates or heat rate ranges will go in the contract?
?	Can we create a schedule to collar the Bogey given a certain gas price?
?	Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager? (this is a retrade)
?	How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary services get accounted for in the "cost" calculation?
?	How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit or a cost?

Regarding calculation of the Bogey, we have several issues.  First, what is the methodology?  Rick is very close to having a stack model that incorporates the business rules including minimum run times, startup costs, VOM, etc.  Second, what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for running the model?  This process will need to be documented every time the calc is performed.  Third, what is the timing of the calc?  We discussed getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a "day ahead" basis.  Only on a select basis would the calc be re-done mid-day.

We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on these issues.  This should result in a set of business rules that can be put into the contract.

Please comment/correct/add/subtract to any or all of the above.  David Fairley and I will be sending out the Marketing Strategy and Trading and Risk Policy later this morning.

Thanks,

Reagan

Reagan,

Specifying it is for infrastructure costs may cause heartache.  

Don't worry, I'll do the legal work!

Kay

Subject: Infrastructure Costs

Kay:  Based on my conversation with Marvin, I think he is looking for 
something like this:

EPMI would be guaranteed a monthly minimum fee as reimbursement for 
infrastructure costs calculated as the amoritized capital costs over the 
contract period.  The monthly minimum will be considered to be met provided 
EPMI's 40% share exceeds the monthly amoritized cost calculation.  Otherwise 
"The Cities" agree to pay the shortfall between the guaranteed minimum and 
the profits acrued to EPMI during the particular month.

Just thought I'd communicate it a little better after I thought about some 
more.  Try it on for size, see what David thinks, ....

Thanks,

Reagan

I've recopied below Miss. Code Ann. Sec. 77-5-727. Subsection (u) appears t=
o answer your question, at least as to purchases of electric power. I'm not=
 aware of anything under the joint action agancy law that empowers the enti=
ty to buy gas on behalf of its members.

Section 77-5-729 provides authority for the member utility to contract with=
 the joint agency to purchase power. It's recopied below as well.

I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really help move the document along.  I'll ask again if i can get it from him. There are still internal questions in it, which I have annotated. I'm happy for you to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive commercial direction.

Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.  I know the bogey calc doc is a bit rough. [Rorschach, Reagan]  Exhibits are rough.  I need to make a list of Exhibits called out in the current doc version, pull them all together, and clean them up. 

Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff? [Rorschach, Reagan]   Yes.  I am not exactly sure of the context....but try this on for size:  Clarksdale is subject to an Entergy transmission constraint that from time to time results in a transmission cut and mandates Clarksdale dispatching their generation assets to serve Clarksdale Native Load.  Dispatching Clarksdale assets under these circumstances is known as the first contingency must run condition.  During first contingency must run conditions, EPMI will document the production costs, megawatts generated, duration of the event, and lost opportunity cost of buying from the market.  Clarksdale is due reimbursement from Entergy for extra costs incurred during such events. 

Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge problem days for me.  When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?  Anyway to combine the two at once, given the short timeframe? [Rorschach, Reagan]  I think we could get everyone together at the same time as soon as Monday.  I want them to have the time to study the document so we can get it all done at once.  

Has Dave signed the extension, by the way? [Rorschach, Reagan]   done, fedex'ing to MDEA.  Will have faxed copy today.

Kay,

We are starting to run into some scheduling constraints for next week, at least with Bob Priest.  I'd like to get together with Bob and Marvin early next week to discuss the agreement--moving toward finalizing before June 12.  Bob is only available Monday.  Bob and Marvin think it is a good ideal to then meet with RW Beck.

I'd like to email Marvin and Bob the next version sometime today?

If you want me to write up the complete definition for each of these, let me 
know

If you have questions, let me know


Receipt Point definition(s)


FOR POWER

The receipt point and delivery point definitions are identical as they apply 
to MDEA proper at the Entergy - MDEA interfaces.

The receipt point and delivery point definitions for EPMI and third-party 
transactions should be as defined in each individual deal/transaction 
Confirmation.

(IE, you have four power definitions)


FOR GAS

The receipt point for gas is defined in each individual deal Confirm where 
gas may be purchased, and then transported to MDEA.

There are 3 delivery points for gas:

for Clarksdale it is the interconnect between Texas Gas and Clarksdale

for Yazoo City you have (a) the interconnect between Southern Natural Gas 
(Sonat) and Mississippi Valley Gas for the Yazoo City Power Plant (Sonat 
Delivery Point)
                                   (b)  the interconnect between Mississippi 
Valley Gas (MVG) and the Yazoo City Power Plant (MVG Delivery Point)



Off Peak Definition

This is the same definition as the ON PEAK definition, except the off peak 
hours beginning and ending are the opposite of the on peak hours.


Transmission Services

Transmission Services means the analysis and/or procurement of transmission 
capacity as part of the Scheduling Services by EPMI as MDEA's Scheduling 
Entity.



Scheduling Equipment

Suggest either don't refer to a list at all, or you can say such equipment is 
included in the list of equipment on the Exhibit ?, but try to name the 
specific equipment.


Term

It is simply my preference to let the one year term evergreen automatically 
each year unless prior notice is given by either party.  I don't think anyone 
else has a particular preference, unless you do.  Don't know if MDEA has a 
preference on this.


Contracted Resources

Thought we had an Exhibit for this already called Off-System Contracted 
Resources, so I will get it to you separately in a few minutes.  We also have 
a blank Existing Transaction Exhibit.  I thought that we might blend the 
Contract resources and the Gas Transportation Agreements into the Existing 
Transaction Exhibit.

Subject: List of questions

Hi guys, 

Here's a list of questions as I'm working through MDEA.  Actually, some are 
questions, some are reminders of things you were going to send me:

Receipt Point - need def'n  RR
Load info - I was going to plug in something, or we were going to have an 
exhibit to describe.  RR
Off peak defn - RR 
transmission - we've added transmission services, but it isn't defnd.  Any 
suggestions?
scheduling equipment - do we want to refer to the list?
term - previously I was instructed to take out the evergreen renewal, now is 
it back in?  If so, is the mechanism in the first draft ok?
contracted resources - I've added in a def'n - we need a schedule. Name, 
date, subject matter of contract.

More questions to come, but I wanted to get this to you asap.  Reagan, you 
might want to look through the comments you gave me for more open items.

Thanks!

Kay

Jeff and Kayne,

Attached are the contract Exhibits for Asset Management Services and 
Scheduling Services.  Please look at each bullet item and write some specific 
detail about what it is exactly we are committing to.  The driver behind this 
is the legal position Mississippi law puts us in with respect to 
consequential damages--we need to be very clear about what it is we are going 
to do.  For example, it is not enough to say that we will do "load 
forecasting."

We need to put the detail behind "load forecasting."  For example  ..."EPMI 
will create a load forecasting model and perform load forecasting for MDEA 
using historic energy load data and corresponding historic ambient 
temperature data provided by Clarksdale and Yazoo City.  The model will be 
based on the highly positively correlated realtionship between energy load 
and ambient temperature.  Energy load will be forecasted using the National 
Weather Service forecasted temperatures for the Clarksdale and Yazoo CIty 
areas.  The energy load at each city will be forecasted seperately and 
aggregated as the MDEA energy load.  The MDEA energy load forecast will be 
calcualted weekly and revised daily."

Let me know what items you cant ake and I'll get help on the rest.

Thanks,

Reagan
