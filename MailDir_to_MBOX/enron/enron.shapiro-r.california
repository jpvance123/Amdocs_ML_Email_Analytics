Highlights:

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
In giving its first hint on what it will do with the PX credit process, it 
said "we will proceed to reexamine and redesign the direct access credit 
system to reflect current structural reality."  (Translation - no 
market-based PX credits)
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law). Responsibility for residential 
subsidy is split one third each to residential, commercial, and industrial
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers put in place.  No increase up to 130% of 
baseline (first 2 tiers), rate for fifth tier (above 300% of baseline) is 
about doubled.
Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into 
summer on-peak were rejected.  About 60% of increase put into summer.  
Industrial customers get a bill limiter which caps the average increase for a 
given customer to 12.3 cents/kwh for PG&E and 12.9 cents/kwh for SCE.
Real Time Pricing was endorsed - will further explore in workshops starting 
later in May.  Voluntary program will be started.
Federal facilities will be subject to a market rate pilot program.
Utilities are directed to specifically state on each bill the energy charges, 
including the 3 cent surcharge


Below is a more complete summary of the CPUC decision on the PG&E/SCE rate 
increase (prepared by Jeanne Bennett).

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon 
of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the 
"core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to 
brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution 
for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in 
legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) 
will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will 
be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., 
core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address 
(e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is 
what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," 
comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a 
comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to 
the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue 
its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue 
requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be 
suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to 
review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 
15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and 
will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed 
decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of 
the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the 
Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

The feeling on the street is that Reliant was setup with the $1900 sale.  The 
word is that the bid for $1900 power had been sitting there for months and 
that Reliant had an "understanding" with DWR and the ISO that the bid was not 
supposed to be taken except in dire need -- it's for a peaker and the price 
represents the opportunity cost of running it now, and using up its very 
limited emission credits, rather than running it during the real peak times 
this summer. The $1900 represents the estimated cost to Reliant of Reliant 
having to buy power this summer on the market when it otherwise would have 
had its peaker available.  The wors is that the state/ISO took the bid, when 
there was not dire need, just to make Reliant look evil and point to ever 
higher prices -- when? -- yes, the week before the Bush plan was to come out.

Press Release

Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for 
Solutions

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2001--Reliant Energy strongly disagrees 
with California Governor Gray Davis' recent characterization of the company 
as being ``obstructionist'' and opposing court orders. 

Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated 
attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing 
the state's energy crisis. The accusations are simply not based on fact. More 
importantly, the governor's attacks have done nothing to increase the state's 
supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer. If 
anything, the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and 
uncertainty that have further destabilized the market. 

``Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations 
and focus on true solutions to California's energy shortage,'' said Joe Bob 
Perkins, president and chief operating officer, Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group. ``We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market, 
not government control of power generation, and we have offered solutions 
that do not jibe with the governor's political agenda. Contrary to the 
perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote, we have been focused on 
providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the 
outset of this crisis. In fact, earlier this week we provided the governor's 
office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that, if pursued 
quickly, could help mitigate the power crisis this summer. We are still 
waiting on a response.'' 

Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the 
lights on in California, disputing the accusation of being 
``obstructionist'': 

Reliant Energy has run its 30-to-50-year-old plants at the highest levels 
since their purchase in 1998. In 2000, Reliant nearly doubled the output from 
these plants to meet the needs of Californians -- running them at levels far 
exceeding the prior owner, Southern California Edison.

Reliant Energy invested $80 million dollars in 2000 alone to upgrade plants 
to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times. In 
addition, the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment 
and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum.

For the last two years, Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities 
and the state to invest in long-term contracts to stabilize rates instead of 
relying on the spot market. In particular, Reliant Energy offered to sell 
power at two cents per kilowatt-hour if the buyer would purchase the natural 
gas required to generate the power, ensuring a transparent cost of power.

Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns 
that continue to exist over credit issues. In contrast, just last week a 
major out-of-state supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless 
payment was forthcoming.

Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage 
businesses to ``sell back'' power voluntarily to add more power to the 
Western power grid. The company has met with many leaders in Western states 
to introduce the program, yet California officials will not even engage in a 
dialogue on the program. 

``We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one with the 
governor,'' Perkins said. ``Unfortunately, he has repeatedly refused this 
request over the past year. Last week's meeting with generators was the first 
time the group was allowed to speak with him directly, and obviously the 
purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding.'' 

Perkins added that the governor's accusations of opposing court orders are 
unfounded. ``We have always worked within the law and are proud of our 
commitment to keeping the lights on. We have followed all court orders and 
worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all 
investigations. When necessary, we have filed court challenges to orders that 
we believe violate our rights -- hardly an illegal action.''

Here's an editorial that gets to the heart of the matter.

Ghost of Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol 
Gray Davis is following footsteps of former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos




JOHN M.W. MOORLACH 
Mr. Moorlach is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector. 

A recent L.A. Times poll found that Californians still remain unconvinced 
that our state suffers from a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's 
subsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five months has 
caused us to believe that everything is fine. It is not. 
The state has been spending an average of $57 million, a medium-sized city's 
annual budget, per day for electricity. Now California is headed toward the 
same financial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholder-owned 
utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and another on the 
precipice. At this pace, it will not be long before the state will be staring 
a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face. 
That's why I'm gnawed by this "d,j. vu" sensation. The similarities and 
parallels between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are 
frightening. Here's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer 
Robert Citron, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. 
The "experts" and the "politicos" were comfortable with the investment 
scheme. 
No wonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing 
improprieties. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how 
he was investing and what his "exit strategy" would be. Guess what? The 
unexpected happened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of 
borrowing suddenly exceeded the revenues being generated. 
It caused the investment pool to implode and Orange County taxpayers realized 
a $1.64 billion loss. In spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck 
the county's leadership, he ignored it. The rest is history. In a 
half-pregnant deregulation scheme, the state capped the retail price that the 
utilities can charge. It also eliminated the availability to acquire 
electricity through the use of long-term contracts. 
Guess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for electricity 
spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It depleted the 
available funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are imploding. In 
spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray Davis to avoid or 
minimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also history. 
It gets worse. Davis doesn't allow for the immediate raising of retail rates 
and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess what? The 
expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves! Nearly $9 
billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled! 
And in the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced 
and only compound this financial nightmare. Gov. Davis has done what no 
Libertarian or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He 
has returned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of 
California by subsidizing their electricity bills. 
Bravo! It may not be the most equitable way of refunding taxes, but has 
anyone ever thought up a more efficient method? But, that's not all. He wants 
it back! Davis now wants to borrow some $13 billion to replace the spent 
reserves and purchase even more electricity at rates in excess of the retail 
prices! When does this train wreck in slow motion stop? 
And how do we pay off these bonds? Davis did not want to raise rates last 
summer or this past winter. But now he will to pay off this historically 
largest municipal bond offering with a significant utility rate increase. The 
ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davis is gone about his 
expensive brilliance. And this elected official wants to purchase the power 
grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say "no." 
If we don't show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond buyers 
will also say "no," unless they receive an attractive interest rate. Just ask 
Edison International about attractive interest rates. It just subscribed $800 
million in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. Davis walked into his 
position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangible legacy to 
show for it. No reserves. No improved highways. No new schools. No 
infrastructure improvements. Only interest payments. 
Wasn't that Citron's legacy? If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent, the 
citizens of California will pay an additional $4.4 billion in interest costs. 
Over 15 years it's $6.7 billion. And therein lies the true legacy of Davis, 
squandering the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting 
from his indecisiveness and lack of leadership! 
It is so tragic that the perpetrator of this colossal mess is still in denial 
and continues to play the "blame game." Orange County played the "blame 
game," too. But it had obvious perpetrators and succeeded in a court of law 
in securing a significant amount in retribution payments. I'm not so sure 
California will have a similar result.

All:

Attached is the latest version.    Note the average price of power assumed 
purchased by the DWR, if smoothed to a fixed price equivalent for the 9.5 
years beginning 7/1/01, is $106/mwh and $104/mwh if DWR's forward price 
curves are used.  We used a range of $82.75 to $104/mwh in our sensitivity 
page.   The $82.75 is the mid-point between Henwood and DWR curves.   Enron's 
curves are significantly lower on the back-end.   The other switch is for the 
allocation of the past utility purchases: 1) one pro rata, and 2)  one where 
the non-core shares prorata, plus half the core's portion.  DWR past 
purchases are handled pro rata in both scenarios.


Regards,


Michael

I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers 
never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a 
compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date 
certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a $/mwh basis.

Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid 
balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge.   I 
know that this is a very long shot.  We should make this recommendation as a 
help to our business teams even if we are going to lose.

Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday?

Subject: Draft Bond Legislation Language

As discussed, we have two possible approaches:
1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 
days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order 
establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power 
delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction 
of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by 
suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to 
the effective date of this legislation.
We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be 
exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the 
duration of the turmoil.
Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15.  Thus 
if the wording gets changed to "who are taking delivery as of the effective 
date of this legislation" we have failed.
Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.

2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct 
such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue 
requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the 
revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond 
revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR 
bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.
Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If 
we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.

Harry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be 
necessary to ensure timely recovery....
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.
The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.

Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:
IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR 
costs.
SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, 
would be subject to a surcharge.
I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the 
clause "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."
Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the 
bond is paid off; or
Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the 
bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]
Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001

If it is possible, we should advocate:
Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such 
that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the 
amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.

And we should get a legal interpretation of  "The DWR Bond Charge shall take 
precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund 
and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 
2001."  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.

Scott

In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending 
Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to 
suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers.

The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to 
make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already 
paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC).
The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC 
credit.
The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of 
payment or would be permanent.
The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E.

The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now 
have a bill credit receivable.  In addition, because EES re-sourced its 
customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the 
customer account.  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill 
credit is to utilize the Utilities' services.  Even if EES physically serves 
the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill 
credit.  

The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is 
unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case.

We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) 
trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us 
payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow 
us to be paid if our account became "inactive".

One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE 
management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to 
route the economic value to our DA customers.  

If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss.

Greetings:
As folks heard, Ken Lay met with some California CEOs last Friday back East.  
As a result of that meeting, McNealy, CEO for Sun, asked for some background 
and more detail on what Ken Lay proposed as a solution for California during 
his meetings in California over the past couple of weeks.  McNealy and others 
have expressed a willingness to make phone calls to policymakers, etc. to try 
to advance the ball.

I pulled this together very hastily on Friday and take responsibility for all 
errors, omissions, ramblings, etc.  Wanted to distribute, however, to make 
sure that all had the info that is getting distributed.  Know folks are busy, 
but this will likely get distributed to other CEOs this week, so any 
comments, suggestions, etc. about how to improve are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

It's bad, and it'll get worse/TROUBLE AHEAD: Extra power for summer will fall 
well short of Gov. Davis' promise
Carolyn Said, Chronicle Staff Writer


   California will get only one-third of the new power that Gov. Gray Davis
promised to deliver by July 1, virtually ensuring a brutal summer of
blackouts for the energy-strapped state.
   Davis had pledged to take emergency measures to get 5,000 extra megawatts
up and running by summer. Instead, the state will have 1,698 megawatts of
the promised new power by July 1, according to the California Energy
Commission. Even by Sept. 1, California will have added just 3,669
megawatts.
   The goal of 5,000 megawatts -- enough to power 5 million homes -- was
crucial because it represents the gap between expected supply and demand
this summer.
   "We're still hopeful we can get as many megawatts online this summer as
possible," said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. "But we understand there
are issues involved in the siting and construction of new power plants."
   In fact, experts said, there are so many obstacles that the governor's
plan was unrealistic to begin with.
   "There are limits to what you can reasonably accomplish," said Arthur
O'Donnell, editor and associate publisher of the California Energy Markets
newsletter.
   Without a way to plug the gap between supply and demand, California can
expect a long, dark summer.
   "Any warm day from May to October -- it doesn't even have to be abnormally
warm -- California is going to be at risk for blackouts," said Michael
Zenker, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy and
economics consulting firm based in California.
   He predicts that rolling blackouts in the state this summer will be "in
the hundreds of hours. I expect Californians will grow pretty weary of
them pretty quickly."
   The California Independent System Operator, which oversees about 85
percent of the state's straining grid, has said that anytime its load hits
40,000 megawatts or above, California will be at risk of involuntary
outages. Last summer, that mark was reached on 34 days.
   Whether this summer will exceed that number of days or not depends heavily
on the weather. If it's a cool summer, California might squeak by with
relatively low power demand and fewer blackouts. If the mercury rises,
electricity use will soar as people crank up their air conditioners, and
the lights will go off for tens of thousands of customers at a time.
   This week's warm temperatures and concurrent rolling blackouts are a clear
harbinger of a pattern expected all summer. Although power plants that
were offline for maintenance aggravated the situation, the week's two
blackouts "tend to indicate that the blackouts we'll have as we get
further into the summer will be deeper and more sustained," said Zenker.
   Exacerbating the state's inability to generate enough homegrown power is
the situation in the Pacific Northwest, where drought conditions are
severely curtailing hydroelectric production, meaning that California
cannot count on imports this summer.
   The state's next best hope for coping with the warm weather will be
enticing consumers and businesses to raise their thermostats, shut off
their lights and shift their heavy usage to "off-peak" hours.
   "To avoid blackouts in California, we're going to need conservation," said
Jim McIntosh, director of operations for the ISO.
   Cutting consumption by 10 percent could get 5,000 megawatts off the grid,
according to Davis. And the Energy Commission says that various measures
enacted last September, such as incentives for businesses to paint their
roofs white (reducing their air-conditioning needs), will save 281
megawatts by June 1 and 334 megawatts by August. The governor's latest,
$800 million campaign to encourage conservation could save an additional
2,061 megawatts by summer's end.
   But energy experts say Davis may be overly rosy in his projections for
cuts in home consumption.
   That's because the expected rate increases for electricity won't hit until
June, so customers would first see a spike in their bills in July.
Psychologically, many people will start serious conservation measures only
once they've taken a hit in their pocketbooks.
   Although Californians have already cut back enough to save 2,866 megawatts
during April, "I don't think more (conservation) will happen," said
Michael Shames, head of the Utility Consumers Action Network. "Markets
move slowly when it comes to changing energy conservation patterns."
   Davis's ambitious building plan took several routes to add up to 5,000
megawatts. In part, it relied on three huge power plants -- Los Medanos,
Sutter and Sunrise -- that had already been under construction for years
and are certain to come online this summer. But much of it was based on
getting dozens of small energy providers to either increase output or
build new facilities. Those efforts foundered on several issues:
   -- QFs: Davis was counting on getting dozens of so-called "qualifying
facilities" -- or QFs, basically small alternative energy generators -- to
ramp up production. That, plus restarting of two existing power plants,
would have added 1,244 megawatts. Instead, most QFs will produce only the
bare minimum, and one of the power plants may not be restarted.
   The QFs, which are paid directly by California's utilities, are still owed
millions of dollars for power they produced in December and January. And a
new payment scheme enacted by the California Public Utilities Commission
will slash payments for power they generate in the future. QFs say they
will actually lose money if they run full tilt because they can't recoup
their natural-gas costs.
   -- Peakers: Small, temporary power plants called peakers accounted for 2,
133 megawatts of Davis's plan. Although the Energy Commission sped up
licensing for peakers, many firms were competing for scarce resources to
get the mini power plants built.
   "There's an internal competition (among power firms) for transmission
interconnections, for natural-gas pipeline space, for turbine parts,"
O'Donnell said. "I felt a fairly large amount of optimism was built into
(the peaker plan) to begin with."

Calif. regulators propose tiered electric rate rise
(UPDATE: Adds details throughout)

SAN FRANCISCO, May 9 (Reuters) - The California Public Utilities Commission 
on Wednesday proposed two plans to increase electricity rates in the 
power-starved state through a tiered retail pricing system.

The parallel plans, submitted by an administrative law judge and CPUC 
President Loretta Lynch, are designed to encourage energy conservation by the 
24 million customers of PG&E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG - news) Pacific Gas & Electric 
unit and Edison International's (NYSE:EIX - news) Southern California Edison 
subsidiary.

Higher rates also would allow the state to begin to recover money from 
utility bills to pay for power it has purchased on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities, Lynch said.

The plans are expected to be voted on Monday by the five-member CPUC. 
Approval would implement the commission's March 27 move to raise retail power 
prices to help recover soaring costs of wholesale power.

The March decision did not specify how the rate increases would affect 
different classes of electric customers.

The plans, announced by Lynch, would raise rates 20 percent to 50 percent for 
commercial and industrial customers, and 41 percent to 48 percent for all 
electricity used by residential customers in excess of a percentage of their 
existing base usage.

Lynch told a news conference, however, that up to half of California's 
residential customers who meet certain conservation targets would not face 
higher rates.

Electricity rate hikes for agricultural customers served by PG&E and SoCal 
Edison would be capped at 23 percent to 30 percent, she added.

Paul Clanon, a CPUC energy director, said the rate plans would raise $5 
billion this year from utility customers, with some of the money channeled to 
the California Department of Water Resources, which is buying electricity on 
behalf of the state.

The CPUC has not decided, however, exactly how much of monthly utility bills 
would flow to the agency.

California's power purchases this year have drained the state treasury of 
some $6 billion.

The state Senate on Wednesday approved a bill to issue $13.4 billion in bonds 
to pay for emergency power and sent the measure to Gov. Gray Davis, who is 
expected to sign it.

The Senate's approval came two days after the state Assembly passed the power 
bond measure as a piece of regular -- rather than emergency session -- 
legislation, meaning California will have to wait at least 90 days to issue 
the debt.

The bond issue aims to repay the state for the power purchases, with the debt 
to be paid off over 15 years through a portion of the monthly utility bills.

The Governor signed SBX2 85 (Burton) into law today.  The measure prohibits
the CPUC from raising rates for residential and small businesses upon
termination of the 10 percent rate freeze if the rate hike is solely the
result of the rate freeze ending.  There is some confusion as to when the
bill takes effect because the Assembly never adjourned the Second
Extraordinary Session.  In a special session, bills take effect 90 days upon
adjournment of session.

A Company (who has not agreed to go on record, but Smutny knows who it is) 
has decided not to build two planned power plants in CA because of all the 
uncertainty and the threat of the windfall profits tax.  Instead (and I'm not 
making this up), the Company is sending the two turbines to Bulgaria!

California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and Assemblymember Barbara  Matthews 
(D-Tracy/Stockton area), held a press conference today to "introduce"  two 
new "whistleblowers" from Duke Energy's South Bay plant.? Bustamante  and 
Matthews have filed a class action suit against out of state energy  
companies.
?
The two employees, E. Robert Edwards (who spent 22 years at  the plant as an 
electrician) and Richard J. Connors (21 years, started as a  laborer and rose 
to auxillary operator), said they had little new to offer but  were there to 
back up the testimony of the three former plant employees who  testified 
before Sen. Dunn's committee.? Among their claims were that the  plant did 
not run at its potential capacity during periods of rolling blackouts,  that 
part supplies were reduced or removed to slow maintenance, and even that  the 
emphasis on safety was reduced.? 
?
Edwards said that?the?225 MW Unit 4 was kept offline  during a period of 
rolling blackouts.? He also said that Units 1 and 2 were  run at 100 MW 
instead of their 150 MW capacity.
?
Connors noted that units were taken offline on weekends, and  that employees 
"dreaded" Sunday night-Monday morning shifts because "they would  have to run 
around" to bring units on line.? A Duke spokesman said after  the press 
conference that they do shut down some of the units on weekends  because the 
state doesn't need the power and the cost of production is higher  than the 
market price.
?
The employees also claimed that one turbine which uses liquid  fuel was used 
more than they ever remember in place of steam turbines.?  Connors said the 
15 MW generated through the use of jet fuel, oil, etc. could  have easily 
been produced by making adjustments to one of the operating steam  turbines.
?
Ray Boucher, the attorney on the case, said the alleged  actions could 
violate anti-trust laws.? He claimed that documents say Duke  bought the 
South Bay plant because they knew it would enable them to exercise  market 
power.
?
Bustamante dismissed the ISO's confirmation that it had  ordered the plant 
to?ramp?up and down during Jan. 16-18, the period  discussed by the three 
previous whistleblowers.? He said that Duke's  withholding of electricity and 
bidding practices had affected how the ISO had  been forced to manage power, 
and that it is essential to examine bidding records  during that period.
?
Boucher said even though the state is looking at $9 billion in  alleged 
overcharges, the class action suit could ask for more.? "I think it  goes 
deeper than that (the $9 billion)," he said.
?
Bustamante made two incorrect statements during the press  conference.? He 
tried to bolster the credibility of Connors and Edwards by  saying that they 
had been kept on the job for two years after the plant's  takeover by Duke, 
which shows their value.? He was reminded that AB 1890  required keeping 
existing employees for?two years.? (Connors said he  was offered employment 
by Duke but turned them down; Edwards indicated he took  an enhanced 
severance package.)
?
The second was in regard to a claim by one of the former  employees that he 
had been told that the spare parts supply had been reduced in  order to lower 
"inventory taxes."? Bustamante made the comment, "We don't  have an inventory 
tax."? It's true that California no longer taxes  inventory (in retail 
stores, for example), but counties do charge an ad valorem  tax on on-site 
business property.
?
I sat a couple of seats away from Tom Williarms, spokesman for  Duke, 
who?made under-the-breath comments?through most of the press  conference such 
as "That's so wrong."? Following the press conference, he  held an 
availability in the hallway.? He said that there was a fundamental  
difference in operation the employees didn't understand:? The South Bay  
plant now serves the ISO market, while it used to serve a targeted southern  
California market under SDG&E.? Williams also claimed the plant was  under 
severe environmental constraints for NOx that limited its available run  time.
?
Duke, he added, did not want to charge the high prices -- over  $3,000/MWh 
--?it did but included an 80% credit premium because the  utilities were not 
creditworthy.??To date, he said,?it has only  received 1.8 cents on the 
dollar.??Williams said Duke?tried to  sell the power to DWR instead at a much 
lower?rate, but was  refused.?Duke has since refunded some money, Williams  
said,?and?has offered to re-bill at FERC's price-mitigation  rate.

Folks:

Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous 
note.  Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.  It's the copy 
that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

P.S.  Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load; 
Hertzberg has it at about 20%.

FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key 
outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The 
administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC 
and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via 
utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this 
Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now 
looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems 
that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.  Go 
figure.

Best,
Jeff

Mike:

I regret that we had a difficult call yesterday.   We greatly appreciate the 
good work that you do and the commitment you and your firm have to our 
company.  Moreover, I recognize that the legislature is a difficult 
environment and that there is substantial pressure on you and Sandy.  I also 
recognize that needs and demands can change quickly and, at times, our RCR 
process can be difficult!

All that said, however, the Government Affairs group has an obligation to use 
our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective 
manner.  The RCR process helps us satisfy that obligation..  

>From our conversation yesterday and a later call with Sandy, it appears that 
there is some confusion on how we will use the RCR process to contract for 
legal support for our legislative efforts.  Hopefully this e-mail will 
clarify the process so there is no confusion in the future and so that you 
can feel comfortable you are undertaking work that is authorized and for 
which we have a budget.

1.  To begin, it appears from your e-mail yesterday that Goodin, MacBride has 
billings as of May 11 for approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall 
profits, the "Global Settlement," and Power Plant Siting.  With respect to 
this work, I recognize that there may have been confusion about our budgeting 
and RCR approval process.  These billings will be included in the 
RCR-approval requests discussed below.  

2As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May was 
conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place.  As you know we 
terminated the two legislative retainers at the end of April.  No RCRs were 
filed to cover the matters on which work was completed in May.    

I did receive a budget on legislative matters on May 8.  However, a decision 
was made only yesterday to proceed on a specific matter-by-matter basis.  The 
work in May should not have been undertaken while we considered whether to 
proceed with an overall legislative budget or proceed with specific RCRs.  In 
short, the proposed budget was not RCR approval.  

In the future, any work undertaken by Goodin MacBride should only be 
conducted pursuant to an approved RCR.  If an emergency arises--i.e., an 
issue arises that could not have been contemplated, we can get emergency 
approval for work necessary to respond to the emergency.   Please contact me 
in the event of an emergency.  I can be reached through my office 
line--503.464.7945, pager--888.916.2262, or cell phone 503.539.4733.  If I 
can't be reached, please contact Jim Steffes.  Jim's pager number is 
888.906.9676.  Note that both Jim and I wear the pager at all times and 
respond immediately to messages left on the pager.  

3.  Pending RCR approval for the matters identified below, I have asked 
Goodin MacBride to participate in the Direct Access coalition meetings taking 
place today and tomorrow.  In a discussion with Sandy yesterday, I agreed 
that Goodin MacBride should participate in a telephonic conference on the 
Calderon bill.  

4.  To the maximum extent possible, you should include Leslie Lawner in 
future Direct Access Coalition meetings, conference calls, legislative 
drafting efforts, etc.  

5.  If there is any confusion on whether there is RCR approval for a 
particular matter, please contact me before undertaking an assignment.  If I 
am unavailable, please contact Jim Steffes.   

6.  Today, Sandy is filing several RCRs for legislative support on Direct 
Access, Siting, Windfalls Profits, and the Global Settlement.  They will be 
considered at next Monday's RCR conference call.  If they are approved, Sandy 
will manage the Goodin MacBride assignments associated with Direct Access, 
Siting, and Windfalls Profits.  

7.  Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement, 
whether it is legislative or not.  This does not mean that Sandy cannot give 
assignments to Goodin MacBride that involve the Global Settlement; it simply 
means that before that work begins Jeff must approve the work.  

This particular issue is a critical matter for our company.  Jeff is involved 
in the strategy and business calls concerning this matter and is working on a 
daily basis with Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean to develop our 
position and advocate that position in the settlement discussions.  We must 
ensure that our Sacramento efforts are fully coordinated with our strategy 
and business interests (as they develop through the settlement 
discussions).   To avoid any confusion on the scope of Jeff's responsibility, 
I consider all legislation addressing the Edison MOU, any future MOUs with 
Sempra, and "Plan B," to be part of the Global Settlement.  

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  
Again, we appreciate your hard work and commitment to our efforts.  

Paul Kaufman

here are direct answers to your questions.

		 Subject: Final Commission Decision on 3c/kwh Rate Design

Harry and / or Jeanne,
Can you send us the written ruling?  We'd like to read it as well.

Do the rate increase apply to direct access customers?  No.

Does it still consider the "rate freeze" in existence?  Yes.

Are there peak charges for certain rate class customers?   There is a "bill 
limiter" that limits an industrial customer's average rate increase to 12.3 
cents for PG&E and 12.9 cents for SCE (per kwh).  Generally, summer on-peak 
got a greater % increase but did not bear the whole brunt of the increase.

Does it go into effect retroactively?  Effective June 1, retroactive to March 
27.

Does it say anything about the prior 1 cent surcharge?  Does not apply to 
that surcharge.

Is there reference to Direct Access eligibility?  No.  Direct access has not 
been ended.

Please help us with this information asap. 

Thanks

Subject: Final Commission Decision on Rate Design

At the continuation meeting held this afternoon, the Commission voted out
the Alternate Proposed Decision on SCE/PG&E rate design.  The vote was 3 to
2, with Bilas and Duque voting "no".

Absent a close reading (which I have not had the opportunity to do yet), it
is difficult to discern all the changes made to the alternate as it was not
put out in a red-lined form.  While the version voted out today contains a
lot more verbiage supporting the previously made resolutions of the issues,
the only real substantive changes made appear to be (1) it lowers the cap on
agricultural customers rate increases from 30% to 20% for agricultural TOU
customers, and to 15% for agricultural non-TOU customers; and (2) it places
an average rate increase cap on industrial customers.  For PG&E, this
average rate increase cap is 12.3 cents/kWh; for SCE its $12.9 cents/kWh.
The decision does not contain alot of explanation on the industrial cap.  I
am assuming that the "average rate increase" refers to the average across
TOU periods.

I will review the Decision more closely, providing a complete summary
tomorrow.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please call.

Jeanne Bennett

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the 
business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in 
number to follow).  

Jim

Deregulation not to blame but Davis is: His inaction allowed a problem to 
become a power, and fiscal, crisis
By Pete Wilson 
(Published June 3, 2001) 

The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of 
hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a 
sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand. Five years ago, when 
deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature 
(and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer, 
including then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis), California enjoyed an excess of supply 
over demand amounting to some 30 percent. 
Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition; first, to drive 
down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and, 
second, to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new 
generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and 
keep in California all the jobs that it would produce. 
And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in 
applications to build power plants, especially after the effective date of 
the legislation in 1998 and the defeat that year by California voters of 
Prop. 9 (which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation). The total megawattage 
of the filings for 1998 doubled that for 1997. After the effective date 
(March 1998) of the deregulation legislation, AB 1890, and the defeat of 
Proposition 9 (November 1998), removing the threat of repeal, the total for 
1999 was double that of 1998 -- exceeding the 5,000 MW mark in '99 alone. 

Just look at the filings for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 in the California 
Energy Commission graph (above). Far from causing the problem of energy 
shortage, as the Davis administration charges, deregulation caused providers 
to file -- by mid-2000 -- applications to build new power plants that 
promised to add 10,000 megawatts to California's power supply. 
That's why I signed it. 
I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB 1890 -- 
just as I (and every other governor in history) signed other bills which, 
though imperfect, promised significant and needed beneficial change from the 
status quo, which was certainly true of deregulation. 
No one could have anticipated in 1996 the combination of factors -- less 
hydroelectric output in the West, warmer summers, sharply higher electricity 
demand, constraints on natural gas supply -- that turned an electricity 
surplus into an electricity problem by 2000. The reason we will suffer power 
blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction 
allowed a problem to become a crisis. Now the power crisis threatens to 
become a state fiscal crisis. 
Governor Davis has been quoted as saying, "If I wanted to raise rates, I 
could have solved this problem in 20 minutes." Sadly, by temporizing on 
needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis, he 
made crisis inevitable. As a result, California bonds have suffered two 
downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies, and he has put in jeopardy state 
spending for parks, schools, transportation and other capital needs. He has 
been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state 
budget. 
The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in 
electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years, which 
gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation, or 
the curtailment of production of natural gas, which led to price spikes in 
recent years. It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting 
agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century. 
It ignored a 1998 warning by the California Energy Commission of possible 
energy shortages by as early as 2000. And when possibility became hard, hot 
reality in San Diego in 2000, it continued to ignore it, putting in place a 
political, palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem. 
Fully a year ago, or earlier had he chosen to do so, Governor Davis could 
have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of 
California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency, including 
explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy. These powers 
include the suspension of statute and regulation. It was this power that I 
used after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 to rebuild and reopen Los 
Angeles' shattered freeways -- just 64 days after their destruction, instead 
of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required 
by law. 
Fully a year ago, Davis could have acted unilaterally, without the 
Legislature, to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investor-owned 
utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) recently complain of but eagerly requested at 
the time of enactment. 
He could have, by decree, suspended the provision that prohibited the 
utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers. 
He could have, by executive order, suspended and truncated the nightmarish 
process required by state law for approval of siting. Had he done so early 
enough, when he might even have made a difference this summer, and done so 
not just with peaker plants but also with large plants, he might have greatly 
accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow 
us to escape from blackouts, power price spikes and the severe job loss and 
economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither 
reliable nor affordable. 
All these actions, Governor Davis could have taken a year ago -- or earlier: 
A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to 
prevent it. He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it. 
Had the governor heeded the early warnings -- about hot weather, or the 
threat of insolvency to the utilities -- and had he acted, using the full 
range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have, he could 
have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become. 
We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast 
enough to avoid blackouts this summer. 
PG&E would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern 
California Edison would not be teetering on the brink. 
Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels. 
The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers' dollars. 
And California's jobs would not be threatened, as they are, by raiders from 
other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California 
employers to their states and steal our jobs. 
The blame game waged by the governor's office adds insult to injury. It will 
provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer. But it 
does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to 
mislead those who are not aware of the real, unhappy facts of California's 
present crisis. 
The honest explanation for it is simple, not rocket science: State government 
cannot ignore the law of supply and demand. It is not the state's 
responsibility to build power plants. But it is its responsibility to create 
a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers 
to do so. Deregulation, even with imperfections that the governor could have 
cured by fiat if the need arose, was a significant advance in achieving that 
incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest. 
The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of 
Governor Davis' failure to act. That is the plain, unhappy truth of the 
matter. I take no joy in saying so. I have been prepared to be helpful to the 
governor during this very serious challenge to our state's well-being, just 
as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition 
39 (the school bond issue) in the most recent election. 
Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him 
then, I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and 
a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in 
order to shift the blame for his own inaction. 

Pete Wilson is the former governor of California.

		 Subject: Rate design for 3 cent Rate increase for PGE/SCE

2 proposed decisions were released last night by the California PUC - one by 
the Judge and one by Chairman Lynch.  

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law).  Each decision allocates a 
substantial portion of the subsidy to non-residential classes, although Lynch 
does this to a lesser extent
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers will be put in place; the 5th tier (300+% 
of baseline) gets a 35 cent per kwh rate
Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into 
summer on-peak were rejected.  About 60% of increase put into summer.  
Real Time Pricing was endorsed - will further explore in workshops starting 
later in May.  Voluntary program will be started.
In a vindictive outlash, Lynch decision requires federal facilities to pay 
market prices under new schedules to be developed by the utilities
Judge's decision seems to require surcharge to show up as a separate line 
item; Lynch's decision requires that it not be shown separately

Oral argument occurs Friday and final decision is expected to be voted out 
Monday, June 14.

California Changes Stance on Refunds 
Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks 
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, July 6, 2001; Page E01 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity, saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations.
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise.
"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told 
reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday.
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at 
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, 
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid 
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in 
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for 
all sides, is closed to the public and media.
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and 
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the 
parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report 
confirmed by sources close to the talks.
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant 
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for 
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers 
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off 
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's 
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but 
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California's 
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher 
refund figure, some energy analysts believe.
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an 
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have 
to pay for energy under those deals.
California's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed 
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at 
volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so 
did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating 
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so 
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power 
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was 
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and 
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy 
analysts say.
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political 
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's 
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that 
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count 
as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," 
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. 
"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said 
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" 
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the 
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.
"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," 
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight 
committee for the California grid.
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room 
"billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, 
sources said.

I spoke with Scott Miller yesterday about several issues, so of course 
California came up.  Scott expressed frustration with the California 
situation and indicated that he thinks California will never be able to move 
away from its current problems without a comprehensive solution, led by an 
entity like the Administration.  Scott said he thinks all the parties need to 
come to the table and reach some sort of agreement to net out the differences 
between what suppliers are owed and what California thinks it is owed in 
refunds.  Once that is accomplished, the parties would then agree to enter 
into 1-3 year supply contracts at agreed-upon prices for the bulk of 
California's power needs.

Scott has been floating this idea with his colleagues (unnamed) who countered 
with "Would Ken Lay agree to something like that?"  I told him that I agree 
there needs to be a comprehensive solution to California but I did not know 
what Enron would agree to.  I asked him if he has heard anything about the 
Vice President's task force and whether the report will propose something 
like this.  Scott indicated that he and his group have had no contact with 
the task force and he has no information as to what will be in the report.  
This workout plan is just Scott's idea for now.

Scott said he thinks the current scenario is unworkable, that there is not a 
lot of internal support for Hebert's approach, and that things will get 
worse.  For example, Scott said that although generators are the only 
suppliers subject to cost justification at present, if the problems continue, 
marketers will be subject to the same cost justification in the future.

I thought you all would be interested in this conversation.  I told Scott 
that since Joe has changed jobs, that he should feel free to call me with 
questions or to talk about things like this, and he also told me to call him 
whenever we need him.  Although Scott is not expecting a response from us on 
his California idea, if we do have some sort of response, we may want to 
convey it to him just to show our interest in working  with him and his group 
and that we have a similar interest in resolving the problems in California.

Subject: DWR Stranded costs: $21 billion

I pulled the recent forward curves (confidential; not for external release 
without approval from West Power) and computed the stranded costs associated 
with the DWR contracts.  Assuming SP15 on peak (which is conservative since 
many of the contracts had off peak energy in them) the total overmarket is 
$21 billion, or $13 billion discounted at 12%.  The former number is most 
comparable to the $40+ billion DWR expenditure commitement number.

If we want to use this for any sort of external message I would like to 
refine further.

I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 
24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one 
that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 
100% of the utilities' past debts).  As folks know, the cost shift provision 
of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.

The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have 
recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.  They 
are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have 
requested that I be part of those negotiations.  They are not sure that 
Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.  They will 
get back to me when they find out.  I'll report back soon as I hear 
something.

quickly put into a few power point slides for use in meetings he's having 
this week at the gathering of the Business Council (back East) with a group 
of California CEOs (e.g., Sun, Chevron, Amgen, Bechtel and others).  This is

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more 
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group 
of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has 
aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of 
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private 
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to 
Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the 
Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per 
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & 
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour 
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 
an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for 
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and 
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. 
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, 
according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased 
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more 
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest 
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have 
reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. 
"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the 
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% 
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging 
us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting 
ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on 
the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's 
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first 
quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the 
first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's 
energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited 
to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the 
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. 
"All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since 
his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in 
January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to 
$271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded 
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one 
of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per 
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a 
total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a 
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average 
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of 
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be 
reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, 
the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered 
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, 
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see 
the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached 
Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing 
the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, 
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas 
prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, 
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems 
in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state 
projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June 
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under 
$100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited 
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term 
power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry 
closer to normalcy."

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail
By Daniel Taub 
Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray 
Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity 
market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a 
misdirected e-mail. 
The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was 
intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve 
Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press 
list, he said. 
Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would 
compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a 
state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and 
confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is 
buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. 
``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a 
meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail 
contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. 
According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of 
electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough 
electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged 
from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the 
e-mail is accurate. 
Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a 
megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to 
Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot 
market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher 
than on the day-ahead market. 
The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a 
quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each 
season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law 
requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.

Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and 
apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and 
Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a 
comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). 

In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides 
more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly 
challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much 
more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. 

That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the 
plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of 
August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough 
time to let the expedited "appeals process" under (SB37?) run its course in 
time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant 
energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides 
refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  
This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and 
now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.

Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting 
the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as 
soon as I have more information on that.

Best,
Jeff

The memo to investors says that a new law will take effect on Aug 13 that 
puts in place shortened appeal times at the CPUC.  The memo says that the 
CPUC does not need to act on the key issues, including suspension of DA, 
until Aug 13 or later.  It also says the bonds are now to be sold in 
Sept-Oct. The memo states that the CPUC, Governor, Treasurer, etc. have 
agreed with the new timetable.

Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small 
customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal 
that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the 
MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  
The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not 
yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting 
attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is 
attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on 
the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by 
customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the 
generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, 
investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts 
and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the 
bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong 
possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX 
labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to 
include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate 
has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds 
to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. 
AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "modified MOU."  
Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their "modified" 
MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an "informational" hearing on the bill tomorrow 
(Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, 
with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on 
Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, 
July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get 
resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional 
comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie 
Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in 
Sacramento.

                             May 15, 2001
***FERC launches formal hearing in El Paso case
     A collection of high-powered attorneys crowded a FERC hearing 
room yesterday for the launch of a formal hearing into 
allegations of market power abuse by El Paso and its affiliates. 
While a decision is still a way off, the presiding judge in the case 
made it clear that FERC must find a precise way to measure market 
share in California before ruling on the case.
     The hearing also marked the public release of a controversial 
market power study by The Brattle Group, which was commissioned 
by Southern California Edison to find evidence of market power 
abuse by El Paso marketing affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. The 
Brattle Group said that it found substantial evidence that El Paso 
manipulated California's gas market -- a claim that remains 
strongly in dispute (see story, page 4).
     In an opening statement, FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge 
Curtis Wagner laid down the parameters for the hearing. The 
burden of proof, he said, is on the California Public Utilities 
Commission, which filed the original Section 5 complaint against 
El Paso. But once a case is made, Wagner added, "the burden of 
going forward with evidence to rebut that case shifts to El Paso 
Merchant and the parties on its side of the table."
     The case originated last year, when the CPUC asked FERC to 
abrogate a series of transportation contracts between El Paso 
Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant. The California regulators 
claimed the capacity award was rigged, and further complained of 
a conspiracy to drive up the delivered price of gas into California.
     In March, FERC dismissed the CPUC's claim that there was 
favoritism in the bidding process for El Paso pipeline capacity (GD 
3/29). But the commission also sent the case before an ALJ, saying 
the case raised larger questions of market power. According to 
FERC, certain disputed issues of fact need to be examined at a 
hearing before a decision can be rendered.
     One of the biggest issues will be determining whether the 
affected market is the entire state of California or whether it is 
just Southern California. The CPUC and Southern California Edison 
maintain that only the Southern California market is at issue, 
while El Paso argues that the case applies to the entire state.
     The outcome of the case could hinge on that distinction. As 
Wagner noted in his opening remarks, "The question of the 
geographic market makes a tremendous difference in how El Paso 
Merchant's market share will be measured and the results."
     If the entire state is considered as a single market, said 
Wagner, then El Paso Merchant would have a market share that, 
depending on methodology, would range between 17% and 26.8%. 
But if the CPUC's contention that the market is Southern 
California holds up, he added, then El Paso Merchant's market 
share would be between 35% and 44.9%.
     Finding out whether market power exists also depends on how 
many players are involved in a particular market. Wagner said 
that the parties need to reach a stipulation among counsel on the 
number of players. In addition, he said that he would need a better 
geographic description of El Paso Merchant's capacity holdings 
and information on the price differential of gas between Northern 
and Southern California. 
     Finally, Wagner directed a number of questions to El Paso. El 
Paso Merchant, he said, "should answer the CPUC's question as to 
why it subscribed for the involved [1.2 billion cfd] for 15 months 
when it had no market for that amount." In addition, said Wagner, 
El Paso should "show whether it sold in the secondary market 
short-term releases of the excess [capacity] at a price higher than 
it paid."
     Wagner also heard arguments over the admissibility of certain 
evidence.
     Given the volume of testimony involved, the case will require 
some legal heavy lifting before a preliminary decision is reached. 
Noting that he received a nearly two-foot high stack of testimony 
last week, Wagner said that reading prehearing briefs and 
prepared testimony "consumed a very beautiful Sunday in 
Washington." (RP00-241)     NH

***El Paso takes aim at Calif. Assembly, study
     In an effort to clear its name in the ongoing California market 
power controversy, El Paso is going on the offensive. The company 
yesterday issued a riposte to claims -- publicized by California 
Assembly members and major newspapers -- that it manipulated 
California gas prices. And it took close aim at The Brattle Group, a 
consultancy that has figured prominently in various 
investigations into the matter. 
     According to El Paso, The Brattle Group worked "hand-in-hand" 
with a California Assembly subcommittee to pin the blame on El 
Paso and its subsidiaries for the run-up in gas prices in the 
Golden State. El Paso furnished copies of internal Assembly e-mails 
as proof that the subcommittee did not seek to conduct an 
objective investigation. 
     As reported in Gas Daily, The Brattle Group's study of alleged 
market power abuse by El Paso marketing arm El Paso Merchant 
Energy has been exhibit A in California pipeline litigation (GD 
4/25). In a study commissioned by Southern California Edison, The 
Brattle Group concluded that El Paso had deliberately manipulated 
California-bound pipeline capacity in an effort to drive up the 
price differential between production basins and the California 
border.
     Drawing in large part on The Brattle Group's opinion, the 
California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight recently 
concluded that El Paso caused the price run-up (GD 4/20). 
Representatives of the Assembly's Democratic majority said The 
Brattle Group study proved conclusively that the rise in gas 
prices at the California border was greater than could be 
accounted for through normal market forces.
     But according to El Paso, the subcommittee majority was -- 
deliberately -- wrong. The inquiry conducted by the subcommittee, 
said El Paso, was a "charade that was orchestrated from the 
beginning" to shore up SoCalEd's case.
     "El Paso has recently obtained, through discovery in a 
proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
correspondence between the staff for the subcommittee and the 
paid litigation consultant [The Brattle Group] for Southern 
California Edison," said El Paso in a statement. "This 
communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's 
conclusions were pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's 
failed energy policies."
     The correspondence included apparent requests from 
subcommittee staff members for help in "rebutting" El Paso's 
testimony before the Assembly. El Paso interpreted those requests 
as proof that the subcommittee majority "never intended" to write 
an objective report on the matter. 
     "We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its 
responsibilities to [SoCalEd's] consultants," said Norma Dunn, El 
Paso senior vice president of communications and government 
affairs. "We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified 
before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise 
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we 
learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of 
[SoCalEd's] litigation consultants to support SCE's litigation 
position." 
     Litigation pitting SoCalEd and the California Public Utilities 
Commission against El Paso is currently under way at FERC (see 
story, page 1). Following yesterday's hearing, Dunn told Gas Daily 
that SoCalEd and the CPUC were also waging their campaign against 
El Paso in the   national press. 
     The New York Times, for instance, has published articles that 
relied on The Brattle Group study and other sealed documents. 
Dunn said it was "clear" that SoCalEd and the CPUC were using the 
selective leak of documents to take the case against El Paso to the 
public. 
     Prior to recess in yesterday's hearing, FERC Chief 
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner issued a reminder of the 
need to restrict access to protected documents.     NH

El Paso Calls California Subcommittee Hearing a 'Sham' 
El Paso Corp. claims it was set up by California Assembly members to take the 
blame for high gas prices in the state. It said recent hearings before a 
subcommittee were a "sham," and that it was "predetermined" that El Paso 
would be accused on wrongdoing in a report approved by the subcommittee 
majority yesterday. 
While El Paso battled similar accusations at the opening of hearings 
yesterday before a FERC administrative law judge, the company publicly 
contested the results of the majority report (approved 3-2) of the California 
Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight, which placed the blame on the 
energy company for skyrocketing gas prices in the state. The majority report 
says El Paso drove up gas prices by withholding pipeline capacity from the 
market, focusing on the same year-old capacity contract between El Paso's 
pipeline and marketing affiliate that is the subject of FERC's investigation. 
Contrary to the majority report, however, are the conclusions of a report 
prepared for the two Republican members of the five-member subcommittee. That 
document said the hearings "produced no conclusive evidence" of price 
manipulation. 
Although the majority report has not been made public, "it is clear, based on 
accounts of the report and recently uncovered documents, that the 
subcommittee hearing was a sham," El Paso said in a statement. 
El Paso released to the public yesterday documents containing e-mail 
correspondence between staff members of the subcommittee and members of the 
Brattle Group, a paid consulting firm for Southern California Edison. The 
Brattle Group is one of El Paso's main opponents at the hearings this week 
before FERC's Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. Brattle 
accuses the company of costing Californians an additional $3.7 billion in gas 
costs over the past year. 
The correspondence El Paso released reveals a close relationship between the 
consulting firm and the subcommittee staff. For example, a staff member said 
to Brattle Group's Matthew O'Loughlin, "I can't thank you and Paul enough for 
your testimony. It was beyond expectations, the members were highly 
impressed. The chairman asked me if you guys could stay and help us with a 
second day. We could have used it." 
El Paso said the communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's 
conclusions were "pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's failed 
energy policies." The subcommittee majority was working "hand-in-hand with, 
and relying on, SCE's consultant, the Brattle Group, in their so-called 
analysis," El Paso said. "In communications between the subcommittee staff 
and SCE's consultant, it is clear that SCE's consultant assisted in preparing 
questions for the hearing and that the subcommittee staff requested 
assistance from SCE's consultant in preparing the final report. 
"That the subcommittee majority never intended to conduct an objective 
investigation is clear... [R]ather than write an objective report based on 
the testimony, the staff went on to ask SCE's consultant for help in 
'rebutting' El Paso's testimony." 
"We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SCE's 
consultants," said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of Communications and 
Government Affairs for El Paso. "We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff 
and testified before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise 
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we learn that 
the subcommittee was working at the direction of SCE's litigation consultants 
to support SCE's litigation position. We are particularly concerned that 
after coordinating the questions to be asked, the Brattle Group testified 
before the subcommittee as if it were an independent group. It is obvious 
that the subcommittee hearings were a charade that was orchestrated from the 
beginning. Final conclusions were drawn before we had an opportunity to 
testify and then the final report was leaked to the press instead of provided 
to us, so that we would not have an opportunity to react." 
Dunn said El Paso is confident that once the facts are presented to FERC in 
hearings this week, it will be "vindicated." 
However, El Paso also faces an uphill battle in Washington. The FERC hearings 
pit El Paso and its subsidiaries against the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the state's two largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas 
& Electric and Southern California Edison. 
The regulators and the utilities also allege El Paso withheld capacity on its 
pipelines into the state, which in turn pushed prices up. If the charges are 
substantiated, FERC Judge Wagner could order the company to refund any money 
it earned due to price or supply manipulation. Such a ruling could have even 
broader implications because skyrocketing prices for natural gas, the single 
biggest source of fuel for power plants in California, obviously contributed 
to the financial calamity that brought Southern California Edison to its 
knees and sent Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. 
The details of the charges are well known at this point. Critics alleged that 
El Paso Merchant Energy Gas LP and El Paso Merchant Energy Co. received 
inside information on a discount transportation rate that enabled them to end 
up the big winners in an open season in February of last year. The open 
season involved 1.22 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso to the California 
border. 
But in an order on complaint, FERC found "no merit in the allegations." It 
cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the bidding for capacity to favor 
its affiliates. Moreover, it said there was no evidence that El Paso violated 
its standards of conduct. However, the Commission did not dismiss the 
allegations that El Paso engaged in market and price manipulation. It set the 
market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and ordered him 
to provide an initial decision within 60 days (see Daily GPI, March 29). 
FERC staff also appears to be hot on El Paso's tracks. In testimony submitted 
last week before Judge Wagner, FERC staff's expert witness concluded that El 
Paso probably exercised market power in the Southern California gas market 
and drove up gas prices over the past year when pipeline capacity constraints 
existed. FERC Economist Dr. Jonathan D. Ogur concluded that under certain 
circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in the Southern 
California gas market (see Daily GPI, May 14). 
The rise in California natural gas prices is not attributable to El Paso, the 
company said in its statement yesterday, but is attributable to the fact that 
demand for gas has far outstripped supply. Evidence presented at the 
California subcommittee hearings shows that El Paso has consistently utilized 
its pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to California and has never 
restricted supply. Constraints on gas infrastructure in the state have 
limited the supply of gas during a time in which demand has risen 
dramatically, the company said.

FYI.  Please keep confidential until further notice.  Important to note that 
this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the 
specific language.  It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to 
get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., 
Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the 
Legislature as soon as possible.

In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed "rate 
agreement" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's "revenue 
requirement" next week.  I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison 
and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.  It's 
going to get very interesting from here.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: FYI:  TWO PRESS RELEASES TODAY FROM GOVERNOR DAVIS...


FYI, more of the same from the Governor's office.  Also, I have received a
couple of calls about whether it is true that Senator Dunn rescheduled the
generator hearing this week that had previously been cancelled.  The rumor
is true, but it is my understanding that the discussion has been occurring
directly between Dunn's office and individual lawyers for involved
generators, so I can't really add anything substantive to the mix.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/27/2001 
GOVERNOR DAVIS SWITCHES ON NEW ERA IN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY HISTORY 
Governor Opens First Major Power Plant in CA Since '88 
KERN COUNTY 
With the flick of a switch, Governor Gray Davis launched on a new era in
California's energy history by ceremoniously switching on the 320 megawatt
Sunrise Power Project in Kern County. Sunrise is the first major power plant
to come on line in California since 1988. 
"We are taking control of our energy destiny," Governor Davis said. "This is
the first major power plant built in California since 1988. It's clean,
efficient and it was built in record time."
The Sunrise Power Project is jointly owned by Edison Mission Energy and
Texaco Power and Gasification. Edison Mission Energy has agreed to sell the
power generated at the Sunrise plant to California's Department of Water
Resources under a long-term contract at a reasonable rate. By the summer of
2003, the plant is expected to produce 585 megawatts.
"We're building more new power plants than at any other time in our
history," Governor Davis said. "Next week, I will be cutting the ribbon on
the 500 megawatt Sutter power plant near Yuba City. It will be the largest
gas-fired power plant built in California in a generation. Over the next two
weeks, we'll be bringing a combined total of more than 1,300 MW on line -
enough to power the entire city of San Jose." 
In the 12 years before Governor Davis took office, not a single major power
plant was licensed in California. Under Governor Davis' leadership,
California has licensed 16 major power plants and 10 "peaker" plants.
Sunrise is the first of four scheduled to come on line this summer. 
The combination of these new power plants, with additional renewables,
distributed generation, and re-rates of existing power plants, will bring
more than 4,000 new megawatts online by the end of September. At no other
time in the history of California have so many new power plants been under
construction and in the pipeline.
Construction began on the Sunrise Power Project on December 7, 2000, making
it operational in a record 6 and a half months. The construction force
worked 18 hour days, six days a week, and the plant was brought on 32 days
ahead of schedule. Because the plant was completed before July 1, it is
eligible for more than $1 million in construction incentive payments under
the Governor's Executive Order (D-32). 
"None of this would have been possible without the commitment of Edison
Mission Energy, Texaco, and a dedicated construction force," Governor Davis
said. "I would like to commend Black and Veatch, ARB and the State Building
and Construction Trades Council for moving heaven and earth to bring this
project on line ahead of schedule. If not for your Herculean efforts, we
would not be here today."

Executive Summary
? New Extraordinary session opened today
? Forbearance period extended for SoCal
? QFs placing liens on SoCal, moving them closer to bankruptcy
? MOU is dead.  Nation's Plan B, an alternative to the MOU, will become a 
bill tomorrow and is gaining interest from both sides of the House.  SoCal 
and Davis has yet to give their support.

New Extraordinary Session
Yesterday, the Senate and Assembly passed resolutions to close the 
Extraordinary Session.  All bills from the 1st session be introduced into the 
2nd session as they were last amended, with the same bill number.  

Forbearance Period Extended
Regarding the forbearance extended to SoCal by banker creditors, the parent 
company's credit has been extended until 30 June.  The utility's forbearance 
is until 15 September.

QFs Placing Liens on SoCal's Assets
The QFs are placing liens against SoCal's assets (property or freezing its 
bank assets).  As a result, SoCal is moving ever closer to bankruptcy, maybe 
as early as later next week.  These actions on behalf of the QFs are added 
incentives for the legislature to move quickly on an alternative to the MOU.

Alternative Plan to the MOU
The MOU for SoCal is essentially deal.  There are a number of alternative 
plans being proposed.  The legislature held meetings last night on Democratic 
Assemblyman Nation's Plan B alternative to the MOU.  This plan is gaining 
momentum.  According to sources, Republican Assembly leader Cox has signed 
off for people to work on the plan implying Republican interest.  Senator 
Burton's office also reported work on the same Plan B.  Governor Davis' 
office is aware of the plan but has yet to comment.  There is also no word at 
this time as to whether the Republican Senate leadership is in support of 
Nation's Plan B.

Key details of the Nation plan include a $1.2 billion option for the state to 
purchase SoCal's transmission assets.  This money would be given to SoCal by 
the state regardless of whether the option was exercised, a detail likely to 
be unpopular with voters.  The remainder of the undercollect, stated as $3.5 
billion or an amount determined by PUC review, would be paid through 
securitization of the undercollect by SoCal.  Moreover, the utility would 
sell the state additional power at a cost beyond the 10 years already agreed 
upon in the memorandum-of-understanding and additional power from other 
company sources.   Sources report that the Nation plan also currently calls 
for generators to take a 30% haircut. 

The Nation Plan B will likely be introduced as a bill tomorrow and will 
likely go through start the legislative process by early next week.  The next 
scheduled floor session is Thursday; we should be able to tell how fast the 
legislature intends to move the bill.  There is no indication whether SoCal 
Edison would agree to the Nation plan.  Sources believe it is likely that 
SoCal would object to at least some of the plan's provisions (for example, a 
PUC audit of SoCal's debt amount to determine the direct rate component to 
pay for the undercollect).  SoCal is very much at odds with the PUC and 
wishes them to play as little role as possible.  If SoCal does ultimately 
agree to the plan, the state reportedly may offer a similar deal to PG&E.

It looks like Reliant is now using air quality requirements as justification 
for their high prices at their plants in CA.  We are checking to confirm that 
their facilities are in fact reaching their emission ceilings.


Pressure builds on Davis to relax air standards  



Updated: May 24, 2001 - 2:22 p.m.  

A major electricity supplier said Thursday it will sharply cut prices 
for power from three Southern California plants in anticipation that 
air quality monitors will let the plants release more pollution this 
summer.  

Meanwhile, aides said Gov. Gray Davis will consider paying 
businesses to run heavily polluting diesel generators to boost the 
state's power supply and help avert rolling blackouts.  

Reliant Energy said it could chop its power bids from the high of 
$1,900 per megawatt hour Davis criticized this month to as little as 
$150 per megawatt hour -- but only if air regulators quickly allow it 
to exceed pollution standards at the three plants.  

The Houston-based generator will cut its prices immediately, but 
will soon be forced to shut down three of its five Southern California 
plants for the rest of the year if pollution standards aren't lifted, said 
Joe Bob Perkins, president and CEO of Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group.  

Davis singled out Reliant's $1,900-per-megawatt-hour charge earlier 
this month as an example of the egregious prices he said 
generators should voluntarily cut.  

Reliant said it deliberately bid the high price to discourage the 
state's power grid operator from calling its high-polluting plants into 
use. Using the plants now eats up valuable pollution credits that 
will likely be needed to keep the plants running during even higher 
demand periods this summer, the company said.  

"In essence, we are doing exactly what Gov. Gray Davis has 
suggested. But if these restrictions are not lowered, we will run out 
of power from these units very quickly," Perkins said in a 
statement.  

Perkins proposed that emissions hours not be counted against 
Reliant's yearly allotment whenever the plants are called into 
operation to help prevent blackouts.  

Reliant's Mandalay, Etiwanda and Ellwood plants each face annual 
air pollution limits imposed by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District and the Santa Barbara County and Ventura 
County air pollution control districts. Reliant has asked for 
extensions from each of the districts.  

"There's no question we are in an emergency situation. We will 
consider every option available" to avert blackouts, said Davis 
spokesman Roger Salazar. But he said the administration had not 
seen Reliant's proposal.  

Davis also will consider paying businesses to fire up their backup 
generators when necessary to avoid outages, Salazar said. 
Running the generators would let the businesses disconnect from 
the state's power grid, freeing up electricity for other uses.  

The proposals have consumer and environmental groups outraged.  

"It's a short-term fix that will have potential long-term health 
consequences," said Paul Knepprath of the American Lung 
Association of California.  

The state should instead cut demand by encouraging more 
conservation, the lung association and 18 other consumer and 
environmental groups said in a letter to Davis on Wednesday.  

Davis already is promoting conservation, but blackouts have health 
and public safety consequences too, Salazar said. The use of 
backup generators is being proposed by the administration's top 
energy advisers, but Davis has not yet seen the proposal, Salazar 
said.  

The governor is willing to "explore every conceivable option for 
generation this summer," Salazar said.  

The twin developments come the same week the administration cut 
by 20 percent its estimate of new power generation that will be 
available this summer. Davis now projects 4,000 additional 
megawatts, 1,000 megawatts short of his original estimate. A 
megawatt is enough power for about 750 homes.

One comments, as the DWR projections indicate, their price projection of spot 
(non-contracted) is not where the enter into their contracted amounts (notice 
non-contracted stays above contracted).     Thus you do not see an MTM 
reduction over time.

All:

One thing to note is that while the DWR contracts are blended with the core, 
the non-core, if our curve come to be true, would enjoy the back end of the 
curve's lower price path.    

We calculated, based on the DWR's figures, the negative mark-to-maket at the 
various points in time:

6/02      $4.2B
12/02    $5.8B
6/03      $7.0B

While our curves differ, this gives an order of magnitute.

Subject: Concept for core/noncore Analysis

OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch 
some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.  Wanted to lay out 
the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest 
in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is 
the analysis that you're already working on:

Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03.
Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 
years).
Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the 
short for the core)
Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts 
the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's 
going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs 
attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date.

Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

SBX2 39 (Speier) and ABX2 28 (Migden) were pulled from their respective
committee hearings next week.  Both bills are being reviewed by the
Administration.  One item which the Administration is apparently
considering is making the new PPA a quasi-regulatory agency, perhaps
with authority over all in-state generation.  If the Administration
proceeds with this plan, it would probably be incorporated into one or
both of these bills.  In their current forms, SBX2 39 and ABX2 28 would
do the following:

SBX2 39 would dramatically increase the states regulatory authority over
in-state electric generation
facilities.  This measure is being opposed by IEP and several of its
member companies.

ABX2 28 would expand the authority of the EOB to allow EOB to act on any
matters made subject to the approval or determination by EOB, and to
investigate any matter to ensure that the interests of California's
citizens.  IEP and several of its member companies are supporting this
measure.

ABX2 35 (Vargas) was just amended to require the State Public Works
Board to acquire, for a period of at least 18 months but not to exceed
24 months, in the name of and on behalf of the state, pursuant to Part
11 (commencing with Section 15850) of Division 3 of the Government Code,
possession and use of real property necessary for the generation of
power.  The intent of the author is for the state to seize all divested
plants and "rent" them for approximately two years.  The bill will be
heard by the Assembly Judiciary Committee next week.

This is a very good, easily digestible summary of the FERC order.  Alan 
Zaremberg, CEO of the Chamber and located in Sacramento, asked if we had a 
summary that we could provide him.  Zaremberg is convinced that no one in 
California understands what FERC did and wanted to try to educate them.  If 
we sanitize it to remove anything sensitive, are folks comfortable providing 
it to Zaremberg?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Gary, I just sent this to your other e-mail address.  The Lt Gov. was in on
this San Diego employee thing at the Dunn hearings, so this may come up.
The credibility of these former SDG&E employees was very weak in the
hearing and their allegations are absurd.....
________________________________________________________________________

To California news media covering electricity crisis:

As a result of the false claims by three former San Diego Gas & Electric
employees we have been in the news a bit lately. To add a bit of clarity to
the situation I am sending you our release issued Friday that goes through
each of the three claims and our response.

To more fully understand the situation, please read the attached story that
appeared in the LA Times yesterday. These reporters had the logs that were
stolen from our South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista more than two weeks
ago.  We went through these log books line by line with these reporters.
They also obtained confidential information from the Cal-ISO during these
three days (January 16-18) that indicated that we were operating at their
instruction when ramping up an down the units.  This is because the ISO
purchased the ability to move the units up and down to help ensure the
state's supply and demand is in balance.  This is a common practice and
done every hour of every day by the ISO at plants that are able to provide
this service.

Its unfortunate that we were not allowed to respond to these charges when
they were made formally in Senator Dunn's  committee hearing Friday
(although the information was leaked way before the hearing by someone).  I
understand that Governor Gray Davis is meeting with these former SDG&E
employees tomorrow.  We had tried to personally meet with the governor last
summer to offer very inexpensive long term power contracts and 2000
megawatts of peaking plants in 2001 and 2002 and were not able to.

   TIMES STAFF WRITERS


SACRAMENTO -- Three former San Diego power plant workers on Friday accused
officials of Duke Energy Co. of manipulating California's crippled
electricity market for higher profits, but records and interviews show that
the company was responding partly to state instructions.


Their testimony caused a sensation among power industry critics and brought
a sharp response from the company at the center of the whistle-blower
allegations, which called them "baseless."


The former employees at Duke's South Bay facility told a legislative
committee investigating alleged price gouging that the plant was ramped up
and down "like a yo-yo" in an apparent gambit to drive up profits.


In support of the allegations, the workers produced logs showing Duke's
trading arm constantly increasing and decreasing generation during power
emergencies over three days in mid-January.


Duke officials, who will testify in the weeks ahead, said the up and down
throttling of the plant came at the direction of the state, which had paid
the company to hold the disputed generation capacity in reserve.


Public records gathered in recent weeks by The Times confirm that at least
part of that activity was directed by the California Independent System
Operator.


Moreover, Cal-ISO, which in the past has accused power firms of withholding
electricity to boost prices, stressed Friday that it regularly directs
generators to adjust output to keep the grid humming.


"On a daily basis we have reserves that are set aside," Cal-ISO spokesman
Gregg Fishman said. "It's energy that can be called upon instantly to meet
a fluctuation in demand, or within 10 minutes, or within an hour.
Certainly, we call on [standby] services regularly to meet these
fluctuations."


The three witnesses who testified each had worked at the plant for more
than 20 years, first for San Diego Gas & Electric and later, under
contract, for Duke. They were let go by Duke in April.


Former power plant mechanics Ed G. Edwards Jr. and Glenn D. Johnson accused
Duke of throwing away valuable plant parts and of manipulating generation
capacity beginning in 1999, leaving workers puzzled.


Managers brushed aside questions about the activity, saying they were "for
economic" reasons, the workers said.


"Sometimes a unit would be down 'for economics' for two or three days.
Sometimes, it would be down for two or three hours. It didn't make sense,"
Johnson said.


He said the phrase appeared to be "another way to explain limiting the load
or curtailing the load to boost prices."


"Instead of running two units to make the same price," Johnson said, "you
could run one unit and make three times the price." Some energy experts
argue that it is possible to increase earnings by trimming power supply in
California's tight electricity market.


The third worker, Jimmy Olkjer, an assistant control room operator, said
such actions began after Duke began operating the plant.


Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), the committee chairman, asked Olkjer whether
SDG&E operated in the same manner. "No," he said.


Edwards, one of the ex-mechanics, said prolonged repairs by Duke were part
of the apparent gaming of the power market.


Once, he was directed to throw away 23 pallets of power plant parts, he
said. "Some of it was brand new stuff" in its original packaging. "I used a
forklift, took them to a dumpster and dumped the pallets," Edwards said.


He testified that often it took weeks to find a needed spare part, which in
the past would have been readily available.


Duke officials bragged about their money-making ways, Edwards said. At
employee parties after the first year of operation, Duke executives boasted
that "they made more money than they had expected in five years."


Dunn and Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), a committee member, said
later that they were impressed with the credibility of the workers'
testimony, but that it did not constitute a "smoking gun." Both said they
would form no conclusion until hearing from Duke and other generators.


Duke officials, who will testify before the committee next month, said
Cal-ISO controlled much of the ramping activity. "Our employees followed
the directions" of the grid operator, said Bill Hall, who oversees Duke's
plant operations in the West.


Old or unnecessary parts were discarded as part of an upgrading of the
plant's inventory system, said Tom Williams, a Duke spokesman. Duke has
decreased outages and significantly increased its production since
purchasing the plant, he said. "The proof's in the numbers," he said.


One plant mechanic has told The Times that he was told to toss parts by the
previous owner, SDG&E, as well as by Duke.


Cal-ISO officials declined to discuss specific contracts and activities
with Duke. But records show that the agency regularly buys reserve and
standby power at the plant. That electricity can be ordered on and off the
system to maintain balances crucial to the complex grid.


In the January period focused on at Friday's hearing, records show that
three of the four South Bay units were repeatedly called on to deliver
standby power. The fourth unit was shut for servicing.


On Jan. 17, for example, records show that the agency called on one unit to
increase output by 62 megawatts at 6 a.m. and reduce it by that same amount
two hours later. Then at noon, the agency ordered 71 more megawatts,
cutting it back to 20 at 3 p.m. By day's end, the agency had asked for an
additional 38 megawatts.


A second unit was instructed to add 50 or more megawatts four times on the
same day. A third unit was ramped up or down 12 times, bouncing from zero
to as high as 221 megawatts.


The records show only power that ISO actually needed. The agency refused to
disclose how much reserve power it had under contract with Duke that it had
not called on.


But after reviewing records for the mid-January period, Cal-ISO manager of
markets Brian Rahman said, "The most viable reason why any one unit would
not have been producing would have been for operating reserve."

                    DUKE ENERGY REFUTES FALSE CHARGES;
               PLANT OUTPUT WAS CONTROLLED BY CALIFORNIA ISO
June 22, 2001

SACRAMENTO ? Duke Energy today said the output of its South Bay power plant
in California was directed by the California Independent System Operator
(ISO) to track fluctuations in electricity demand, and the plant operated
at top reliability. The company strongly denied allegations by three former
plant employees that power output was reduced at Duke Energy's own
direction.

The workers making the allegations were employees of San Diego Gas &
Electric (SDG&E) who were not hired as part of the new operating team when
Duke Energy assumed full control of the South Bay power plant in April.

Bill Hall, vice president of Duke Energy's western operations, said, "These
allegations represent just one more page in a very long chapter of
misinformation disseminated by people who don't know the full story."

Hall reviewed the charges and the facts:

Charge: Output from South Bay was ramped up and down to manipulate prices
during times when energy supplies were short.
The facts:
?    The units were operated under the direction of the California ISO to
meet system reliability       and Duke Energy's contractual commitments.
?    While the three ex-workers allude to log books from the plant control
room with notations      from Duke Energy Trading & Marketing (DETM), the
former SDG&E South Bay employees         apparently did not know that that
the ISO directs output through the DETM coordinator. Our     records of ISO
directions match up perfectly with the logbook notations.

Charge: The most expensive unit was run at South Bay to drive up ISO
prices.
The facts:
?    South Bay's 15-megawatt, jet-fueled unit was designed principally to
provide start-up power   to the station's steam units. This unit has been
made available to provide as much energy as   possible to California during
the state's energy crisis.
?    During the period in question, the jet-fueled unit was being operated
because the price of jet      fuel was substantially less than the cost of
natural gas. This resulted in lower marginal costs. ?   The 15-megawatt
unit was being run to provide electricity to cover Duke Energy's California
     contractual commitments. This electricity was not being bid into the
ISO market, so there     was no way it could have influenced ISO market
prices.

Charge: Inventory management (including "throwing out spare parts") at
South Bay resulted in increased outage time to accomplish repairs.
The facts:
?    At no time did lack of inventory result in a unit being unavailable
for service.
?    The inventory management practices at South Bay represent standard
industry practices.      Duke Energy purchased the entire inventory for
South Bay when we assumed operations for      the plant in 1998. We
retained the parts and tools we deemed useful and disposed of
inventory that was damaged or obsolete.
?    Duke Energy employees have taken extraordinary actions to keep our
power plants operating   during California's energy crisis.

Duke Energy continues to deliver real solutions to the state's energy needs
and to operate its business with integrity.

Duke Energy will hold a media briefing immediately following the state
Senate hearing at approximately 4 p.m. (ET). Reporters not in Sacramento
can call-in at: 888/664-9965, passcode DUKE.

Bustamonte                                       





This Thursday I will be a guest along with our favorite Lt Gov on
California Capital Week.  I can't think of a worse time to have this,
since Bustamonte is the point man on fhe three witnesses that
participated in last Friday's public Senate Hearing on price
manipulation.  So feed me your advice.  I am trying to take the high
road, but I will warn you right now that if Bustamonte makes any of his
outrageous statements in front of me, I will boldly correct him in no
short order.

		 Subject: Sacramento Bee--Dan Weintraub column: Consumer rep envisions ulti 
mate confrontation


> Team,
> This is the best synopsis we've seen of Harvey Rosenfield's motivations
> for putting a referendum on the ballot.
> **********************************
> Daniel Weintraub: Consumer rep envisions ultimate confrontation
> Sacramento Bee
> May 15, 2001
> 
> Now that Gov. Gray Davis has rallied his fellow Democrats, run over the
> Republican opposition in the Legislature and set the state on a course to
> borrow $13 billion to pay for a few months of electricity purchases,
> there's probably only one person who can stop him: Harvey Rosenfield. 
> Rosenfield is the Santa Monica-based consumer advocate who tried to halt
> California's experiment in electricity deregulation before it got started.
> His 1998 ballot measure failed, and that campaign is blamed in some
> circles for delaying construction of new power plants just long enough to
> cause the electricity shortage that's helped send prices heavenward. 
> But if Rosenfield's last ballot initiative got the state's energy
> establishment in a snit, the one he's contemplating now would positively
> push them over the edge. He is seriously considering launching a signature
> drive to force a referendum on the legislation Davis just signed to
> authorize his $13 billion energy bond measure. 
> That bond, to be repaid by ratepayers, is supposed to reimburse the
> state's general fund for the cost of electricity the state has been buying
> for consumers since January, when Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern
> California Edison ran out of money. The bond measure also will be used to
> delay the pain of the extremely high prices expected this summer. Without
> it, consumers would immediately face another staggering rate increase,
> probably well into triple digits. 
> The alternative would be a state budget in shambles. All the tax money
> Davis has spent on electricity this year already was earmarked for
> traditional services such as education, roads and health care. A
> referendum that killed the bond measure would leave a gaping hole in the
> budget that could only be filled by a huge tax increase or unprecedented
> spending cuts. 
> Rosenfield is something of a publicity hound, and his talk of a referendum
> may be just that. Collecting 750,000 signatures in less than 90 days,
> which is what's required to qualify the referendum, would be a massive
> undertaking. Even Rosenfield concedes that the chances are no better than
> 50-50 that he will proceed. But this is a man who has qualified two
> measures for the ballot already, including one in 1988 that brought on
> regulation of the California insurance industry. You have to take him
> seriously. 
> The question is why he would even consider it. Why would a man who fancies
> himself a friend of the ratepayer ponder a move that would force consumers
> to swallow a massive rate hike, or else bankrupt the state? Because
> Rosenfield's goal is to see the destruction of the entire private power
> system that's now serving California -- and raking in enormous profits for
> its owners. 
> And if it were up to him, he'd be willing to risk economic catastrophe to
> make it happen. His theory is that the power generators will simply keep
> raising their prices as long as the governor keeps putting more money on
> the table. It is, he says, like giving crack to an addict. Take that money
> away, and the generators will kick the habit, fast. 
> "If bleeding dry the general fund is foreclosed, and politically or as a
> matter of economics you can't raise rates that high in the state, the only
> thing the governor can do is turn to the generators and say, 'I'm taking
> your plants.' At which point they will say, 'OK, all right, we're lowering
> our prices,' or some face-saving thing will happen. The ultimate showdown
> between naked capitalism and populist outrage occurs." And he's convinced
> that capitalism will blink. 
> "If the lights go off in California, and the economy goes down the tubes,
> then 20 years of Republican ideology, of less government, free markets,
> competition -- all of that goes down the tubes. 
> "All you have to do is look at history to see that when there have been
> economic cataclysms that have decimated the economy, people want action
> and they'll do anything, whether its seizing private property, or
> whatever. There will be a revolution, and I don't think the political
> institutions in this country are prepared to push things to that point." 
> The Legislature already has set a Nov. 15 deadline after which the state
> budget is supposed to be off-limits to Davis' power-buying ways. But
> that's not good enough for Rosenfield. By then, he thinks, Davis will have
> burned through the entire proceeds of the first bond measure and the total
> tab will be approaching $20 billion. Rates will have to rise again to pay
> that bill. 
> Rosenfield is prescribing an economic amputation -- without anesthesia --
> to stop a painful and dangerous infection. But he is not the only one
> thinking about the doomsday scenario. 
> The power generators themselves have lately been lining up to try to cut
> deals with the state. They have offered to take caps on their profits,
> forgive some of the debt that's owed them, anything to keep the system
> running without further provoking the public's ire. They know that
> Rosenfield's kind of anger can be contagious. They want to contain it
> before it spreads.

Subject: where does our energy come from?


Assemblyman Bill Leonard's most recent e-newsletter contained the
following information.  I think it is very interesting to consider in
light of the present energy situation in California and the comments of
our present Governor.

Regards,
Curt

---------------------------------------------


***Who Really Powers California?***
Governor Davis has made no secret that he believes that swashbuckling,
cattle rustling, energy barons from Texas are to blame for our energy
crisis.  While Texas power companies make for good bad guys in the
Governor's transparent Kabuki theater of blame, Leonard Letter readers
may
be interested to see who really provides power to Californians.  The
following list illustrates what percentage of our power supply each
group of
generators provides. (Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded
up
resulting in slightly more than 100%)

18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California)
15%- Southern California Edison (California)
11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada)
10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California)
10%- Imported power from the Southwest
7%- State and Federal Agencies
6%- AES power company
5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts
5%- Reliant power company
4%- Duke power company
4%- Southern power company
4%- Dynegy power company
1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California)
1%- Calpine power company
1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)

It should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from
Texas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's
energy
portfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's
AES,
and North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy
portfolio.

This list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every
provider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to
identify those power producers who used market power to ring up high
profits
on Californians, we should include ALL power producers in our
investigations.  State and federal agencies, independent power
companies,
utilities, municipal utilities, and even local irrigation districts
could
all be guilty of gouging consumers.  Davis's focusing on only those
companies from Texas does everyone in this state a disservice and is a
misrepresentation of fact.

Signs of Abuse Seen by Judge in Gas Case


By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

Internal documents submitted as evidence that the El Paso
Corporation artificially inflated natural gas prices in California
suggest that the company did indeed intend to manipulate prices.

The following key Second Extraordinary Session Assembly bills were just
introduced.  Additional bills were introduced to deal primarily with
items such as outage schedules and notification protocols as well as
consumer tax credits.

ABX2 1 (Cardoza) - This bill would permit irrigation districts to
purchase gas from public agencies and permit irrigation districts to
explore for gas.  This is identical to ABX1 39.

ABX2 2 (Corbett) - This would establish as windfall profits tax.  This
is identical to ABX1 128.

ABX2 7 (Simitian) - This would establish a formula for standby charges
for QFs.  This is identical to ABX1 108.

ABX2 9 (Migden) - This would permit local governments to aggregate
provided that IOUs provide metering and billing services.  This is
identical to ABX1 48.

ABX2 10 (Hertzberg) - This would require, as a condition of receiving a
permit from the CEC, that a generator enter into a contract with DWR or
a municipal utility.  This is identical to ABX1 60.

ABX2 11 (Wright) - This would permit governmental entities currently
served by SCE and LADWP to be served only by LADWP.  This is identical
to ABX1 54.

ABX2 14 (Canciamilla) - This bill would permit entities to sell gas
in-state without being classified as a public utility and would allow
for the sale of low grade gas.  This is identical to ABX1 73.

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR 
PR01: 285
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/10/2001 



GOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE 

Order Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans 

LOS ANGELES 

Governor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes 
the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary, 
emergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large 
businesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power 
emergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating 
customers. 

"Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial," Governor 
Davis said. "Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even 
avoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources 
to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they 
voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods."

The Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent 
load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent 
System Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned 
Utilities. 

The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer 
2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be 
determined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the 
amount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated 
to be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of 
customers who sign up.

Economics 90210

Peter Foster
National Post
Dumb ol' Dubya. President Bush and his administration have been taken to task 
this week by U.S. liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so 
naive as to suggest that California's problems won't be solved by price 
controls. That, sniffed last Sunday's New York Times, was just "Econ 101." 
What the President needed was a lesson in Econ 90210, presented by the 
Department of Sarah Polley-Sci.
The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in 
the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely, and with 
them more blackouts. Meanwhile, the real causes of the California crisis -- a 
screwed-up deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to 
new state power plants -- are buried beneath screams about gouging and 
profiteering, and calls for an anti-corporate witch hunt.
The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a "gang 
of ten" economists including Alfred Kahn, "the architect of airline 
deregulation under President Carter." But price caps don't work. As President 
Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week, "[P]rice 
caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply." 
However, according to another liberal economist, Princeton's Paul Krugman, we 
shouldn't worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway, 
and in the longer term, new supplies are on the way via new plants, whose 
arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls.
Apart from being terrible economics, Mr. Krugman's attitude is even more 
objectionable politics. At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his 
support for price caps. They are intended to keep money out of the hands of 
power suppliers. Meanwhile, he pursues the conceit -- disproven time and time 
again -- that prices can be fine-tuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be 
"just enough" to call forth the right amount of new power. "Nobody," he 
writes, "has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power 
producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce 
the power supply?"
Mr. Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ 101 learn 
that "strictly speaking, the standard argument against price controls applies 
only to competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need 
not cause a shortage; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually 
lead to higher output." This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up 
his hands and says "No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you 
clever wonks have capped them, so just come in and take what you want. And 
which way is it to the airport?"
Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that "That's not an 
argument you want to use too often." In fact, the argument is dangerous 
nonsense. There is no "monopoly" supplier of energy to California (although 
many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the 
"commanding heights" of electricity generation, . la Lenin). Moreover, both 
the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as 
ever. Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller. To hold down prices 
means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have 
to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats -- as it 
was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that 
brought the United States to crisis back in 1977. Meanwhile, the impact of 
such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing 
of market signals. They damage the entire investment climate by raising the 
spectre of further whimsical intervention, and by establishing an effective 
ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses, except 
for those with political pull. Professor Krugman asserts that "generating 
capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut." 
If that happens, we may be sure that Mr. Krugman will not be calling for 
price supports.
Mr. Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that 
California's problems are all due to market "manipulation" by big energy 
suppliers. He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide 
assertion that President Bush's "knee-jerk ideologue" advisers may be "so 
close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that 
whatever is good for Enron is good for America." The presence in California 
of Enron, the world's largest energy trader, has increased supplies to the 
state, but according to California's attorney general, democrat Bill Lockyer, 
Enron's head, Kenneth Lay, should be sent to jail. After all, he did raise 
campaign funds for George Bush. And price caps and jail for business 
executives somehow go together nicely.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: May 1, 2001

RE: FERC's April 26th Order Establishing Prospective
Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for California Wholesale
Electric Markets

On April 26th, FERC issued an Order Establishing Prospective Mitigation and 
Monitoring Plan for the California Wholesale Electric Markets.  EPSA has 
previously forwarded FERC's press release outlining the major features of the 
Order, along with a brief e-mail explaining one confusing aspect of the 
Order.  This memo provides a more in-depth analysis of the Order.  In 
addition, we need to consider whether EPSA should seek rehearing or 
clarification of any aspect of this Order.  Filings would be due at FERC no 
later than Tuesday, May 29th.  Based on a review of the order, there are 
issues on which EPSA might seek rehearing, which are outlined below.  We will 
discuss these issues on an upcoming weekly conference call.  If you have 
additional issues you want EPSA to raise, please forward them to Julie Simon 
at 202-628-8200 or at jsimon@epsa.org.

APRIL 26th ORDER

In this Order, the Commission puts into place a market monitoring and 
mitigation plan for real-time energy markets in California that is intended 
to replace the $150/MWh "breakpoint" plan adopted in the December 15th 
Order.  The mitigation plan will go into effect May 29th, with the current 
$150/MWh breakpoint and refund approach continued for an additional month.  
Except for the demand-side bidding program, the plan will terminate not later 
than one year from the date of the Order.  However, the monitoring and 
mitigation requirements are contingent on the three California utilities and 
the CAISO making an RTO filing, consistent with the requirements of Order No. 
2000, by June 1, 2001.

The Order also initiates a Section 206 investigation into the rates, terms 
and conditions of public utility sales for resale of electric energy in the 
WSCC, other than through the CAISO markets, for all sales in "real-time spot 
markets" (defined as up to 24 hours in advance) and when contingency reserves 
for any control area fall below 7 percent.

The Commission states that its goal was to address the need for mitigation 
"in as market-oriented a manner as possible," so as not to discourage needed 
infrastructure investment, while allowing price signals to create demand 
response.

The Order includes the following requirements:

1. Coordination and Control of Outages

To ensure adequate capacity, the Order stresses the need for the CAISO and 
generators to work cooperatively to schedule unit maintenance and outages.  
The Commission stresses that the CAISO's requirements for outage coordination 
need to "foster cooperation, rather than establish punitive provisions either 
penalizing generators or the ISO."   The Order requires the CAISO to make a 
tariff filing within 15 days proposing a mechanism for the coordination and 
control of outages, including periodic reports to the Commission.  Comments 
on the tariff filing will be due within 5 days.

2. Selling Obligations

In creating a must-offer obligation, the Commission's goal is to ensure that 
all generating units that are able to run, but are not scheduled in 
real-time, will in fact be made available to the CAISO in the real-time 
markets.  Therefore, the Order requires that:

all generators with Participating Generator Agreements (PGAs),
all sellers selling into the CAISO markets that own generation in California,
and
all sellers using the CAISO tariffs that own generation in California

offer the CAISO all of their capacity in real-time during all hours it is 
available and not already scheduled to run through bilateral agreements.  The 
scope of this requirement includes non-jurisdictional, non-public utility 
generators.  Stressing that "all generators need to participate in helping to 
solve the problems in California," the Commission concludes that a generator 
that has capacity available in real-time would, under competitive conditions, 
be willing to sell that energy "at a price that covers its marginal costs."  
All generators are also subject to the price mitigation plan as well, 
including the required filing of heat rate and emission data described below.

The Commission also clarifies certain issues.  First, no generator will be 
required to run in violation of its certificate or applicable law.  However, 
the Commission finds that environmental limitations are state-imposed and the 
question of whether units can run outside proscribed environmental limits and 
at what cost are within the control of the state.  Generators will be 
permitted to recover environmental mitigation costs, presumably by justifying 
a bid above the proxy price.  Second, because of its unique characteristics, 
hydroelectric power is exempt from this requirement.

Finally, the Commission rejects the concerns of generators that they need to 
withhold capacity to cover the risk of a generating unit tripping off line.  
In that circumstance, the generator will pay no more than the real-time 
market clearing price to replace that energy, which is what it is being paid 
to make the energy available to the CAISO.  Thus, it should be indifferent to 
selling all available capacity into the CAISO real-time market.

3. Demand Response

Each public utility purchasing power in the CAISO's real-time market will be 
required, by June 1, to submit demand-side bids indicating the price at which 
load will be curtailed and identify that load.  The bids are to include the 
maximum price that the purchaser is willing to pay for specific amounts of 
energy and the loads on its system that will be curtailed when the real-time 
energy price exceeds that bid.  This is the only aspect of the Commission's 
plan that will not expire within one year.

4. Price Mitigation in the Real-time Auction During Reserve
Deficiencies

During all periods when Stage 1, 2 or 3 emergencies are in effect (i.e., when 
reserves fall below 7.5 percent), certain price mitigation procedures will 
apply to the market clearing auction for the real-time market.  The following 
explains those as we understand them.  The language in the order is quite 
confusing and may be open to more than one interpretation.

First, all gas-fired generators are required to submit to the Commission and 
the CAISO, on a confidential basis, the heat rate and emission rate for each 
generator.  Second, each day by 8:00 a.m., the CAISO will publish a daily gas 
price, using an average of the daily prices published in the prior day's Gas 
Daily for all California delivery points.  The CAISO will also publish an 
emission cost using data from Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage 
Services, also for the prior day.  In establishing the market clearing price 
for its real-time market, the CAISO will calculate the fuel and emission 
costs for the marginal unit, using the previously supplied confidential data 
and the published gas and emission costs, plus a $2.00 add-on for operating 
and maintenance expenses.  That calculated cost or proxy price for the 
marginal unit will be used to set the market clearing price for that hour.

Any generator that submits a bid higher than the proxy price calculated by 
the CAISO will be paid what it bids, subject to refund and justification, but 
that bid will not set the market clearing price.  Any generator that submits 
a bid lower than the proxy price will receive the market clearing price and 
not be subject to any refund liability.  Justification of higher prices must 
be submitted to the Commission within 7 days of the end of the month and must 
include a detailed breakdown of all of the component costs.  Opportunity 
costs may not be included because of the Commission's belief that no 
opportunity costs exist in real-time markets.

Bids from resources outside California can elect the market-clearing price or 
submit their own bids.  Those bids will not be used to set the 
market-clearing price.  In addition, marketers can elect the market-clearing 
price or submit their own bids.  Bids above the market-clearing price must be 
justified based on the prices paid for power.

5. Conditions on Market-based Rate Authority

The Order raises new concerns about certain bidding practices that may 
suggest anticompetitive behavior.  The Commission specifically identifies two 
types of prohibited bidding practices that will be subject to increased 
scrutiny, refunds and/or suspension of market based rate authority.  The 
first prohibited bidding practice occurs when bids vary with unit output in a 
manner that is unrelated to the known performance characteristics of the 
unit.  Known as "hockey stick" bids, this involves bids where the last 
megawatts are bid at excessively high prices relative to the other capacity 
from the unit.  The other identified prohibited practice involves bids that 
vary over time in a manner that appears unrelated to changes in the unit's 
performance or changes in the supply environment that would induce additional 
risk.  This type of bidding increases prices only in response to increased 
demand or reduced reserve margins, and it timed to public announcements of 
system conditions or outages in the bidder's portfolio.

6. Monitoring

The CAISO will be required to provide the Commission with weekly reports of 
CAISO schedule, outage and bid data.  The CAISO is to identify any concerns 
it has about bidding practices in those weekly reports.  The Commission is 
maintaining the current six month time period for keeping bid information 
confidential.

On September 14th, and quarterly thereafter, the CAISO is required to file a 
report with the Commission analyzing how the mitigation plan is operating, as 
well as the progress made in developing new generation and demand side 
response.  Comments on the CAISO reports will be due within 15 days.

7. CAISO Market Stabilization Plan

The Commission offered little comment on the CAISO's market stabilization 
plan, but does note that the proposals for day-ahead and hour-ahead energy 
markets go beyond the scope of this proceeding and should be filed under 
Section 205 so that all parties can review the proposals.  The CAISO is 
specifically directed not to go forward with any plans, such as the purchase 
of computer equipment or software, until the Commission has reviewed and 
accepted the filing.  In an unrelated section, the Commission notes that it 
will "address allegations about the ISO's lack of independence and its 
governance procedures in a later order."

8. Escrow for Past Unpaid Bills

The Commission invites comments, within 30 days, on whether the CAISO should 
be required to institute, on a prospective basis, a surcharge on power sales 
that would be maintained in an escrow account to cover the three IOUs' unpaid 
bills to generators.   The Commission specifically seeks comments on whether 
increased production would be tied to an increased likelihood that generators 
will be paid.

9. West-Wide 206 Investigation

As noted above, the Commission is instituting an investigation into the 
rates, terms and conditions of public utility sales of electric energy in the 
WSCC other than through the CAISO markets.  The investigation is limited to 
energy sold in what the Commission terms real-time spot markets, which is 
defined as 24 hours in advance, and under conditions when contingency 
reserves, as defined by the WSCC, for any control area fall below 7 percent.

The Commission also invites comments on whether the must-offer and price 
mitigation rules contained in this Order for California should be applied to 
the WSCC.  Comments are due May 10th and EPSA is preparing draft comments for 
members to review shortly.

POSSIBLE AREAS FOR REHEARING AND/OR CLARIFICATION

There are several areas where EPSA may want to seek rehearing and/or 
clarification of the Commission's Order.

Given the current make-up of the CAISO Board, we have grave concerns about 
releasing confidential heat rate and emission data to the CAISO.  Since the 
Board is clearly working at the behest of the Governor, that commercially 
sensitive data could easily end up with DWR, which is actively negotiating 
contracts to purchase power from these units.  In addition, we have concerns 
about the CAISO's ability to protect this data since similarly confidential 
information from the CAISO's market monitoring unit has appeared in the Los 
Angeles Times.  The Commission should ensure that only an independent entity, 
not the CAISO, have access to this data.

The actual operation of the price mitigation is confusing and amenable to 
several interpretations.  The Commission should clarify, possibly with 
examples, how the market-clearing price will be calculated and the effect of 
the market-clearing price on a variety of bids.

The discussion of second category of prohibited bids is unclear.  The 
Commission appears to be saying that bids that value scarcity are prohibited, 
but this makes little economic or practical sense.

Do we agree with the Commission's conclusion that a generator is indifferent 
(in real-time) to receiving the market clearing price for its as-available 
energy, when it may need to energy to self-supply reserves if a unit trips 
off?  Are there operational concerns that make this economic trade-off 
unworkable?  We will need to educate the Commission if we want to raise this 
issue.

I spoke again briefly with Hertzberg last night and had a lengthy discussion 
late last night with the guy from CSFB who's been providing Hertzberg with 
pro bono financial advice on the crisis.  Hertzberg is still hot on putting 
all of the utility past due on the noncore, though his consultant and I 
agreed that, politically, the number is more likely to end up somewhere south 
of 100% (if this thing gets legs).  Hertzberg asked for, and we provided 
today, a "fifth scenario," which shows how the numbers work out if 100% of 
core's share of utility past due is shifted to noncore.  It's attached.  Will 
report back with any further developments.

Note: Please discard the file that I sent you yesterday and replace it with 
this one.  That file accidentally had the same cents/kwh, noncore rate for 
both Edison and PG&E.  Edison's rate should be 12.98 cents/kwh NOT 12.21 
cents/kwh. It's the line that reads "Total cost to Noncore under CPUC's 
Recent Decision."

Best,
Jeff

RE:  Gray Davis Radio Ads & The Whole Truth about New Power
Plants
DATE:  July 9, 2001

GRAY DAVIS' NEW RADIO ADS CONTINUE CAMPAIGN OF LIES AND HALF-TRUTHS
DAVIS CLAIMS CREDIT FOR POWER PLANTS LAUNCHED BEFORE HE EVEN TOOK OFFICE

The launching of statewide radio ads by the Gray Davis campaign, a full 16
months ahead of Election Day, should not come to anyone's surprise.  Nor
should anyone be surprised that the new radio ads are full of the typical
Davis lies and half-truths.

Davis has made raising money for his re-election campaign the #1 goal of his
administration, and obviously that money will be spent to twist Davis'
failed record for those who don't know better. The real news in these ads is
the brazen half-truths that permeate these so-called "energy updates."

The ads are billed as almost public service announcements, but in a real
public service, we here at Russo Marsh + Rogers have to set the record
straight with the entire story:

"Of the 16 new power plants Gray Davis seems to be claiming credit for
almost personally developing and constructing, he actually deserves credit
for none!"

Here are the facts:  Of the 16 plants Davis takes credit for, every single
one was first planned for construction and siting before Davis even became
governor.

Ten actually began the licensing process or applied for state certification
before Davis' term in office began.

And the final 6 plants?  Building a power plant is a major undertaking.
Feasibility studies by the plant builder begin months before the first piece
of paper arrives at the Energy Commission.  If you assume that the builder
of a plant first started internal studies only twelve months before their
first license application, then guess what?  They were started under the
previous administration too!

Furthermore, Gray Davis did not appoint his third member of the 5-member
California Energy Commission until February 2001!  And even that third
appointee was a reappointment of Bill Keese, who was originally appointed by
you guessed it, Pete Wilson, "father of deregulation and all things evil in
California."

The truth is that while Gray Davis is boasting of personally licensing these
16 new plants - the heavy load was carried by the previous administration.
Davis is desperately trying to spin his way out of an energy disaster
created when he fiddled away precious time last year, denied utilities the
right to long-term contracting and falsely insisted he was on top of the
energy "challenge."

The Gray Davis spin machine now takes on a new phase with his $30 million
campaign war chest to rewrite history.   It's no news at all that his
desperate first campaign ads are filled with the same half-truths he's been
repeating since day one.

Fortunately, the RM+R Insider will be here for you, every time, to serve as
the "Truth Squad" against Gray's distortions.

California Update: Duke Energy Proposes Settlement Deal 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE][IMAGE]Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) approached Calif. Gov. Gray Davis with 
a secret deal, now made public, that offered monetary concessions if the 
state drops lawsuits and investigations into the company's alleged price 
gouging. Duke made the offer in a secret 17-page letter sent in April to Gov. 
Davis' office, which the governor confirmed on May 2. Davis' spokesman called 
the letter Duke's "wish list," which included having the state call off 
investigations of the North Carolina-based generator. Although Gov. Davis has 
acknowledged receipt of the proposal, he has not officially accepted or 
rejected the offer. 

Analysis: Duke's desire to make a settlement with the state of California 
stems from an ongoing investigation by FERC that began back in March. At that 
time, FERC put 13 California power sellers, including Duke, on notice that 
they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further 
justification for their prices. Duke is considered to be one of four 
companies (along with Dynegy, Reliant and Williams) that faces the biggest 
potential refunds to the state of California. In fact, Duke reportedly faces 
potential refunds of up to $20 million for the power that it has sold to 
California since the start of this year. 

We can fast forward from FERC's investigation to Duke's "good faith" 
settlement offer that now sits before Gov. Gray Davis. The plan sets out 
specific action steps for new generation, conservation programs, electric and 
gas infrastructure improvements, regional transmission frameworks, and 
environmental goals. In addition, Duke has offered an undisclosed settlement 
agreement, for which the California government would agree to cease all 
ongoing investigations of price manipulation by the company. Duke's 
"appropriate payment" is based on fair estimate of the company's alleged 
overcharges for power that it sold to the state.  

Yet, beyond the spin control surrounding this offer, Duke's proposal amounts 
to a mutual back-scratching agreement, with Duke clearly obtaining the 
largest benefit. Duke wants the state to drop all pending lawsuits that 
allege price gouging and tone down the negative public comments against Duke 
made by the governor and others. In return, Duke will refund to the state 
some of the money that it allegedly owes and will further assist in helping 
the state with its power supply needs. However, under the offer Duke will 
admit no wrongdoing. Rather, the company's proposal is being presented as an 
altruistic effort to assist in the resolution of California's flawed market. 
Neither Duke nor Gov. Davis has disclosed the monetary amount of Duke's 
settlement offer, but it is fairly safe to assume that it is only a fraction 
of the $20 million that the state wants. 

Other specifics within Duke's proposal that are important to note include the 
company's "commitment to work with the state to get 680 MW of additional 
peaking capacity ready for summer 2002." In addition, Duke has offered to 
enter into long-term contracts with the state on "reasonable terms" and also 
"attempt to secure other reasonably priced electricity for the state." 
Perhaps eliciting the greatest response within the industry is Duke's pledge 
to "share the financial pain" of California's troubled market with other 
market participants. 

Presently, Duke supplies about 5 percent of California's power needs, the 
majority of which is based on long-term contracts. This is a significant 
point because Duke has argued that its participation in the California market 
is not as entrenched in the volatile spot market, in contrast to many of the 
other power suppliers under FERC's investigation. The company also owns the 
Moss Landing plant, located south of San Jose, Calif., which it is upgrading 
with a $500 million investment. Duke has established that the plant should be 
able to provide approximately 30 percent of California's new generation in 
2002.  

While Duke downplays the role that California has played in its profits, the 
company's total wholesale profits soared 374 percent to $744 million for 
year-end 2000. For the year, Duke's California power plants generated 70 
percent more electricity than they did in 1999. In addition, in 2000 the 
plants provided 17 million megawatt hours of electricity to the state's power 
grid versus 9.5 million the previous year. 

Further, in January and February 2001, Duke charged more for power through 
"credit premiums," which were levied because of the risk of non-payment 
associated with California's financially struggling utilities. Duke claims 
that it is still owed about $100 million by the Department of Water 
Resources, California's power purchaser. 

Duke is not the only company forging settlement contracts with California. On 
May 2, Tulsa-based Williams Co. (also one of the top four companies 
reportedly owing the most to California) announced that it has agreed to pay 
$8 million to the California ISO to end FERC's investigation into whether the 
company's plants were kept offline to drive up prices. For several months, 
FERC has been investigating Williams regarding the company's alleged shutdown 
of two power generation units owned by AES, which reportedly allowed Williams 
to sell power from other units at higher prices. The stipulation and consent 
agreement reached between Williams and FERC identified no improprieties. In 
other words, Williams has made the payment but has admitted to no wrongdoing 
or price manipulation. A Williams spokesperson has said that the $8 million 
will be deducted from the $252 million that Williams is still owed for power 
sales to the California ISO and the California PX.  

Much like Duke, Williams has reported stellar profits over the last year. For 
year-end 2000, the company reported unaudited income from continuing 
operations of $873.2 million, or $1.95 per share on a diluted basis, versus 
$178 million, or 40 cents per share on a restated basis, for 1999. In 
addition, the company reported 1Q 2001 unaudited results that were more than 
double that of 1Q 2000-$378 million, or 78 cents per share, compared with a 
restated $139 million, or 31 cents per share.  

Moreover, the offers that Williams and Duke are forging with the state of 
California are probably only a small portion of what both companies have made 
from power sales to the state. However, one benefit of the deals is that they 
would keep the parties out of years of expensive litigation. Yet, at least as 
of this writing, Gov. Davis remains less than enthused about Duke's offer and 
has not eased off from his accusation that Duke (along with the other power 
generators) has "bilked millions of dollars from California consumers." In 
fact, although the governor has said that he is willing to continue 
negotiations with the various power generators, he has also vowed "not to 
call off the dogs" in the state and federal investigation of any price 
gouging. Toward that end, the state's lieutenant governor has initiated a 
class-action suit on behalf of California consumers against Duke and other 
power generators accused of price fixing. This legal claim follows similar 
suits initiated by the city of San Francisco and lawyers in San Diego. All of 
the suits basically claim the same thing, that Duke and four other power 
generators engaged in unlawful trading practices-such as shutting down 
plants-to drive up market prices in California.  

Duke, of course, maintains its innocence and says that the new lawsuit merely 
makes the same old claim that the company has repeatedly denied. 
Nevertheless, Duke has made a monetary offer to the state of California, 
which could be driven merely by the desire to avoid lengthy legal proceedings 
or by a concern that some wrongdoing on the company's part could eventually 
be determined. The stakes have also been raised with some California 
attorneys suggesting that any generators found to have engaged in price 
gouging should face civil and criminal penalties, which could include 
incarceration for any executive at the company who knowingly allowed the 
price manipulation to take place. Consequently, despite Duke's offer and any 
other proposals that subsequently come from power generators, it appears that 
litigation over the price gouging matter is unavoidable.

Ken Lay spoke with several California CEOs this morning and urged them to get 
personally involved in pushing for a comprehensive set of reforms.  Three 
expressed willingness to help.

Scott McNealy (Sun):  contact person - Piper Cole (piper.cole@sun.com); 
scott.mcnealy@engeng.sun.com.  Mcnealy wants, by close of business today, a 
"cheat sheet" of the talking points to use with politicians (the "8 or 10 
elements of the solution") with the expected comeback he may hear from the 
political leaders and our response to that comeback.  He says he hasn't spent 
time working on issues in Sacremento so we may also want to include a list of 
suggested contacts.
Kevin Sharer (Amgen): contact person - Sarah Jensen, VP of Engineering and 
Operations (805.447.6785); ksharer@amgen.com.  Sharer wants the same 
information as McNealy and he and McNealy both indicated their willingness to 
call a meeting of other California CEOs.  Sharer will also be having 
breakfast with Hertzberg one week from today.
Robert Day (Trust Co of the West):  said that he is very close to the mayor 
of Los Angeles.  He urged Ken to call the mayor (mentioning Day).  Ken would 
like some talking points for that call.

Jeff - please put these items together.

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Please take careful note of the attached, regardless of this, I want all contracts get rid of any "put" obligations to incorporate new facilities !!

Lamar/Kevin, who is now on point commercially for the PacBell (SBC) contract ?

Jeff, I prusume yoo meant 9/20/01 in your 7th bullet point below, not 10/20/01 ?

??????? In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."

??????? The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.

??????? Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.

??????? In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.

??????? Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  

??????? Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.

??????? The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.

??????? If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,

Jeff

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

SBX 27 (Bowen), regarding direct access, failed passage on the Senate floor
on a vote of 23-11 (the bill has an urgency clause and requires 27 votes).
Senator Peace was the only Democrat to vote against the bill.  Senator Peace
spoke against the bill for five minutes during which time he, in a very
emotional state, blamed Enron for the energy crisis, claimed Enron's version
of direct access means only small customers pay for lines and other similar
charges, is trying to ruin the Japanese energy market, is running the
proceedings in Washington where it has already admitted its guilt, and is
looking for another opportunity to steal from California consumers.  Two
Republicans spoke against the bill but their comments more or less focused
on DWR's contracts.  One Republican tried to insert a hostile amendment in
the bill to establish a version of the windfall profits tax on municipal
utilities.  The amendment failed passage on a party-line vote with the
exception of a vote in support from Senator Peace.

In her close, Senator Bowen indicated that the viability of direct access
would be tied to amount of power purchased by DWR.  She characterized DWR's
contracts as outrageous, but expected, given that they were purchased in
duress out of sheer necessity.  Senator Bowen did request reconsideration of
the measure.

Rick, Jeff, Tim:

Here's the latest mark-to-market analysis of the DWR contracts.  It has been updated for recent curves but does not yet include some of the more recently singed contracts, including Pacificorp's Klamath Falls.  (We're still working on adding those contracts.) Mo Elafandi in our structuring group prepared the analysis and you contact either him or I with any questions.

Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea 
(lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them 
regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:

They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power 
purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut.
McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore ("why should it be mandatory to 
go the market?"), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for 
core/noncore has a lot of merit.
Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when 
the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore) 
should pay for DWR's "past" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core 
customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates 
the core's "net short" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would 
not have to pay for any of DWR's "going forward costs" (since core gets them, 
in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation)
I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects 
would be and would share it with them when we're done.
While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful 
to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the 
necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment 
until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do.
They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are 
extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge 
and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the 
Legislature.
Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento 
for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to 
CMA.
Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to 
commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.

Republican Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B proposal:
? Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however, is 
that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component, and 
too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds.)
? The Republicans will "suggest" that generators take a 30% haircut.  "We 
think this is doable."
? The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
? Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would 
establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by 
the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants.
? Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying to 
work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they feel 
"frozen out."  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward having an 
option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the Republicans oppose.

Democratic Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:
? The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's 
MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly 
has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still 
being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.  
Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is 
reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this 
may be unnecessary.
? The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:
- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a 
dedicated rate  component.
- The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of 
their  claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated 
through a  dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to 
strike a deal  for PG&E.
? Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in 
cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:
- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell 
of pieces of  the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a 
lifetime stipulation on  how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little as 
$5 billion if  it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the 
bankrutpcy judge to quell  the protests against such a plan that would very 
likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly  believe that the Judge Montali would 
support this idea.

It's going to be extremely difficult for anyone who has consumed electricity 
to avoid paying for it.  It will be particularly difficult for Enron to 
exempt itself from costs incurred by the state on behalf of Enron's 
customers.  Prior to us pushing amendments on this bill, can we discuss on 
the 11:30 call today.  Harry and I have discussed this at length, and I just 
want to make sure that we don't blow up the whole enchilada by trying to get 
an amendment here.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: Re: Language on bonds

Hedy, Scott, Bev -  the language currently says the bond surcharge will apply 
"to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations ..."  
I know this is a longshot, but is there any chance of having this amended to 
either 

1) exclude volumes under DA contracts as of the effective date of this act, 
or 
2) more generally leave it to the PUC to adjust the surcharge for customer 
classes based on their contribution - or lack thereof - to DWR's purchasing 
requirements.

The justification for this exemption is grounded in excluding customers who 
have not caused the DWR problem; e.g. large San Diego customers or PGE/SCE 
customers who have been DA  the last couple years or parts thereof.  (We can 
give you some specific language.)

Hedy or Scott - could you please call me when you get in - 713 853-5786.  
Thanks.

Senator Burton's office expects bond language back from Legislative
Counsel sometime tomorrow, Tuesday.  As soon as we get a copy we will
forward it.  If the language is acceptable to Enron, then Bev, Scott and
I need to visit with Republicans to urge their support as soon as
possible.We are continuing to coordinate with the big users and some
other suppliers on this issue.

Scheduled blackout plan gaining favor
LIMITING PRICES: 3-state buyers' cartel with Northwest could create leverage

More blackouts but no ransom payments for energy gougers -- that's a deal 
looking increasingly attractive to California lawmakers and consumer 
advocates.

The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the 
cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, is for the state to set a firm ceiling 
on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not 
one dime more.

The trade-off would be certain blackouts, possibly more than if the state 
continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand.

Some advocates of the idea think that California could minimize the number of 
blackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by 
scheduling service interruptions.

"We need to stop this game of electricity chicken," said Michael Shames, 
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, which first proposed the 
idea. "We are likely to see blackouts this summer; we should use them to our 
advantage rather than be victimized by them."

The plan calls for creating a "buyers' cartel" of California, Oregon and 
Washington. Essentially, the states would decide at what price they were 
willing to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level.

The state has spent $6 billion on energy purchases since January, and at one 
point during last week's power shortage was spending $1,900 per megawatt hour 
-- more than 10 times what Davis has planned on for this summer. That kind of 
spending cannot go on, Democratic Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek 
said yesterday.

"The question is, can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the 
state maintain economic stability? I believe the answer is no," said Keeley, 
the lower house's main figure on energy policy and author of the bill that 
put the state in the power-buying business.

"To get this problem solved, we have to think in bold terms," said Keeley, 
who introduced a resolution along with fellow Democratic Assemblyman Paul 
Koretz of West Hollywood that urged Davis to form a cartel.


THREE STATES ARE BETTER THAN ONE
Davis said last week that "my bias would be to keep the lights on at any 
price." But yesterday, the governor said a temporary price limit is 
"certainly a matter we've talked about and considered at some length. The 
next step will be to see how the governors of Oregon and Washington respond 
to it."

A spokesman for Gov. Gary Locke of Washington said the matter is being 
considered. Calls to the office of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber were not 
returned.

The idea has appeal among some consumers who believe, as many state officials 
do, that California is being gouged for electricity.

"I can see if our bills were $20 or $30 more, but this is ridiculous," said 
Kimberly Chambers, an 18-year-old fashion design student from Oakland. 
"Whatever it takes, I don't think we should have to pay for more."

But Yunah Kim, 36, who moved to the Bay Area from New York a month ago, said 
blackouts should not even be considered.

"The infrastructure of government is coming apart, and it's the basic service 
government is able to provide," she said. "Businesses are not going to put up 
with that. It's very shortsighted. We just have to pay until there's a 
solution."

Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute 
in Berkeley, said blackouts might be worse than supporters of price limits 
believe.

"I think they (power companies) would call our bluff," and sell their 
electricity elsewhere, Borenstein said. "I don't think the state has the 
ability to credibly commit to paying no more than 'X.' That would be a very 
controversial decision."

Legislation is already in the works to give Davis the ability to enter into a 
West Coast buyers cartel. A bill sponsored by state Sen. Dede Alpert, D- 
Coronado, would allow the Independent System Operator to refuse to buy power 
if it is too expensive.

The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such 
things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers 
would be built in, supporters said.


LOOKING FOR SOME CONTROL
Alpert said everyone wants to avoid blackouts, but that seems unlikely.

"Everybody I talked to -- once you establish that there will be blackouts --

both businesses and residents say, let's have control," Alpert said.

The California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned a 
recent report that said unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21. 
8 billion and 135,000 jobs, is considering whether scheduled interruptions 
would be less harmful.

"The problem if we do (scheduled blackouts) is that we may have an inordinate 
amount of blackouts," said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the group.


NO EASY TASK
The ISO, which runs the state's power grid, is scheduled to issue a report 
tomorrow on how scheduled blackouts might work.

Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, said that planning blackouts is not as 
easy as it sounds.

"The difficulty is a pragmatic one -- the circuits are not wired to deal with 
choices like we are having to make," said Bowen, who has been holding 
hearings on how the state might better manage blackouts.

"Maybe we should be paying people to turn off their fuse box," Bowen said.

Greetings:
In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to 
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't 
make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on 
the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.

Best,
Jeff

SUMMARY
Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of 
the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the 
calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take 
the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and 
advocating whatever plan the group develops.
Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible 
process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for 
however long it takes to work out a resolution.
It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of 
next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be 
brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B."  Plan B is 
a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to 
the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a 
copy of "Plan B."  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number.
Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in meeting on 
Friday.
Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings agency 
level" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the 
presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to 
issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:  The Credit Issue
Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's 
meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.  
Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the 
start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California 
PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for 
power services delivered.  
If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  

Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting 
the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution.
Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The 
following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a 
starting point for discussion.
Utility creditworthiness
retail rates must reflect costs
Increase supply
streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
Decrease demand
establish real-time pricing
implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
Create a real market
Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., 
once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; 
approximately 3-6 months)
Return the procurement role to the utilities
Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for 
electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas
Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, 
etc. 
Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that 
discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)

Bowen brought up the FERC order on 4 RTOs issued today. She said this 
ratchets everything else up in the state and what they want to do on buying 
the state transmission lines.

I heard Peace mutter just then; "Ken Lay is behind that."

Priggish and piggish in California

Mark Steyn
National Post
A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but 
no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's 
radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South 
Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island, 
demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio 
station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village, 
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island 
was without electricity.
And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's 
colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside 
there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's 
nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New 
Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa, 
Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact 
with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British 
supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when 
it's safe to do so.
Now that's living off the grid.
The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in 1658, and it's been 
a Crown colony since 1834, populated by a handful of families from the 
Scottish borders. There are just seven surnames on the island: Glass, Green, 
Hagan, Lavarello, Repetto, Rogers and Swain. All 290 of them turned up in 
London 40 years ago, when the island's volcano erupted and they were 
evacuated to the Imperial capital. In the roaring traffic's boom, midst the 
glitter of one of the world's great cities, the islanders voted to return 
home -- though even getting there was tricky, as their landing dock was 
covered in lava. Today the colony is virtually self-sufficient in food and 
has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its 
commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists.
London has offered o75,000 to repair the communications equipment and pay for 
a new hospital. (You can build a hospital for under 75,000 quid? Amazing.) 
Otherwise, the islanders are just doing what they usually do: making the best 
of things. While they're waiting for the new hospital, they've arranged for a 
South African fishing vessel to ferry out a second-hand X-ray machine when it 
sails next week.
Now, consider by way of contrast, the inhabitants of what George W. Bush 
amusingly calls "the great state of California." Once upon a time, California 
was, like they say of Tristan da Cunha, "the furthest thing," at least in 
terms of the North American continent. Today, with a population the size of 
Canada's, it's one of the world's largest economies, the home base of 
America's biggest industry -- entertainment. But inside many a studio 
vice-president is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out. Deep in 
their hearts (assuming, for the purposes of discussion, that studio 
vice-presidents have hearts), they share the same rugged virtues as the 
Tristanians, though they prefer something a little better than a $100,000 
hospital and they've no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish, but 
if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end he's welcome to try.
And therein lies the contradiction. California's self-inflicted energy crisis 
has exposed the preposterousness of poseur-conservationism in a booming 
economy. Which state has the most rigorous conservation program? California. 
Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption? California. And 
which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts? By 
now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that 
conservation is not a viable policy for a non-stagnant economy.
Instead, a rolling blackout here, a rolling blackout there, and they're 
running around like headless chickens. Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at 
everyone in sight -- Bush and Cheney are "irresponsible," the power 
generators are "unconscionable" -- no, wait, they're "snakes" and "robber 
barons." And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay, CEO 
of Enron Corp.? "I would love," said Bill Lockyer, California's 
Attorney-General, "to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could 
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "
As the state's Attorney-General, Mr. Lockyer cannot summarily sentence 
citizens to anal rape, but no doubt, once the guy's convicted, he can make 
some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates. Fortunately for Mr. 
Lay, as chief exec of the world's largest energy trader, he doesn't live in 
California, he lives in Texas. Indeed, very few of the folks the State of 
California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction: 
Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia, whose BC Hydro has been living 
high off the hog on California's woes, could also use a little light buggery, 
but I can't see a Canadian court approving extradition. Nevertheless, in a 
state that's over-regulated, bans new power plants and is addicted to price 
caps, Mr. Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another 
disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to La-la-land.
California bought into the soft-eco Sierra Club illusion -- that somehow one 
could be a conservationist, with no consequences for one's economic 
well-being. To put it in terms Californians can understand: Suppose you build 
a house out in the desert. But you don't want to buy a car, because that's 
bad for the environment, isn't it? So instead every morning you call a 
taxicab in the city to drive out, pick you up and take you into the office. 
Not only does it have no environmental benefit but there's no point bitching 
and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to 
the cost of gas.
Yet that's what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding: price 
caps. Through its own incompetence, California is wholly dependent on energy 
generators and distributors from other jurisdictions. But it expects those 
companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service 
California -- i.e., Hollywood and Silicon Valley -- as an act of public 
welfare. "A 500% profit is swine-like, piggish and totally unreasonable," 
says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange.
She may have a point, but, if California's going to institute price caps, 
they might like to start closer to home. After all, if Enron's board members 
don't really need those big salaries, do Paramount's or Universal's? I mean, 
sure, Ken Lay has an easy job, but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in 
Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every 
couple of months? I mean, surely, the guy could do the job on, oh, $25,000 a 
year. And that'd be good for conservation, 'cause he'd have to give up the 
Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus. And how about 
Travolta? Instead of $20-million per picture, maybe he could get by on just 
two or three and the remaining $17-million could be put into those renewable 
energy projects he's so keen on. I mean, a $20-million salary isn't just 
swine-like, it's piggish, right?
Since its entry into the Union, California has had what we 19th-century 
imperialists call "responsible government." Tristan da Cunha doesn't. Yet its 
community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than 
California's. Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an 
American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony, feverishly 
cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him. You're on your own, 
man. And, if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous, 
they should try spending a week in the dark, cut off from the outside world 
and knowing that, even when the radio starts working again, it's going to 
take months for the second-hand X-ray machine to arrive.

 Contracts--Privileged and Confidential

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the 
past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's 
electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small 
customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States 
Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to 
achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in 
California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from 
the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the 
utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers 
would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close 
devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the 
utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January 
and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR 
contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore 
structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the 
contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large 
customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR 
contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to 
address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) 
killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure 
focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not 
include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any 
"out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract 
provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the 
state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might 
reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear 
that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally 
abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some 
options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the 
core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM 
PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let 
me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff

Mercury News, 7/3: Blackout hits Las Vegas

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------


Blackout hits Las Vegas as number 120 comes up 
And California calls its first power alert since May as the mercury soars. 
July 3, 2001 
>From staff and news service reports 
Las Vegas suffered its first rolling blackout ever Monday as soaring 
temperatures and churning air conditioners outstripped the local utility's 
ability to provide electricity. 
Nevada Power Co. cut about 100 megawatts, or enough electricity for 75,000 
homes, for about an hour. 
Scattered outages were reported around the Las Vegas area, where temperatures 
reached 120 degrees. Earlier, the utility asked its major power users, 
including the neon-lit resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, for voluntary 
reductions. Casinos instituted conservation measures largely not noticeable 
by guests. 
Meanwhile, in California, high temperatures led the Independent System 
Operator to declare an emergency alert for the first time since May 31. 
A Stage 1 alert was called at 1:35 p.m. as reserves fell below 7 percent of 
demand. The alert was upgraded to a Stage 2 at 2:40 p.m., meaning reserves 
fell below 5 percent. 
The alert didn't trigger new wholesale price limits under a system recently 
ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Under the FERC rules, a 
Stage 1 alert must be in effect for a full clock hour (i.e., 2 to 3 p.m.) to 
reset the caps, said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the ISO. Since the 
Stage 1 was upgraded to Stage 2 before a clock hour passed, that condition 
was not met, she said. The cap, designed to prevent price spikes, remains at 
$92 a megawatt-hour.

Davis' criticism of Texas misdirected, report finds 
Lynda Gledhill, Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writers
Tuesday, July 10, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/10/M
N48875.DTL 
Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of 
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power 
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share 
of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of 
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private 
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the 
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting 
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting 
against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure and 
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most 
of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying 
the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators 
who have also gouged California. 
"Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across 
their face because they are robbing us blind," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state 
Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from 
Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are 
made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually 
used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most 
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and 
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped 
as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events 
that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover 
from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in 
receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, 
an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents 
subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged 
market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, 
received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged 
higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 
million.

Beyond the two excellent editorials in today's WSJ (attached) the following 
should be the key messages:

1.  The show was an aimless wander through the well-worn territory of 
blame-game politics, with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in.

2.  It should not surprise anyone that two Berkley-based journalists, working 
in conjunction with the New York Times, would ignore Econ 101 and suggest 
that the solution for California's energy crisis is to subject the entire 
nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations.  Such pinings have been 
abandoned over the past 65 years, but if the New York Times wants to stake 
out that position ... fine.  It will probably help sharpen the debate and set 
up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices 
moderate.  (Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New 
Deal regulations.)

3.  The show completely ignored the failings of California's political and 
regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had 
a chance.

4.  Of the electricity consumed in California, less than 15 percent is 
generated by companies headquartered in Texas.  More than 50 percent of the 
electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been 
charging the same high prices as the Texas "pirates."  These good pirates 
include the Bonneville Power Administration, the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power, the Government of British Columbia, and the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District.




Business World: California's Ship of Fools
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

06/06/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A27
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Lamenting the politician's lot in "Profiles in Courage," John F. Kennedy 
wrote that "In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice 
honors, prestige and his chosen career on a single issue." Of course, no 
politician would last long if he didn't blow with the wind nine times out of 
10. But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some 
courage. 
We don't know what happens when an advanced economy like California's suffers 
day after day of blackouts. We may be about to find out. Modern office 
architecture becomes uninhabitable without air-conditioning and elevators. 
Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat. So may drivers at unlit 
traffic crossings.
Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts, but voters wouldn't know 
the difference, and it's so much easier to cast blame. Gov. Gray Davis prates 
about a "war with Texas." And who knows what secret failures as a human being 
led Bill Lockyer, the attorney general, to threaten Enron's Ken Lay with 
homosexual rape in the California prison system. 
California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of 
crisis. Mr. Lockyer and Mr. Davis harp on price, but the true problem is the 
unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the 
current structure of retail rates. 
Both must know the solution they noisily advocate, federal price controls 
slapped across Western electricity markets, wouldn't bring power into 
existence to close the gap. Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with 
the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from California's mistakes across 
half a dozen other states. 
In California itself, municipal utilities in Santa Clara, Palo Alto and other 
towns have already announced they won't participate in rolling blackouts. The 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isn't volunteering. Why 
should voters in other states? Why not just cut the lines and let California 
monopolize the darkness? A state review board in Washington has already 
vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined 
for California. 
Mr. Davis knows this; he knows price controls would create a new problem 
without solving the shortages. Meanwhile, the specter nobody wants to talk 
about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues 
to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded 
from the true cost of power. 
Mr. Davis's version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame. Texas companies 
account for just 12% of California's supply, having bought 7,000 of the 
20,000 megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under 
"deregulation." Being in the right place at the right time has always been 
profitable, but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas, 
pipeline capacity, storage and ancillary services. Take Enron: Its revenues 
quadrupled in the past year, but so did its costs, and profits are up only 
31%. 
A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest "gougers" BC Hydro, 
owned by Canadian taxpayers, and the U.S. Bonneville Power Administration. 
Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local 
needs with spot-market power, so they could sell their own production for 
higher prices to California during the day. 
These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed 
across the West, making the shortages worse, probably much worse. 
Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro they've 
been passing on to California -- 3,000 megawatts, enough for two million 
homes. Farmers could resume irrigating. Seattle, Tacoma, Boise and other 
neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do, hiking rates to 
curb demand. 
Rather than emulate them, Gov. Davis's peacock of an energy czar, David 
Freeman, babbles about "public power," the answer to a question nobody asked, 
the solution to a nonexistent problem. 
Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling 
as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the state's 
future needs. Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr. Freeman's antique 
New Deal schemes. What's been missing while folks like him ride their hobby 
horses, though, is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the 
suffering this summer. 
One large source of untapped power is California's own small generators, 
known as qualifying facilities. Their fee scale is set by the state, but 
California couldn't even summon the political competence to keep them in 
business, so 3,000 megawatts sit idle. 
People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the 
California mess, but we wouldn't be here if water flows in the Columbia River 
system weren't down 54% from normal. Last summer, California's fossil-fuel 
generators increased their output by a whopping 62% to make up the shortfall, 
mostly by running existing plants harder. 
Yes, there have been flaky prices, partly because, mysteriously, California 
continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its 
power one hour in advance. But the flaky prices also represent a system 
pulling out all stops to save California from itself. 
We said back in December there's only one solution: Jack up rates to stop 
consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg, borrow or steal. 
The only question was when Gov. Davis would find the courage. Hard to 
believe, but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on 
the drawing board and busily being watered down. 
Someone should point out to Gov. Davis that the author of "Profiles in 
Courage" wasn't endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must 
husband their leadership for times when it really counts. Not a few people in 
public life understand this. Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could 
justify the compromises and trimming he's done in his life. But Mr. Davis is 
perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to 
have a political career. 
What borders on the stupefying, though, is the failure of any other 
Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power 
crisis. By all rights Gov. Davis should be a political leper, yet he actually 
stands a microscopic chance of being re-elected because of the sheer poverty, 
in a state of 34 million people, of the Republican opposition. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
California Squeaks By

06/06/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A26
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray 
Davis has done nothing but squeak at it. At first, he attacked out-of-state 
power generators for being pirates and marauders. But lately he has focused 
on FERC and President Bush, demanding that the federal government place price 
caps on the sale of wholesale power. He's even rustled up 10 economists -- 
including the dad of deregulation, Alfred Kahn -- to support him. 
Well, as most everybody knows -- including the economists who have come out 
in favor of them -- price caps don't work. If caps are set too low, (as 
politics often dictate), existing supply will shrink and demand will grow, 
making the situation worse. Even "correctly" set price caps will discourage 
additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand. The usual result is an 
aggravation of shortages and rationing. Indeed, the history of price caps, 
particularly during the energy crisis in the early 1970s -- when oil prices 
were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long -- bears this out.
The pro-price-caps argument however is a clever one. It rests on the notion 
that there is no "effective competition" in the California energy market. 
According to one of the 10 pro-price-cap economists, Paul Joskow at MIT, the 
energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very, 
very tight supplies, which conspire to produce, at certain times, prices 
above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions. 
Mr. Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of 2000, 
looking at market fundamentals (the broad forces determining supply and 
demand); he found that 25% to 30% of the wholesale prices of electricity 
during June, July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and 
should be attributed to market imperfections. 
As an argument for price caps, this is hardly overwhelming. Especially since 
there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no 
further than market fundamentals. Such as the fact that the price of the most 
important input for almost half the electricity generated in California, 
natural gas, has been rising over the past year. Such as the fact that 
natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity, thus bidding up the price to 
transmit. Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in 60 
years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market, putting 
even more demands on natural gas generation. Such as the fact that imports 
into the state, which were running 20% and up to 25% during peak usage, have 
declined. And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions 
-- which must be held by plants generating electricity -- has skyrocketed. 
Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years, 
unfettered by rate increases, has zoomed dramatically. 
At any rate, electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country; 
indeed, California's neighbors, the states of Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, 
Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Montana, have had to bump up utility rates 
30% to 50%. So where is the tablet of stone saying that California, with its 
especially restrictive environmental regulations, should be any different? 
The bad news for California is that, poor dears, it can't be different. 
Market fundamentals, like supply and demand, rule. But that's also the good 
news. High wholesale prices (and necessary profits) have done their job; they 
have brought forth a number of suppliers, in the form of more than a dozen 
plans for significant new generating plants; in fact, plans have even been 
announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines. Too, demand has 
started to abate; peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen 4% to 9% from 
last year, doubtless a response to a "temporary" 10% rate hike in January and 
the California Public Utilities Commission's decision in March to finally 
really, really raise rates by as much as 50% on average. (The details of that 
plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this month's 
bills.) 
So California's blame-shifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes 
over. The market is working, and imposing price caps would not only interrupt 
that process, but would be unnecessary. Of course, there is a painful lag 
between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market 
remedies of increased supply and lower demand. And California will probably 
feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and 
blackouts. 
But, in the long run, the market will be successful in creating new supply 
and lower prices. Unfortunately California's energy glut will probably come 
too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery. Ultimately 
we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has 
served them poorly.

Governor's myths

We have known for some time that Gray Davis is a much better fundraiser and
political spin doctor than he is a Governor, but lately he is taking the
spin way too far. He is so desperate to find villains with whom he can
deflect focus from his own record that he continues to ignore facts. Here is
my effort to set the record straight on several of the Governor's, and his
lackeys, recent 
pronouncements on energy and the budget. 
Energy:
MYTH:  "All Texans are evil"
His spokesman said, "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have
handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind." 
Why he said it: George Bush is from Texas and is a convenient scapegoat.
FACT: Only 2 of the 12 largest energy suppliers to California are from Texas
and they provide only 9% of the state's energy use.  

MYTH:  "Private power generators charged California the most"
Governor Davis said, "What's going on here, pure and simple, is
unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers."
Why he said it: Polls show that it is easier to blame power generators for
the energy crisis than anyone else. FACT: The private company power
generators charged substantially lower prices over the last few months for
energy than the public agencies.  In fact, documents recently released
reveal that Enron and Mirant averaged $181 and $225 per megawatt while LADWP
and Sacramento Municipal averaged $292 and $330 for energy sold to the state
during the first quarter of this year.  

MYTH:  "Power companies manipulated prices" 
Governor Davis said,  "Their testimony could be the "smoking gun" that
demonstrates there was improper manipulation of California's electricity
market."  
Why he said it: another way to say, "its not my fault, its their fault"
FACT: Duke energy shut its plant down because it was ordered to, in order to
balance the grid, by the California ISO, an entity overseen entirely by
Davis appointees. 
Budget:
MYTH:  "Republicans want to cut education spending"
A lead education appointee said, "We feel very strongly that agreeing to
that would put us in a position where children would lose." Why it was said:
he needs to think of something to justify his tax increase. FACT:
Republicans have never proposed cuts in education out of the current budget.
We have instead proposed reducing pork, entirely new or expanded 
programs, and cutting funded but vacant bureaucratic positions. 

MYTH:  "The $1.2 billion sales tax increase is not a tax increase"
The Governor said, "They've just invented this argument about a tax
increase. It's just nonsense. It's not a tax increase." 
Why he said it: he wants to maintain the illusion of being a fiscal
conservative FACT: One year ago, when the sales tax was cut, Davis had a
news conference announcing "This tax decrease will benefit every
Californian.  It will put even more of our prosperity in the hands of those
who created it in the first place - the taxpayers of this State." Now, when
the same tax goes up, it is not a tax increase? 
I will let you figure out for yourself whether or not these myths are indeed
myths -- I only hope that you won't be using the Governor's statements for
your facts.

Until next week, that's all for this week.

For those of you who might be interested, William Simon, a  Republican 
candidate for governor in California, spoke to the Sacramento Press  Club at 
a lunch I attended today.? Simon is the son of the late William E.  Simon, 
the former Treasury Secretary.
?
During his presentation, he made a few comments abou the  energy situation 
in?CA:
?
A former U.S. attorney and Rudy Guiliani protege, it bothers  him that Gov. 
Davis has made a point of prejudging generators and marketers  before 
investigations are complete (Simon supports full investigations into  
generator/marketer practices).? He also called Bill Lockyer's "Spike" quote  
inappropriate, and said it violates the canon of ethics to threaten  
prosecution.
?
He believes it is a mistake to buy the transmission lines and  that the focus 
should be on increasing supply.? The rhetoric coming from  the governor and 
AG "do nothing but chill investment," and said he doesn't blame  Mirant for 
its hesitation to build new plants.
?
If the current energy situation were in his lap, he would  approach?it by 
getting everybody to the table?to try to find an  overall solution.? It's 
being done piecemeal now, he said, and that's not  effective.
?
He sees three elements to?addressing the  problem:
1.? Limit state involvement -- he does not support a  public power authority;
2.? Get supply online;
3.??"Restructure,"?which he related to taking a  sagging company and figuring 
out a concerted approach?to fixing its  problems rather than?putting out fire 
after fire.? 
?
He believes the generators should relieve some of the  debt.
?
He was asked if?an Edison bankruptcy?would be a bad  thing.??He said 
it?"can't be good," but prefers to?think  of?Edison's status as a 
consideration to the overall approach but not  necessarily as the ultimate 
goal.? He indicated that bankruptcy is not  favorable but should not 
necessarily be avoided at any  cost.

PG&E Says National Energy Group Assets May Be at Risk (Correct)

PG&E Says National Energy Group Assets May Be at Risk (Correct)

     (Corrects second paragraph to reflect National Energy Group
doesn't hold utility's generating facilities and gas plants.)

     New York, May 8 (Bloomberg) -- Creditors of PG&E Corp.'s
bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric utility unit may be able to grab
assets of PG&E National Energy Group, a subsidiary the parent had
intended to insulate, PG&E told the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
     By February this year, PG&E had restructured National Energy
Group hoping to isolate the new unit's assets. The structure
allowed National Energy Group to get a separate credit rating and
borrow funds without affecting other units.
     In its filing, PG&E said creditors may try to link payments
between the utility and the parent to $349 million in capital
contributions that PG&E made to National Energy Group in 2000,
including $250 million transferred in the fourth quarter. National
Energy Group's investment grade credit ratings, which were
affirmed following Pacific Gas's April 6 bankruptcy, were based on
the assumption that the new structure insulated the assets.
     ``Bankruptcy law is designed to scrutinize the transactions
between the company and those with inside influence that took
place before the bankruptcy filing,'' Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard
Law School professor, said prior to the filing. ``You do that so
creditors can be compensated.''
     On Feb. 20, Moody's Investors Service gave the National
Energy Group an investment grade long-term rating of ``Baa2.'' The
ratings company said the company's legal structure and independent
financing strategy protect it from PG&E creditors that may attempt
to force a consolidation or bankruptcy.

                    Insolvent Transfers

     Under the federal bankruptcy laws, when a company that's
insolvent transfers assets to a parent and gets less than fair
value, the bankruptcy court can unwind the transaction. The court
can also undo asset transfers intended either to defraud
creditors.
     PG&E said it couldn't assure that fraudulent transfer claims
in Pacific Gas's Chapter 11 case wouldn't be successful. If any
such claims do succeed, they may have a significantly adverse
impact, the company said. PG&E said it thinks Pacific Gas was
solvent when it made payments to the parent and that creditors
hadn't been defrauded.
     In some circumstances, bankruptcy judges can undo corporate
restructurings. In this case, National Energy Group's assets could
be lumped with its parent's and used to pay off creditors.
     PG&E said such a combination of assets, known as substantive
consolidation, ``is an exception rather than the rule.''
     Another risk is the possibility that California regulators
may try and rescind payments that PG&E made to National Energy
Group, the parent said in the filing.
     The California Public Utilities Commission began an
investigation of intercompany payments between all parts of the
PG&E corporate structure on April 3.
     The filing disclosed that National Energy Group has more than
$2.22 billion of short- and long-term debt, including debt to its
parent, as of Dec. 31.
     PG&E owns all the stock of the National Energy Group, which
it used as collateral for a $1 billion loan arranged by General
Electric Capital Corp. and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. If PG&E
defaults on the loan, control of the company would move to the
creditors, which may cause a default under certain obligations of
the National Energy Group, the filing said.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 
"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
"Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Cal-ISO/FERC -2: Companies Allegedly Gamed Power Market
Updated: Friday, June 8, 2001 05:29 PM ET   Email this article to a friend!

 Printer-friendly version

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator has
filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power
suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates
because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market.  Duke
Energy (DUK, news, msgs), Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs), Mirant Corp. (MIR,
news, msgs) and Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news, msgs) have been identified
by the ISO as exercising market power - the ability to influence
electricity prices - in California's wholesale power market.

The ISO, which manages the state's high-voltage transmission system,
recently made a similar filing against AES Corp. (AES, news, msgs) and
Williams Cos. (WMB, news, msgs), claiming those companies have profited
excessively in California by exercising market power.  The ISO wants the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators' authority to
charge market-based rates for their power supply.

Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company had just received
the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations.  "We've obviously just
got the filing and we're reviewing it and we are going to respond with our
own FERC filing. But we're also gratified that market forces are at work in
California and prices have come down," Williams said.

Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said the ISO's allegations are
"nothing new."  "It's similar in nature to issues and allegations that have
been raised against other generators," Wheatley said. "The ISO is incorrect
in asking for emergency relief. The situation in California remains to be
an imbalance between supply and demand. The blame game prohibits lasting
solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be
affected by finger pointing."

Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor
"strongly supports any attempt to bring prices down for Californians and to
break the grip a handful of generators have on the electricity market."

The ISO has asked FERC to terminate by June 28 Dynegy's ability to charge
market prices for power from its Southern California power plants and to
schedule a hearing to determine rates based on the energy company's
production costs.  The grid operator also wants Dynegy to refund billions
of dollars, retroactive to May 1, "of the difference between cost-based
rates...and the market revenues actually received."  Similar requests were
made with FERC against Duke, Reliant and Mirant.

"The ISO has submitted compelling evidence that the exercise of market
power is more pervasive than the commission has acknowledged...," according
to the filing.  In the filing, generators have also been accused of
"megawatt-laundering," in which suppliers sell power out-of-state that is
resold to California at a higher price.

California consumers have spent $7 billion for wholesale electricity in
1999, $27 billion in 2000 and could pay as much as $50 billion this year.

Charles Robinson, the ISO's chief counsel, said he is "optimistic" the
state will prevail "in one forum or another and will be able to get the
relief we're seeking."  He said FERC should implement an "effective" market
mitigation plan that will put the brakes on skyrocketing wholesale power
prices.  FERC set up a market mitigation plan, which went into effect June
1, to stabilize wholesale power prices when operating reserves dip below
7%. Robinson said that plan wasn't good enough.

Wholesale power prices were at a seven-month low Thursday, due in part to
the new FERC plan, cooler temperatures, low natural-gas prices, and
conservation measures, energy officials said.

Every three years, FERC reviews generators' ability to charge market rates
for electricity. Generators were first allowed to charge market rates three
years ago, but it is unclear whether FERC has ever stripped suppliers from
their right to charge market prices.

We have confirmed that there is no current agenda item pending for the CPUC
to act on banning direct access.  Having said that, there are reports from
highly placed staff that an item to implement the AB-1X ban is being held in
Bilas' office, as he would like to see the legislative process run its
course, but there is a possibility that Lynch will reassign the matter to
another commissioner who opposes direct acess (Wood)in an effort to kill DA
before any other legislation is passed.  Please note:  The foregoing is
internal speculation/gossip from within the commission, and should not be
considered as confirmed.  Notwithstanding the controversy over implementing
AB 1X, Commissioner Brown has written a letter to Bowen endorsing direct
access and her bill, and publicly supported direct access in the Commission
meeting today.  That means 3 commissioners have voiced support for DA, and
only 2 opposed.  This again raises doubts over the accuracy of Bowen's
statement--which may have been designed to scare opponents into supporting
her bill.  We are attempting to get a copy of the letter sent by Brown and
will forward it to the lobbyists if we obtaining.  Stay tuned.  Mike Day

SBX2 27 (Bowen) passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on a
7-5 party-line vote.  In her closing, Senator Bowen said that if the
supporters of direct access do not want to help her with her bill she
would just as soon let if fail.  She also stated that the CPUC was going
to terminate direct access next week.  There was one additional
amendment taken which specifies that DWR must inform customers within 30
days of an inquiry what the projected exit fee will be.

Subject:  JDS Uniphase Corporation Strongly Supports
      Retention of Direct Access and asks for CPUC Support

Dear Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown:

My name is Kenneth D. Pietrelli, Vice President of Corporate Services for the
Thin Film Products Group(formerly OCLI and Flex Products) of JDS Uniphase in
Santa Rosa, California.  I am asking for your support to retain Direct Access 
as
an option for industrial energy customers such as JDS Uniphase.  Electricity 
and
natural gas are critical infrastructural requirements for our manufacturing
processes.  Without access to reliable sources, at high quality and 
competitive
prices we cannot satisfy our customers needs and be a viable business in
California.  We fear loss of direct access will have a material, adverse 
effect
on our business in California where we currently employ approximately 5,000
employees. JDS Uniphase is made up of such diverse groups as the original
Uniphase Commercial Lasers Group in San Jose and Manteca, the E-Tek Dynamics
Company in San Jose, SDLI in San Jose and Santa Clara and OCLI and Flex 
Products
in Santa Rosa.  The corporation has over 20,000 employees in over 20 
countries.
Of all the sites in California only the Santa Rosa site has direct access, 
which
is due to various historical and operational reasons.  We own a 22Mw 
substation
located on our 75 acre plant site and are considered a grid level customer.  
Up
to now we have enjoyed high quality, reliable electrical energy.  In the mid
1990's we began contracting directly for natural gas from other than PG& E and
are currently sourcing gas from Pan Canadian Energy via a single point gas 
meter
for the site.  In 1998 we entered into a 5 year direct access electricity
contract with PG& E Energy Services.  In 2000 this contract was assigned by 
PG&E
Energy Services to Enron and is valid through June 30, 2003.   Because of the
importance of energy availability, quality and price to our manufacturing
operations we have made business decisions on where capital investments have
been made and where redundant operations would be consolidated.  We are in the
process of a global re-alignment program that is consolidating numerous
activities to Santa Rosa, CA for a variety of reasons, to include our direct
access to energy.

 If direct access is eliminated in California, JDS Uniphase management will 
have
to re-assess and re-consider actions currently underway to consolidate
manufacturing from Rochester, NY; Ottawa, Canada; Dunfermline Fife, Scotland;
and San Jose, Ca to the Santa Rosa, CA site. Other locations on the East Coast
of the U.S., China, UK, etc. would have to be re-considered for these
consolidation activities.  Selfishly, we are asking you to retain direct 
access
to keep jobs in California.  Philosophically, we believe the "right to choose"
is an American tradition and anyone concerned with the long-term health and
viability of the California economy would want to retain the direct access
option for California customers.   Thanks for your time and support.

Press Release

Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for 
Solutions

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2001--Reliant Energy strongly disagrees 
with California Governor Gray Davis' recent characterization of the company 
as being ``obstructionist'' and opposing court orders.

Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated 
attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing 
the state's energy crisis. The accusations are simply not based on fact. More 
importantly, the governor's attacks have done nothing to increase the state's 
supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer. If 
anything, the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and 
uncertainty that have further destabilized the market.

``Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations 
and focus on true solutions to California's energy shortage,'' said Joe Bob 
Perkins, president and chief operating officer, Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group. ``We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market, 
not government control of power generation, and we have offered solutions 
that do not jibe with the governor's political agenda. Contrary to the 
perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote, we have been focused on 
providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the 
outset of this crisis. In fact, earlier this week we provided the governor's 
office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that, if pursued 
quickly, could help mitigate the power crisis this summer. We are still 
waiting on a response.''

Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the 
lights on in California, disputing the accusation of being ``obstructionist'':

Reliant Energy has run its 30-to-50-year-old plants at the highest levels 
since their purchase in 1998. In 2000, Reliant nearly doubled the output from 
these plants to meet the needs of Californians -- running them at levels far 
exceeding the prior owner, Southern California Edison.

Reliant Energy invested $80 million dollars in 2000 alone to upgrade plants 
to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times. In 
addition, the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment 
and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum.

For the last two years, Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities 
and the state to invest in long-term contracts to stabilize rates instead of 
relying on the spot market. In particular, Reliant Energy offered to sell 
power at two cents per kilowatt-hour if the buyer would purchase the natural 
gas required to generate the power, ensuring a transparent cost of power.

Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns 
that continue to exist over credit issues. In contrast, just last week a 
major out-of-state supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless 
payment was forthcoming.

Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage 
businesses to ``sell back'' power voluntarily to add more power to the 
Western power grid. The company has met with many leaders in Western states 
to introduce the program, yet California officials will not even engage in a 
dialogue on the program.

``We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one with the 
governor,'' Perkins said. ``Unfortunately, he has repeatedly refused this 
request over the past year. Last week's meeting with generators was the first 
time the group was allowed to speak with him directly, and obviously the 
purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding.''

Perkins added that the governor's accusations of opposing court orders are 
unfounded. ``We have always worked within the law and are proud of our 
commitment to keeping the lights on. We have followed all court orders and 
worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all 
investigations. When necessary, we have filed court challenges to orders that 
we believe violate our rights -- hardly an illegal action.''

To participate in a telephone press conference tomorrow, Friday May 18 at 11 
a.m. PDT, contact Maxine Enciso at 310/444-1303 or Richard Wheatley at 
713/207-5881.

Commissioner Wood has issued extensive questions on direct access, continuing his harassment of ESPs.  He raises the issues of moving the termination date back from September 20 and supposed cost shifting.  He also asks for copies of contracts with customers and extensive information about those contracts. Comments are due Nov 2 with replies due Nov 8.  We plan to respond aggressively through our coalition, Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM). We WILL NOT be providing any contract information.

The CEO meetings on Thursday went very well, and we had great turnout.  
Attached is a final list of who Ken met with and a list of who we invited.  
The takeaway from both meetings was to draft a letter outlining our 
five-point solution proposal, and the CEOs would be willing to sign it and 
send to the governor and legislators.  Jeff and I drafted the letter and will 
finalize and send it to the CEOs on Monday.  I also think we ought to 
consider placing full-page ads with the letter and enlisting some of the CEOs 
to attend editorial boards.  At this point, it's important to keep Enron out 
of the picture.  We'll route the letter when it's finalized.  kd

The following are?summaries of today's appearance by  Sen. John Burton to the 
Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this  afternoon announcing a 
lawsuit against FERC.
?
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at  a?lunch with the 
Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about  the Edison MOU, 
which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee  for review, 
the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the  Natural 
Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.?  (One 
columnist commented that Burton would "love it to death," meaning it would  
get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
?
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight  by the PUC.? 
He said that will not be the case when it leaves the  Senate.
?
Burton is obviously troubled by?the MOU; he said "some  people" say it 
doesn't just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.?  He said the 
following would have to take place for the MOU to be  acceptable:
?

Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% "haircut";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an  amount close to 
what the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay  back debt.

?
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said "no" and  that he feels 
the parent should pay "a ton."? That led to a discussion of  the dedicated 
rate component, which he doesn't like.?He used  the example that if 
electricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is  $5, if prices drop 
to $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.? A  larger infusion of 
cash from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the  dedicated rate 
component. 
?
Burton called?the dedicated rate component a "big  problem" and said it could 
be the strongest argument for use in an initiative  campaign.
?
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that  the state should 
set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything  more (note:? 
this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support  from radio talk 
shows and other media).? He later threw out the number  $200.? The state is 
going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top  dollar, he said, so this 
is one way he sees to fight back.? It's tough  medicine, but as he put it, 
"You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy,  but two days later 
you're over it and your stomach's OK."
?
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how  he believe the 
situation should be handled:? "The only way to deal with  exploiters is to 
terrorize the bastards."
?
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU,  Burton said the 
MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing  progress there 
are allowances that would let the process go as long as into  December.
?
?
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
?
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to  announce a 
lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the 
Ninth Circuit.? A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier  this 
afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.? If  
additional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
?
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the  Senate; Bob 
Hertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City  of 
Oakland.? At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry  Brown, 
atty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty.  Clark 
Kelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz  
Figueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.? 
?
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling  within 21 days.
?
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not  fulfilling its 
statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.?  Hertzberg added 
that FERC had ignored the law and that they  were compelled to file suit for 
Californians' relief.
?
Joe Cotchett said the suit is "very basic" and is based on the  Federal Power 
Act, which he says limits power costs to "fair and justifiable"  rates.??A 
primary?strategy in this suit is to present it as a  "health and welfare" and 
public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million  disabled children and 
12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely  affected by blackouts.? 
He said it is "not an economic lawsuit -- it's  about senior citizens, 
disabled kids and convalescent facilities."? Today  also happened to be the 
legislative day for the California Association of Health  Facilities (the 
nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were  apparently 
asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
?
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were  opportunities 
to exert market power.? He also claimed that a Redondo Beach  facility 
(obviously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant  off-line 
and substituting higher rates.? He said, however, that this order  had been 
sealed.
?
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of  blackouts this 
summer, which could mean four hours a day.? That could be,  he said, 
"potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in  refrigeration."? Cotchett 
noted that only hospitals with more than 100 beds  are exempt from blackouts, 
which does not protect surgical centers or many  health facilities.
?
Jerry Brown added that "prices are unjust and people are  suffering."? 
Continued high prices could mean "potential civic disruption,"  and that 
there will be "more actions to mobilize" Western mayors.
?
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of  the lawsuit.
?
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV  here as a 
legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy,  in 
his Press Club appearance.? He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the  
media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the  
suit.?Burton's lawyer's sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it  
to?join the legal team.
?
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market  power for 
three years, and that the commission has delayed  action?unreasonably.? It 
has failed to define "fair and justifiable";  that failure, he said, violates 
the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of  the Constitution.
?
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon  "fellow 
Republicans" to support the effort.
?
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she  believed that 
if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than  California, the 
president and FERC would have acted long ago.
?
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing  is necessary 
because "5 generators supply 90%" of the electricity in CA and all  five have 
rate renewals before FERC.? He also said one of the cases that is  relevant 
is Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set  
standards (regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal  
Protection clause.? He also said six states have expressed interest in the  
case and have requested briefs:? Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington,  
Minnesota and one other he didn't name.? None of these states has yet  
committed to joining the suit.

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

This is an excerpt from the weekly newsletter of the Western power Trading 
Forum:


"California Attorney General Bill Lockyer made the major mud-slinging event 
of the
week.He said in Monday's WSJ,
"I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp.Chairman Kenneth ] Lay to an 8 
x 10 cell
that he could share with a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is 
Spike,honey,'"
I was depressed for two days after reading that.What is happening in this 
crazy place?
Elected officials are whipping up public fervor for a lynch mob?The statement 
was
beyond belief....

But here is a surprise that I didn't expect.Two days after the Lockyer quote 
was
published,Kathleen Connell called me,and expressed an apology for her 
"colleague's
statement regarding Enron.I want to distance myself,"she told me,"from that 
kind of
comment."We talked for about 15 minutes.I was stunned,and gratified by her 
remarks.
I asked if I could share her call with you folks,and she agreed."

2 proposed decisions were released last night by the California PUC - one by 
the Judge and one by Chairman Lynch.  

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law).  Each decision allocates a 
substantial portion of the subsidy to non-residential classes, although Lynch 
does this to a lesser extent
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers will be put in place; the 5th tier (300+% 
of baseline) gets a 35 cent per kwh rate
Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into 
summer on-peak were rejected.  About 60% of increase put into summer.  
Real Time Pricing was endorsed - will further explore in workshops starting 
later in May.  Voluntary program will be started.
In a vindictive outlash, Lynch decision requires federal facilities to pay 
market prices under new schedules to be developed by the utilities
Judge's decision seems to require surcharge to show up as a separate line 
item; Lynch's decision requires that it not be shown separately

Oral argument occurs Friday and final decision is expected to be voted out 
Monday, June 14.

All:

One thing to note is that while the DWR contracts are blended with the core, 
the non-core, if our curve come to be true, would enjoy the back end of the 
curve's lower price path.    

We calculated, based on the DWR's figures, the negative mark-to-maket at the 
various points in time:

6/02      $4.2B
12/02    $5.8B
6/03      $7.0B

While our curves differ, this gives an order of magnitute.

Subject: Concept for core/noncore Analysis

OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch 
some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.  Wanted to lay out 
the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest 
in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is 
the analysis that you're already working on:

Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03.
Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 
years).
Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the 
short for the core)
Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts 
the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's 
going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs 
attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date.

Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Regarding your voice mail, here is information on today's Dunn hearing:

While today's hearing is still going on, here is what transpired with
Edward Kahn as of 2:40 p.m..

Kahn went over his previously released SCE sponsored report on
withholding.  He discounted the Mirant sponsored Hogan report as
inconclusive and indicated that he will be releasing a response
shortly.  Kahn indicated that Tim Belden refuted his report at a meeting
in Santa Fe but that Tim would not "predictably" release hard copies of
his report.  Kahn also referenced an Enron document addressing his
report contained in an Enron FERC filing.  Senator Dunn told his staff
to make note of Tim's name and the reports.

Senator Dunn indicated that the committee is now in possession of
confidential ISO documents.

Regarding Pescetti, he called Smutney, Gary Ackerman and I into a
meeting.  Gary did not show up.  Anthony discussed four items he is
considering legislatively:

1) Edison deal minus the assets with a rate cap.  He is concerned that
if SCE goes under the state will implement the PPA through drastic
measures.
2) Establishing a 15 month cost-plus rate cap with one condition, the
state must build 10,000 mw within the 15 months or the cap will be
lifted.
3) Direct access (I told him to talk to Dave Kelley before he does
anything)
4) Expedited Path 15 legislation, perhaps with partial generator
funding.

He expressed interest in real time metering as a means to increase
conservation.  Smutney suggested using part of the PPA money to install
meters for all customers.  I told him Enron used these meters with great
success for the industrials.  Anthony had some concern with reliability
so I told him I would get information.  I'm working with Elizabeth
Linell on this.

He also expressed interest in buy-down so I gave him Enron's plan.

Anthony said he is working alone on these proposals.

Scott

Hertzberg called.  We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us 
to build for him.  I've attached the file.  the supporting spreadsheets are 
not included.  If folks would like them, let me know.  Please keep the file 
confidential.  

Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers 
if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to 
noncore customers.  
Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases 
when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to 
businesess (i.e., to noncore).  (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is 
below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.)
Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates 
significantly above the Lynch rates.  
Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that 
it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by 
the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates 
again soon. 
In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which 
will require yet additional increases.
I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or 
tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put 
100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive 
market and out from under Loretta).
I will report back after we've spoken.
All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome 
and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Executive Summary
? California Treasurer Angelides Sets Dates for Bridge Loans & Bonds
? California's Supreme Court May See Challenge to "Plan B"

Angelides on Bridge Loans and Bonds
CA Treasurer Angelides has said that beginning 15 August, the state will set 
up a bridge loan.  The revenue bonds will not be issued until September or 
October.  Angelides is not concerned about a cash crisis in July or August.  
However, he is quite worried about problems with cash flow in October and 
November.  This is based on calculations he has done with numbers from the 
DWR and from other parts of the government, not on payment terms for power.  
He fears there will be a cash management problem.

California Supreme Court to Challenge "Plan B"
California Attorney Michael Sturmwasser is expected to challenge "Plan B" 
before the California Supreme Court on the basis that it results in a 
retroactive rate increase and that it removes the PUC's authority to review 
power purchases.  This is because "Plan B" enables SoCal to collect a 
dedicated rate component to pay both its undercollect and its expenses going 
forward.  SoCal (and PG&E) would have to be guaranteed this dedicated rate 
component to be able to operate going forward and remain credit-worthy.  This 
takes the burden of financing the energy crisis away from the state and off 
the state's balance sheet, a key goal of lawmakers.  However, at the same 
time, it also abrogates the PUC from its responsibility to review power 
purchases.  The state cannot give the utilities a blank check (in the form of 
a dedicated rate component) to operate without taking authority away from the 
PUC.  According to the California constitution, the legislature can add to 
the responsibilities of the PUC, but it cannot take away powers from the 
PUC.  At the same time, ratepayers will be paying an additional surcharge for 
power that they have already used.  Sources describe Sturmwasser's case as 
"arguable"; in other words, it has a fair chance of succeeding.  However, 
regardless of whether the challenge succeeds or fails, it is very likely to 
cloud the issue of the bail-out and significantly deflate the prospects of 
the Plan B.

If FERC were to impose cost-based controls on power prices, sources believe 
it might "go a long way toward avoiding these problems."  Were this to 
happen, the PUC could declare FERC's rates "just and reasonable," which would 
likely greatly lessen the crisis and keep SoCal liquid.  However, such 
measures by FERC require significant lead time.  Sources state that "the 
state needs to tease the feds into doing this."  This can be done by 
conducting studies to obtain current cost data and update the data FERC would 
use for determining the cost controls.  Sources report that this process of 
"teasing" FERC has not yet started.  This is chiefly because California 
politicians are focused on flat price caps, which FERC is very unlikely to 
impose.  It appears the state is asking FERC for the wrong measures, which is 
delaying the process.  The only way for the state to avoid these 
constitutional issues would be for the state to purchase the utilities, as 
municipal entities would not be subject to PUC regulation.  However, there 
remains very significant opposition to this idea, especially on the 
Republican side.  A state purchase of the utilities would likely only gain 
momentum once Plan B began to fail for the reasons cited above.  
Additionally, a state purchase of the utilities would be less expensive were 
both utilities in bankruptcy.

Sturmwasser is a partner at Sturmwasser & Woocher, a Santa Monica law firm.  
(His offices are on the top floor of the tallest building in Santa Monica, 
overlooking the beach.)  He has been a utilities lawyer for over 30 years.  
His clients include the consumer advocacy group TURN (Toward Utilities Rate 
Normalcy), among others.  Sturmwasser will reportedly look for funding to 
support the legal challenge, but if he cannot find money elsewhere, he will 
likely be able to support it out of his own pocket.

in this group about the tour, so if it is going to occur, Greg Whalley would 
most likely want to participate and we need to arrange it with him.  Steve, 
let me know if you want me to call Greg.  

Tom Briggs and John Shelk's emails to me about this for your information (the

Subject: Response to FERC: EOL

Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting 
from their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise 
and incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  
Mark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim 
Bruno at FERC later today.

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform 
Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor 
operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to 
meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John 
Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" 
they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader 
subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or 
otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than 
the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the

Subject: Re: Trading Floor Visit  

For purposes of the congressional staff visit on July 13th -- and in general 
-- I think we are in agreement, as discussed at today's staff meeting, that 
when folks on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" they mean not only the online 
trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and 
energy  trading, whether online or otherwise.  Just wanted to pass this on so 
those involved in the issue understand that interest coming from the Hill is 
broader than the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of 
understanding of the benefits of what we do in this area.  Thanks.

Here are some bullets briefly describing the FERC audit high points.  I think the scope is "right on the money" and the timing is reasonably good also.  The text of the audit solicitation follows the bullets.  I've made contact with Andy Sakallaris, head of FERC procurement, to attend the pre-bid conference next Tuesday (assuming it is held, since expressions of interest thus far have been from CA based firms unwilling to make the trip to DC).  Ray

Audit description-  FERC seeks to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements in California markets; accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO will be performed to determine any areas in which the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its responsibilities in operating the transmission system under its control and administering real-time energy markets.

Scope- Provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its FERC tariff and determine whether the CAISO's operations are adequately transparent to market participants.

Audit period- 10/1/00-10/1/01

Deliverables timing- Draft report due on January 9, 2002; final report due January 16, 2002.

Audit schedule-  Begins on November 1, 2001, and ends no later than January 4, 2002.

Pre-proposal conference- A conference is scheduled for prospective offerors at FERC next Tuesday; FERC will give a brief explanation of the requirements and clarify any questions asked.

DUE 102601
POC Charlotte Handley, 202-219-1156 or Andrew Sakallaris,202-219-1150
DESC: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial
  items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6,
  as supplemented with additional information included in this
  notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;
  proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will
  not be issued. FERC02RMT22071 is issued as a request for proposal
  and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC
  97-27. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number
  561. Statement of Work: I. BACKGROUND. The California electricity
  market has experienced great stress from Summer 2000 to Summer
  2001, with demand outstripping supply, wholesale prices rising
  dramatically, and key market participants becoming financially
  unstable. As a result, the California Independent System Operator,
  Inc. (CAISO), which operates the electricity transmission grid
  throughout most of California, was forced to adapt to rapidly
  changing circumstances. During all of this, the CAISO worked
  hard to ensure system reliability. Under the Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission's market mitigation plan, wholesale prices
  stabilized in California in Summer 2001. The Commission seeks
  to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements
  in California markets, including improvements to help the CAISO
  in effectively performing its increasing responsibilities.
  Accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO
  will be performed to determine the areas, if any, in which
  the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its
  responsibilities in operating the transmission system under
  its control and administering certain real-time energy markets.
  II. SCOPE OF WORK. The Independent Public Accounting (Contractor)
  firm shall perform an operational audit of the CAISO processes,
  practices, and procedures in accordance with Generally Accepted
  Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). The Contractor shall
  provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its
  Commission tariff (procedures and tariff can be found at www.caiso.com).
  The Contractor shall ascertain whether the CAISO's operations
  are adequately transparent to market participants. To the extent
  possible, the Contractor shall also ascertain whether the CAISO's
  procedures and operations are consistent with the most effective
  business practice. III. AUDIT PERIOD. The audit of the CAISO
  shall cover the period commencing October 1, 2000, through
  October 1, 2001. IV. DELIVERABLES. The contractor must provide
  the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with a draft
  and final report detailing the findings, operating deficiencies
  and/or major observations and recommendations. These reports
  and other deliverables must be provided to the COR by the close
  of business on the following dates: 1) Draft Report - January
  9, 2002 2) Final Report - January 16, 2002. V. SCHEDULE. The
  operational audit will commence on November 1, 2001, and it
  must be completed no later than January 4, 2002. The contractor
  shall meet with the COR to discuss the audit no later than
  November 6, 2001. The contractor must provide the Commission
  with an operational audit plan no later than November 14, 2001.
  A detailed operational audit plan will be submitted to the
  COR for review, feedback, and approval. The COR or designated
  representative will review the plan. VI. Working Papers. The
  contractor shall prepare and provide a copy of work papers
  in accordance with GAGAS. All work papers shall include the
  purpose, sources of information, the procedures performed,
  results thereof, and conclusions as appropriate for the planning,
  internal control, compliance, and substantive testing phases.
  For all findings, work papers shall clearly show the condition
  or problem, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendation for
  improvement. All working papers shall be cross-referenced to
  audit programs, summaries, and final audit report. These documents
  will become the property of the Commission. During the course
  of the audit or upon completion of the audit work, the Contractor's
  audit report and work papers shall be subject to access and
  review by the Commission. A preproposal conference is scheduled
  for prospective offerors at FERC on Tuesday, October 16, 2001,
  at 10:00 am at 888 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426,
  Room 3M-3. FERC will give a brief explanation of the requirements
  and clarify any questions asked. Questions submitted in advance
  to A. Sakallaris (andrew.sakallaris@ferc.fed.us) is appreciated
  and preferable. Contractual, technical, and legal representatives
  will be on hand to answer any questions. Bring no more than
  three representatives and E-mail or phone A. Sakallaris, 202-219-1150
  to indicate the number and names of individuals attending.
  If unable to attend, E-Mail A. Sakallaris and provide the point
  of contact's mailing and E-mail address and FERC will arrange
  to deliver any additional information that may become available
  as a result of the pre-proposal conference. All offerors and
  subcontractors will complete and submit with their proposals,
  either the Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) representation
  or the OCI disclosure (not both). Complete and submit the OCI
  Questionnaire. Request OCI information from A. Sakallaris.
  See DOE clauses 952.209-8 OCI-Disclosure and 952.209-72 OCI.
  Same/similar language will be incorporated into the resultant
  contract. Period of Performance: From approximately November

  to Offerors-Commercial (Oct 2000), applies. Addendum to FAR
  52.212-1 SUBPARAGRAPH (b) Reply by e- mail the proposal to
  FERC, ATTN: C. Handley, Division of Procurement, FA-12, 888
  First St, NE, Wash DC 20426, e-mail: charlotte.handley@ferc.fed.us.
  It is our intent to evaluate based on initial proposals. Offerors
  shall submit five copies of their price and technical proposal,
  signed by an official authorized to bind the offeror, at the
  above address no later than 2:00 PM local time, Friday, October
  26, 2001. Price Proposal: Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 SUBPARAGRAPH
  (b)(6): The price proposal shall be completely separate from
  the technical proposal. Offerors must breakout pricing by month
  and provide (1) labor categories (2) corresponding firm-fixed-price,
  fully loaded labor rates (3) proposed number of hours estimated
  for each labor category (4) Other Direct Costs as applicable
  (subcontractor and travel). Supporting details shall also be
  provided as appropriate (e.g., travel destinations, number
  of trips, computer time, discounts offered (excluding prompt
  payment)). Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 SUBPARAGRAPH (c) The offeror
  agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 calendar
  days. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan
  1999), applies. Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 SUBPARAGRAPH, (a)
  Technical Proposal: Past Performance (30 points). Ensure that
  the company names, points of contact and phone numbers are
  current. The Offeror and each subcontractor proposed must each
  select three references to complete a "Contractor Past-Performance
  Evaluation." All areas of the sheet must be filled in. If an
  answer to a specific question is not provided, the applicable
  area must be annotated with the reason why (e.g. "Reference
  failed to provide an answer"). Higher scores will be assigned
  for contracts that are at least similar in size and complexity.
  FERC may obtain and evaluate information from sources other
  than those provided by the offeror. FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv) states
  "In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past
  performance or for whom information on past performance is
  not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or
  unfavorably on past performance." For the purposes of this
  evaluation not being evaluated favorably or unfavorably means
  the offeror will receive a rating of "good or acceptable" on
  company past performance. To obtain a copy of the past performance
  form to be completed by the Offeror's references, request from
  A. Sakallaris by email. The Offeror will be responsible and
  ensure that the references submit or reply by e-mail their
  completed response to C. Handley, located at the above address
  by 2:00 PM local time, October 26, 2001. Offerors should also
  notify the references that FERC may be contacting them regarding
  the past performance information. Prior Audit Experience (25
  points). The offeror must cover in its proposal the extent
  of prior related experience in electric bulk power markets,
  and the ability to effectively and efficiently conduct this
  operational audit in accordance with GAGAS. The proposal must
  include previous and/or current experience, within the last
  3 years, where the offeror has performed audits similar in
  terms of size and complexity of this requirement. Higher scores
  will be assigned to those offerors who have demonstrated successful
  experience in electric bulk power markets within the last three
  years. To be acceptable, the services must have been satisfactorily
  performed and at least similar in terms of size and complexity
  to the work required under this contract. Understanding the
  Statement of Work (20 points). The proposal must clearly demonstrate
  in sufficient and precise detail the offeror's expertise in
  understanding and analyzing independent system operator tariffs,
  market operations and services, and transmission issues. The
  offeror must describe its ability to perform a comprehensive
  and thorough analysis of the electric bulk power market operated
  by the CAISO. Higher scores will be assigned to those offerors
  who demonstrate an understanding and greater knowledge of independent
  system operator tariffs, market operations and services, and
  transmission issues. Higher scores will also be assigned to
  offerors who demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of bulk
  power markets like those operated by the CAISO. Audit Methodology
  and Quality Control (15 points). The technical proposal must
  include the audit methodology and must address each phase of
  the audit. The proposal must identify specific aspects of each
  phase and explain how each phase/aspect is related. The offeror
  must include estimated completion times for each phase of the
  audit and address critical completion dates. The technical
  proposal must describe the audit approach to documenting systems
  and internal controls, and effective procedures, including
  consideration of risk and materiality, to determine the extent
  of audit testing. Quality control is an important part of the
  technical proposal. The proposal must demonstrate the offeror's
  internal quality control procedures. The proposal must include
  a copy of the firm's latest peer review report, comments, and
  the response to the peer review report. Higher scores will
  be assigned to those offerors who demonstrate and offer a sound,
  valid, effective, and innovative audit methodology that reflects
  an understanding of the statement of work. "Valid" entails
  the use of techniques that are known to be feasible with respect
  to the area addressed; "Effective" refers to the workability
  and appropriateness of the methodology. "Innovative" means
  the development and application of a novel, yet valid technique
  that will increase the effectiveness of the approach. Higher
  scores will be assigned to offerors who demonstrate sound and
  effective internal quality control procedures. Professional
  Qualifications (10 points). The offeror must describe in its
  proposal: 1) the professional qualifications of the staff that
  will be assigned to this contract and 2) demonstrate that it
  has sufficient resources to perform the audit and qualified
  staff to perform critical tasks necessary to support the audit.
  The written response must also include the following information
  for all staff participating on the audit: Labor Category (i.e.,
  Partner, Manager, etc.); CPA certification date (if applicable);
  Other applicable certification(s); Total years of audit and/or
  other experience; Advance degree(s) obtained; and Total years
  employed by the offeror. Higher scores will be based on offeror's
  educational background, recent work experience, and certifications
  obtain by their staff. In particular, higher scores will be
  given to those who offer recent experience with independent
  system operator tariffs, market operations and services, transmission
  issues, and bulk power markets like those operated by the CAISO.
  Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 SUBPARAGRAPH (a). Technical and past
  performance, when combined, are more important than price.
  However, award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal
  is determined to best meet the needs of the Government after
  consideration of all factors i.e., provides the "best value."
  "Best value," for the purpose of the contract is defined as
  the procurement process that results in the most advantageous
  acquisition decision for the Government and is performed through
  an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between technical
  and price factors. Include a completed copy of Provision at

Rick,

I am sending you the presentation that was circulated in Steve's meeting last 
Monday, by Jim. This was initiated in a California Conference call when news 
about prices going down first came to be known. Alan drew the very first cut, 
but then I had subsequently changed it quite a bit after getting feedback 
from Tom Briggs, Alan, Jim Steffes, paul Kaufman, Linda Robertson and others.

A few slides from this presentation were then used by Steve for his Madrid 
visit. Mark  Palmer circulated only the graphs of prices going down to the 
press, after he attended Steve's meeting.

I thought of updating you on the same

Regards
Ban

Gang:

The final letter and document will be given to the Speaker shortly.  As you
may know, TURN ultimately decided not to participate.  Also, late last week
the Utility Workers had an elected change of leadership and there was not
enough time to bring the new officers up to speed by our deadline.

The Speaker plans on using our product to simultaneously encourage the PUC
not to close the door on direct access and, if necessary, convince the
Legislature to pass this year a meaningful direct access program (if the PUC
goes south on us).  Also, I believe he hopes that our work will help
convince the Legislature to move to restore SCE to financial stability - and
to do so rapidly.

This last month has been very interesting to me - "oddly satisfying" is how
I described it, even if most of you did object to the phrasing - and I
appreciate the opportunity of working with you.  For whatever reasons, there
is nothing like an intractable social and political problems to get me
interested.  Thanks very much for participating.

Phil

As Mike Day has indicated, we are 99% sure the CPUC will bifurcate the PX 
credit payment and DA suspension issues, and vote only on DA suspension on 
Thursday.  This gives more time to work on a SCE PX credit stipulation.

		 Subject: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE - CPUC Decision

Harry & Sue --

Please work with Mike Day on Monday am to develop the following -

1. Outline of a proposed SCE - Enron - WPTF Stipulation that resolves SCE's 
request for suspension of payment of PX Credit.
2. Talking points for Jeff Skilling to call Bryson to discuss.

Get these to Skilling through Rick early Monday so that he can call.  
Skilling is going to try and convince SCE to settle and not let the CPUC 
decide this issue.

I know it's a long-shot on getting a deal done and before the CPUC on 
Wednesday, but this may be our last best hope to hold this element of the 
Proposed Decision.

Call me on Monday am to discuss (I'll be in DC).

Thanks,

Jim

> Governor  Davis' Lead Bond Counsel Holds Teleconference Today with
> Financial Analysts: Summary
> 
> The host of the teleconference was Mr. Joseph Fichera, CEO of Saber
> Partners (serving as Governor's independent Bond Counsel)
> 
> Mr. Fichera's goal appeared to be to calm the financial markets as the
> Governor is hoping under a best case scenario to put the bonds out to
> market sometime in June.  Fichera told me yesterday that he does these
> calls on an "as needed" basis.  There appeared to be some concern that the
> "media is getting ahead of the story" and the inference could be made that
> this is causing problems for the Governor's MOU legislation (which they
> also said they hope to have signed by June) and perhaps for the emerging
> "Plan B" as well.  
> 
> A replay of this teleconference is available at www.energyinfo.ca.gov.ca
> 
> Mr. Fichera broke down his statement into the following sections:
> 
> California State Senate: Pieces of Governor's MOU legislation moving in
> separate committees; in the Senate this is positive for moving it forward.
> 
> Assembly Plan B Group: Assemblymembers Keeley, Dutra and Nation are
> working together and have good ideas to move the Governor's MOU
> legislation through.  Fichera said that the Governor's office is meeting
> with both parties but the plan is still in the  formative stages.  He
> added that they still have the Senate to deal with and no movement on the
> proposal is imminent.  They are hopeful that it will be "moving toward
> resolution in a week or two."
> 
> Generators: Fichera stated that since the Governor's meeting with the
> generators, a subgroup has agreed to continue to meet with Governor's
> staff and advisors to resolve the issues.  He stated that the issue of
> litigation and investigations by the AG's office is "off the table" for
> discussion and that topics of discussion are limited to supply issues and
> managing the coming summer.
> 
> QFs: Governor's team has facilitated 5 days of discussions with SCE and
> QFs over past two weeks; most QFs are represented at these negotiations.
> They continue to discuss the back payments owed and lower prices going
> forward to give pricing stability to CDWR and the market.  Their hope is
> that due to negotiations, the QFS will all be fully available to the
> market this summer.
> 
> PGE:  They see the bankruptcy judge's refusal to allow certain QFs to get
> out of their contracts as a positive development. 
> 
> QFs on-line: There are currently 700 MWs off-line; this is better than
> their model anticipated for May.  They expect more than 90%
> on-line by June.  Last month 1700 QF MWs off-line; Fichera explained that
> standard QF contracts have severe penalties if not on by June 1 during
> peaks but that they are allowed to be off during off-peak hours.  He added
> that they are still trying to resolve their issues.
> 
> Key aspects of budget plan (by this I believe he meant energy financing,
> not the annual budget):  conservation and contracts
> 
> Conservation: They built in a 4% reduction in demand and 3% reduction for
> price elasticity--conservatively projecting  7% in conservation.  He
> stated the we saw 9% conservation in March and April, "so we think our
> model is conservative."  Fichera added that the new electricity rates go
> out in June and they expect that this will cause a "good reaction" due to
> price signals and demand reduction.
> 
> They also built in 2% in natural load growth to their projections as well
> to further ensure a conservative estimate.
> 
> Energy Costs: Projected ($1.78 billion) vs. actual ($1.80 billion) equals
> a variance of 1.4%
> 
> May Energy Costs:  As of May 6th, right on budget target, with a variance
> of less than a half percent
> 
> Contracts:  Fichera stated that DWR continues to execute new contracts and
> reduce the net short exposure in the spot market.  He added that 10-20% of
> necessary contracts are not yet executed, but rather in the agreement in
> principal stage.  He released the following stats:
> 
> Needed executed contracts completed (these percentages must refer to
> projected load accounted for): 43% for May, 67% for June, 48% for July,
> 42% for August
> 
> When agreements in principle added in: 73% for June, 67% for July, 60% for
> August:
> 
> Questions from analysts:
> 
> Have you built-in an assumption that QFs will be able to opt out of
> contracts?  "No, we do not because we are fighting the opt-out positions.
> The bankruptcy judge refused to allow this and the AG is probably going to
> be involved to stop that.  A few hundred MWs have gone into the market.
> We are aware of this issue, which is why we're pushing the MOUs--this
> litigation would stop if we get an agreement on the MOU because the back
> payment issue would be settled."
> 
> Timing with SDG&E,  where are you on MOU or Agreement in Principle?  We
> have to constantly reevaluate our negotiations   due to other decisions
> {happening simultaneously around us].  We are resuming face to face
> negotiations on Monday and we are still resolved to reach an agreement.
> There is no drop dead date.
> 
> Generators working group? We're discussing DWR credit issues, summer,
> support for MOU--the generators have issues with outstanding payments due.
> The Governor expects them to provide haircut re: those payments and that's
> part of discussion.
> 
> QF resolution: will gas QFs be released from contracts?  We don't know
> what PG&E is going to do but they could do that-- release at any time--no
> indications yet--haven't affirmed all the contracts yet.  We want to avoid
> this in the SCE situation.  There are a lot of overlapping QFs that supply
> both utilities.  We are trying to set a standard as to what we are looking
> for.
> 
> Bond issue timing? The current plan, assuming there is no further action
> by the legislature, is to close sales 91 days after bond sales, on Aug.
> 14.  We have sufficient cash to carry us through this period.  We are
> making a bridge loan from the General Fund.  In June we see improved
> revenue stream from ISO; rate increases will also improve cash stream.
> 
> Can you give us any prices on new contracts?  Not on new contracts, we are
> resisting for market reasons giving out individual prices for individual
> contracts.  Our website has aggregated average prices for contracts signed
> so far.
> 
> Where is the legislature?  Legislators want to see sharing of the pain--so
> far the focus has been mostly on generators.  The undercollection is
> associated so far with the generators, legislators are beginning to see
> that only about 1/3 of the undercollection is tied to generators.  So
> should QFs and commercial banks share the pain?  Some think some are less
> guilty than others.  We can only deal with Edison.  The media has gotten a
> little ahead of the process, this is going to take longer than a few
> weeks.  
> 
> Handicap?  Lead horse?  The Assembly is more organized and focused right
> now on enhancements and changes to the Governor's  plan; the Senate is not
> as organized, though we have engaged with Senator Burton--we met with him
> 3 times this week.  And the Senate Majority leader has sponsored a bill to
> implement the Governor's plan.
> 
> If QFs freed up from contracts under bankruptcy or otherwise released from
> contracts--how does this affect your financial plans?  "I think it would
> change it dramatically.  It would be a budget busting event."  That's why
> we're resisting in court and pushing the MOU and hope that the legislature
> sees why bankruptcy is not a viable solution.
> 
> Does this need to be solved before bond issue?  The combination of AB1x

CONFIDENTIAL -- FERC SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS

I have proposed quite a few changes and additions to the list.  I also ask 
some questions re some of the items listed. I added a section on Retail 
Reforms -- we cannot settle with the state unless we settle everything -- 
otherwise we know the outcome to expect.

regarding your question on hourly day ahead markets -- I assume you're 
referring to the energy market that the PX used to run, because the CAISO 
already has day-ahead markets for congestion and ancillary services.  I 
discussed this proposal with Tim in March because the ISO's filing at FERC 
for market reforms had the ISO setting up such a market -- essentially 
putting the former PX inside the ISO (and for all you historians, finally 
creating the dream of POOLCO for California).  Tim asked us to oppose that 
proposal -- his view at the time was that we didn;t want the ISO running 
energY markets, because private third parties could do a much better job of 
that.  So, we opposed that in our filings commenting on the ISO's proposal in 
March.

I'll be in the office Wednesday (Oops! Today).  Can we discuss this list and 
where we are headed?

For your review/comment.  We are potentially submitting these points into 
settlement discussions.  Do we want to propose that the CAISO develop the 
systems to implement hourly day ahead markets?  Is this ok with Jeff 
Richter?  Ray

Subject: Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us
 What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

SBX 28 (Sher), related to expedited siting, passed out of both houses
today and was sent to Governor Davis.  The bill was amended to remove
the unemployment provisions which the Chamber and Manufacturers objected
to.  Some of the key provisions of the bill are as follows:

Expedites various CEC procedures for siting power plants;

Limits to 45 days and 100 days, until January 1, 2004, a local
jurisdiction's time for initial review and final review, respectively,
of an application submitted to the CEC;

Requires CEC to certify repowering projects within 180 days;

Extends from August 1, 2001 to December 31, 2002, the date by which
temporary "peaker" power plants must be in
service so as to qualify for the four-month siting process.

Requires ARB to develop expedited programs for retrofitting and
identifying and banking of emission credits;

Requires air districts to adopt an expedited program for permitting of
standby or distributed generation facilities and natural gas
transmission facilities;

Authorizes payment to air districts of mitigation fees for a new power
plant in lieu of obtaining actual emissions offsets, when the owner or
operator of the plant has shown that offsets are not available;

Waives conditionally, for a period of 10 years, standby charges imposed
by electrical corporations on customers who have installed non-gas-fired
distributed generation equipment five megawatts or smaller that commence
operation by September 1, 2002.  Provides that the waiver for gas-fired
units shall only apply until June 1, 2006.

Permits a gas corporation, until June 1, 2002, to exercise the power of
eminent domain to condemn any property for the purpose of competing with
another entity  in the offering of natural gas and services related to
natural gas.  Additionally, until June 1, 2002, prohibits CPUC from
making a finding on a petition or complaint  filed pursuant to Section
625 of the Public Utilities Code, and requires CPUC to dismiss the
petition or complaint.

Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt 
Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief
Thursday, May 31, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/31/M
N231235.DTL 
Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern 
California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at 
the expense of its biggest customers. 
The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial 
customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion 
back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users 
would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt. 
Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but 
supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and 
should shoulder the costs it created. 
"We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these 
problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any 
problems," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). 
Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put 
Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help 
restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. 
Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP 
lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt. 
The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into "core" and 
"noncore" users. 
SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS
Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core 
users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would 
be those using more than 500 kilowatts. 
Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. 
But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy. 
Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- 
term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar 
panels, on contract with the utility. 
That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of 
the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of 
electricity. 
Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to 
buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to 
make themselves energy self-sufficient. 
The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy 
customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. 
During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users 
would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would 
shift exclusively to the big users. 
Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be 
given what is called "direct access" to generators so they can negotiate 
cheaper rates. 
Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users 
because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. 
Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so. 
EDISON 'ENCOURAGED'
Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out 
details of the plan. 
A spokesman for Edison said he was "encouraged" by the talks. 
"I haven't seen a finished product or a plan," said Bob Foster, a senior vice 
president with Edison. "They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and 
trying to find a solution." 
Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there 
is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. 
"We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will 
experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years," said D.J. Smith, a 
lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. 
"When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another 
potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy," 
Smith said. 
Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association: "What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying 
the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. 
They don't want voters to pay because they vote." 
CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business 
interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto 
residential and smaller commercial customers. 
"I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public 
Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big 
business end up costing more for residential and small businesses," 
Rosenfield said. 
The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of 
the transmission system that loops electricity around the state. 
Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that 
for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. 
Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state 
purchase of transmission lines. 
In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the 
transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. 
In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to 
either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, 
for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

Attached, please find a mocked up version of SBX2 27 (Bowen), regarding
direct access, as it is proposed to be amended in the Senate
Appropriations Committee today. A new element to this bill would require
ESPs to pay a reinstatement fee to DWR if they return customers to an
IOU.

Marty - the latest -

2 Direct Access bills (Bowen, Kelly) are still on the table.  Have not 
changed much since my earlier e-mail to you, except that Bowen bill now 
includes a fee to the alternate provider when a customer is "involuntarily 
returned" to the utility.  Language is attached.

 - SB 27xx - mockup.doc

Right now, this legislation is awaiting the outcome of negotiations involving 
SCE and other parties (Jeff Dasovich is our rep).  Speaker Hertzberg and 
Senator Burton both have endorsed these negotiations and promised to support 
agreements the parties reach.   Jeff tells me this morning they are getting 
close to agreement on core/non-core and direct access issues but there are 
still major stumbling blocks,  mostly surrounding the going forward DWR costs 
and contracts, and the issuance of bonds to pay for them.  The bond guys see 
direct access as possible undermining the bonds.  If or once agreement is 
reached, the expectation is that enabling legislation would be crafted that 
would apply California-wide.

The general structure in the SCE discussion is this -
By Jan 1, '03, 500 kW+ customers decide to go to market or stay with utility 
for a long (5 yrs+) period.  Re-entry from market would be with up to 12 
month notice and could require customer to pay spot market price under 
utility default.   20-500 kw customers would have voluntary direct access.  
Under 20 kw customers would have green-only voluntary direct access.   
Recovery for past undercollections is being negotiated, but will likely 
require large customers (20 kw+)  to pay a disproportionate share of the 
costs.

This may be less than definitive, but as usual, the situation is fluid.   
Marty and Jeremy, are you available for a Wednesday morning call with Jeff 
Dasovich? 

Also, just in case you didn't hear, the Commission is scheduled to vote on 
Thursday the 14th on an order that would suspend direct access under the 
AB1x.  The expectation is that the vote will be delayed.  Best information 
says there are not enough votes to approve direct access suspension.

Harry (or anyone else that might know),
Can you help me understand what has gone on in the last week re:

1)  definitive view of exit fees and how they will be administered.  What is 
the probability of one proposed approach vs. others?

2) definitive view of core / non core decisions?  when are they coming?  How 
might they influence our actions with the existing contracts.  Probability of 
one proposal passing  and when?

Guys, I assume that we are managing all new and old California contracts with 
this potential issue in mind.  This plus the exit fees could be a significant 
issue.   Let me know if we need a broader discussion.

Marty - here are two versions of direct access legislation that will get some 
attention next week.  The first is the current version of the Bowen bill. The 
second is a retail coalition bill that will be introduced next week.  Primary 
differences are this:

The Bowen bill gives more latitude to the PUC to determine whether retail 
customers can participate in direct access.  The Coalition bill gives a much 
more prescriptive description on how the exit fee should be calculated.

In the Coalition bill, there are two components to the exit fee:
a backward looking part to cover DWR costs since Jan 17
a forward looking part to cover unavoidable future costs, which does not 
apply if 
  - for res and small commercial customers, DA load is less than 5% of total 
res and small commercial load
  - for large customers, total DA load is less than the "net short"
  - for self gen customers, the customer has given 180 days prior notification

Both have a re-entry fee for return to utility service.

Harry,
Thanks. 
Can you get me whatever has been written concerning the proposed exit fees 
for customers that contemplate using a direct access provider in the future?

fyi... editorial in today's LA Daily News:


Lockyer lockdown 


Not wanting to be outdone by Gov. Gray Davis, California Attorney General 
Bill Lockyer recently tried his hand at Sacramento's new favorite game: 
demonizing power generators. 
Elaborating on his plan to file criminal charges against energy officials, 
Lockyer singled out Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay for imprudent remarks. 
"I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell," Lockyer told The 
Wall Street Journal, "that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi 
my name is Spike, honey."' 
Get it? 
Spike would proceed to rape, maul and otherwise abuse Lay. 
Real funny, isn't it? 
Rape is widely considered commonplace in prison, and for good reason. Human 
Rights Watch estimates that as many 140,000 inmates have been raped in 
penitentiaries nationwide. 
In a recent study, the organization documented instances of sexual slavery 
taking place in prisons in six different states -- including California. 
That should be a serious concern for the state's top law-enforcement official 
-- not a laughing matter. 
Lockyer might have only been kidding, but his joke contains a tacit admission 
that rape is rampant in the state prison system. It suggests that he thinks 
this illegal and unconstitutional horror might, on occasion, serve as just 
punishment for some. 
Perhaps that's why prison officials -- in California and elsewhere -- have 
done so little to contain the problem. 
But their neglect comes at society's expense. Sexual abuse in American 
prisons hardens prisoners and makes them more dangerous upon their release. 
Rather than rehabilitating criminals, dangerous prisons reinforce their sense 
of lawlessness. 
We're willing to write off Lockyer's statement as merely thoughtless and 
unfunny, but we doubt that others will be quick to let him off so lightly. 
It's hard to imagine that a lawyer representing a raped inmate -- or the 
entire class of raped inmates -- would be quite so forgiving. 
In a lawsuit against the state corrections system, a quote from the attorney 
general making light of rampant sexual violence in state prisons could be 
damning. 
As the state's top attorney, Lockyer should know better than to serve up 
political rhetoric that could open up his clients -- the taxpayers -- to 
millions of dollars in legal penalties. 
His reckless words and callous attitude do little to inspire public 
confidence.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? Senator Keeley Spearheads a New "Plan B"
? State to Offer Little Aid in PG&E Bankruptcy

Keeley's Collective "Plan B"
Sources report that additional details for the Plan B have just been ironed 
out on the Assembly side.  The Assembly is working to announce a plan "as 
soon as possible"; this announcement could come this afternoon.  If it is not 
this afternoon, it will be later this week.   Sources Report the Republicans 
were working with Keeley, but then felt shut out of the process, so they 
developed a plan of their own (a lightly publicized point last week).  
However, sources believe that the Plan B is very likely to have enough 
Republican support to pass the Assembly.  The Senate will likely be a much 
tougher fight, but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will 
be able to stop it.  The Senate appears likely to broaden the base of people 
who would have to pay the dedicated rate component, which will be unpopular.  
Borrowing from elements of the Joe Nation and Florez "Plan B's," Keeley's new 
plan is said to:
? Set up a dedicated rate component for SoCal to deal with part of their 
undercollect.  This dedicated rate component would apply more to "high-end 
customers."  Where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who 
would not is still subject to negotiation.  The size of the dedicated rate 
component is also subject to negotiation.  SoCal has suggested $3M for 10 to 
12 years.  Note, sources report that at this time, a dedicated rate component 
for SoCal to pay for power going forward is NOT included in the Plan B that 
will be announced.  The Assembly is not certain whether this additional 
dedicated rate component will be needed.  If the bond issuance is enough to 
cover the cost of power purchases, no dedicated rate component for forward 
purchases will be needed.  By 2003 and 2004, enough additional generation 
should be online that power prices should be low.  Therefore, the key 
question becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002?  If the cost of 
power is high, rates may have to be increased at that time for SoCal to 
continue operating.
? The state would make a secured loan (secured against the transmission 
assets) to SoCal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect.  This loan 
would be paid back by SoCal granting the government a lower rate of return on 
the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years.  This provides an 
incentive for SoCal to sell its transmission system to the state, since it 
would not be making as much money from the system.  Were this to happen, the 
value would be credited toward the loan.
? In return, the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the 
filed rate doctrine case.  Also, SoCal would reduce the price of native power 
generation.  Finally, business customers (including those that would have to 
pay the dedicated rate component) would have the right to apply for direct 
access to power.
If this plan is passed, (better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier) the 
constitutional challenge from Michael Sturmwasser is still likely to go 
forward.  This is because Sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that 
the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay SoCal's undercollect.  
Sources believe it is likely that SoCal will eventually sell its transmission 
assets to the state if this plan is passed.  Therefore these assets would 
become municipal, making the reduction in the PUC's authority constitutional.

Legislature Leaves PG&E to Throws of Bankruptcy
Today, there have been discussions concerning PG&E regarding "Plan B" and the 
legislature.   Currently, the legislature is NOT considering offering 
Keeley's "Plan B" solution to PG&E.  If the Plan B mentioned above passes the 
Senate, it is more likely that the state will purchase PG&E out of 
bankruptcy.  Both the Assembly and the Senate leadership are talking 
seriously about purchasing PG&E out of bankruptcy, though the Republicans 
remain strongly opposed.  The state then, would likely sell off pieces of 
PG&E (except for the transmission assets, which it would retain).

Much Calif Power Price Gouging Beyond FERC's Reach -ISO    
Updated: Monday, June 25, 2001 06:59 PM ET   Email this article to a friend! 
 Printer-friendly version  


By Jason Leopold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to 
order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis 
claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 
2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 

Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
System Operator.  
   
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 

Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
expects. 

Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal, 
and that is to bring back $9 billion." 

Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 

David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
corporate energy suppliers. 

But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
by FERC. 

Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 

State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky 
calculations." 

To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
expected under competitive market conditions. 

The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
air-quality rules. 

The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 

The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power 
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 

The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
documents. 

The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
amounts between May 2000 and February:

You were quite right on the topic of gas prices in California. I looked
through some articles I have been collecting that make reference to an
investigation by the FERC into alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp
in the context of the price basis between San Juan and Topock. You probably
know all this already, but I attach an article that was in the FT yesterday.

Sabine.

I took a call from a reporter this morning about pricing info for May 9 (the 
reporter wants to make the point that the state overpaid for its contracts).  
I got the following info from Bob Badeer:

May 9 -- prices at SP15 (location north of LA-south, but excluding LA) for 
July forward -- flat price, 7/24
 5-year: $75/MWh
 10-year: $63

today (6/28):
 5-year: $42
 10-year: $41

Given that we are already well into the Summer of '01, it now appears that 
further CDWR contracting will only lock CA into high prices.  The original 
idea was that CDWR could buy power at $80/mwh and ensure that retail rates 
wouldn't go higher.  Neither of these concepts have held true.

I think that Enron needs to consider actively oppossing any further 
contracting and a bond issuance in light of the potential harm that CDWR will 
do.  First, the prices they are getting won't be great for customers.  
Second, with the "new" stranded costs that will be created, direct access in 
the future won't have a chance.

Appreciate everyone's thoughts?

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West 
Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the 
above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their 
analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the 
agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state 
in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their 
nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we 
excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas 
portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  
These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  
Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The 
spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative 
"mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  
Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

Guys and Gals --

Commercial wants our opinion (in fact they want us to contact the CPUC and 
legislative members) to gauge the "true" meaning of the DA bypass of the 
3c/kwh Surcharge.  This question basically has arisen because there is a 
customer that we may not re-DASR if the Surcharge bypass extends in 
perpetuity (or if at least is there a Window of Opportunity that keeps 
customers from paying).  Put in other words, would anyone give us a "free 
pass" if we move load to DA right now and promise to keep them there with no 
ability to return to electric utility service?

My current analysis looks something like this --

The term "Surcharge" is only applicable until the end of the AB1890 rate 
freeze (which will end no later than March.1.02 and may end earlier if (a) 
federal court finds in PG&E/SCE favor or (b) California legislature mandates 
an earlier end-date.  Surcharge is a "term of art" to get around the problems 
of the AB1890 rate freeze.
At the end of the AB1890 rate freeze, it is my understanding that the CPUC 
will modify fully the rate structure and level to ensure full cost recovery 
on a going forward basis (therefore Utility Retained Generation, QF expense, 
CDWR current expenses (both energy purchase and financing costs will be 
included).
Other outstanding costs will include (1) Utility Undercollection from May.00 
until when no additional CA-ISO costs are applied) and (2) CDWR costs 
beginning Jan.17.01 until the end of AB1890 rate freeze new rates.
Understanding how these costs will be recovered and by whom will most likely 
(70%) be decided by the Legislature with some decision-making by the CPUC.
Utility Undercollection Bypass - 25%
CDWR Jan.17.01 thru AB1890 end Bypass - 80% for people who never were on 
Utility Service, 10% for people who used Utility Service post Jan.17.01
CDWR Net Unavoidable Bypass - 10% for people who used Utility Service post 
Jan.17.01, 80% for others.

LEGISLATION IMPACTING THIS DECISION

There are three key direct access bills being considered (the Bowen bill - 
SB2x27, the Kelley bill - AB2x42, and the Battin bill - SB2x??).

The Bowen bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in AB1x1 and 
replace it with the following (1) if a customer has not bought from an 
electric utility on or after Jan.17.01 there are no charges [except there may 
be an entrance fee to use the electric utility going forward] and (2) if a 
customer wants to switch from an electric utility to an ESP they must pay "to 
the department any uncollected amounts equivalent to the department's net 
unavoidable cost of power procurement, including any financing costs, 
attributable to that customer" to ensure the satisfaction of any power 
purchase obligation or bond obligation to serve "that customer".  The 
recovery period shall be coincident with the terms of bonds issued to finance 
the purchases.  The CPUC has 90 days from the effective date to notify 
customers of their obligations.  

The Kelley bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in AB1x1 and 
replace it with the following (1) if a customer has not bought from an 
electric utility on or after Jan.17.01 there are no charges, (2) every 
customer is allowed to buy from an ESP a % of their load equal to the amount 
served by Utility Retained Generation (not CDWR purchases) with no charges, 
(3) after the effective date, any customer that buys from the electric 
utility and wants to switch must pay "to ensure satisfaction of any power 
purchase obligation or bond obligation incurred by the department" with the 
following constraints - (a) for res and small commercial customers, if DA 
load is less than load growth or (b) to self gen customers, if the customer 
has given 180 days prior notification or (c) if the customer has given DWR 12 
months' advance written notice (then only a fee equal to 12 months 
unavoidable costs).  The CPUC has 30 days from the effective date to notify 
customers of their obligations.

The Battin bill would ... still reviewing

CPUC DECISIONS IMPACTING THIS

May 5 Order - DA doesn't pay current DWR expenses.  Good for bypass of these 
costs.

Agreed.  My initial thoughts --

1. More Government isn't the answer.  If this proves anything, it is that 
Government is the wrong party to manage consumer's energy price risk.  

2. This is a 10 year hangover.  The total bill = $### billion.  

3. Direct Access is a better solution for California.  Let businesses manage 
their own needs, rather than a small public agency never designed to take on 
this task.

4. Too much, too late.  CDWR should have been buying to manage the cost for 
2001, not worrying about 2007.  Any contract that starts after Sept 2002 is 
simply not a part of any real solution.

By the way, I think that if pressed, Enron has to be very clear - we are not 
advocating abrogation of contracts.

Jim

P.S. Jennifer will be ready to present something at the call.

All:

One thing to note is that while the DWR contracts are blended with the core, 
the non-core, if our curve come to be true, would enjoy the back end of the 
curve's lower price path.    

We calculated, based on the DWR's figures, the negative mark-to-maket at the 
various points in time:

6/02      $4.2B
12/02    $5.8B
6/03      $7.0B

While our curves differ, this gives an order of magnitute.

Subject: Concept for core/noncore Analysis

OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch 
some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.  Wanted to lay out 
the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest 
in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is 
the analysis that you're already working on:

Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03.
Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 
years).
Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the 
short for the core)
Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts 
the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's 
going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs 
attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date.

Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed.  Thanks.

Best,

FT Energy Article


By Rick Stouffer
rstouffer@ftenergy.com
The electricity supply-demand equation is simple: Match supply to demand an=
d=20
things are dandy. Demand overwhelms supply: build more supply.

Throughout the country, but particularly in California, there is no questio=
n=20
more supply is mandated=01*NIMBY (not in my backyard) be hanged. But what a=
bout=20
the demand side of the issue? What about getting customers involved in the=
=20
solution by allowing them to sell their excess power back into the system?=
=20

'Negawatts' nothing new
Granted, the concept of negawatts is nothing new; it was coined roughly a=
=20
quarter-century ago by the founder of the Boulder-based consulting firm E=
=20
Source: Amory Lovins. Many utilities today use customer curtailment to get=
=20
them through wattage rough spots from time to time.=20

All the existing independent system operators have actively considered=20
demand-side bids at one time or another, according to Richard Rudden,=20
president of the consulting firm R.J. Rudden Associates in Hauppauge, N.Y.=
=20

But what about a negawatt program serving the entire Western Interconnectio=
n?=20
Rather than a supply exchange, aka an independent system operator, put in=
=20
place a "demand exchange" where customers could make a choice: Do I produce=
=20
widgets, run my milling machines, build product or take the power I would=
=20
have used, bid it out and see what happens?=20

Just such a demand exchange within the Western Interconnection is being=20
championed by an unlikely proponent: Reliant Energy Inc.=20

The Houston-based energy giant already has testified in Washington, D.C.,=
=20
concerning the proposal, has had meetings with key Western state government=
=20
leadership and pitched its idea to trade associations and environmental=20
groups.=20

The scorecard: Thus far, no one has laughed, no one has walked away from th=
e=20
conversations=01*no one has said "no," according to Reliant's John H. Stout=
,=20
senior vice president of asset commercialization.=20

"You're taking forced, rotating outages and prioritizing the interruption,=
=20
with the customer (that) can take the outage doing so," said Stout.=20

Much of what Reliant proposes is included in Texas Republican Congressman J=
oe=20
Barton's Electricity Emergency Assistance bill, but no big generator is=20
pushing from the industry side like Reliant.=20

A demand exchange
Like generators, including Reliant, bidding load into the independent syste=
m=20
operator pool, a demand exchange allows retail customers to determine what=
=20
they could spare and bid in a specific load and acceptable price.=20

The negawatt dispatch clearinghouse would develop a bid stack and make it=
=20
available throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC). If a=
=20
particular system needed more power, it would contact the clearinghouse,=20
which would match the least cost set of bids that could be shipped, keeping=
=20
in mind additional transmission charges.=20

Once the bids were identified, the clearinghouse would contact the customer=
=20
and its local control area. The customer would interrupt and the host utili=
ty=20
would move the curtailed megawatts onto an export schedule.=20

One key to the program's success is that no one loses money. The customer=
=20
that gave up its designated electrons would continue to pay its retail=20
supplier for what it didn't actually use, and the customer would receive it=
s=20
bid price, times the megawatts curtailed, minus its regular retail charges,=
=20
plus any payment to the transmission provider.=20

"The key is it gets the incentives right at the margin," said William Hogan=
,=20
a professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.=
=20

Another key to the Reliant-championed negawatt program is that it is not=20
seasonal; it doesn't lock a potential megawatt-shedder into a long-term=20
contract.=20

"You can bid into the market every day," said Stout.=20

"It offers a tremendous advantage in that it allows distributive decisions =
to=20
be made, how much a customer is willing to take for an energy entitlement,"=
=20
said Richard Tabors, president of the Cambridge, Mass.-based energy=20
consulting firm Tabors, Carmanis & Associates.=20
As Tabors points out, customers who sell back into the market obviously are=
=20
doing so to play the margin, to make money. But their efforts also will hav=
e=20
a serious impact on the spot market price.=20

"Every megawatt not consumed is a megawatt which doesn't have to be=20
produced," Tabors reasoned. "That lowers the marginal cost, the spot market=
=20
cost. It really comes down to what (specific megawatts) are worth to someon=
e=20
and not worth to me."=20

Heavy users thrilled
Heavy industrial users already are thrilled with the regional negawatt=20
proposal. "We think it is a well thought-out program. We feel customers hav=
e=20
the right to buy power, they should have the right to sell power and ought =
to=20
be compensated like the generators," said John Anderson, executive director=
=20
of ELCON, the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, which represents larg=
e=20
industrial users from nearly every manufacturing sector.=20

Anderson favors this particular plan because it gives the customer choice=
=01*
sound familiar?=01*allowing it to determine when it shuts down or gives up =
its=20
power.=20

"This is voluntary. You know when you will be shut down and thus you won't=
=20
incur any damages," said Anderson. "Many proposals tell the customer to cut=
=20
usage, but it costs money for industrial users to just shut down. Command a=
nd=20
control proposals treat everyone alike=01*and they're not."=20

Stout said at least two vendors have expressed interest in taking part in t=
he=20
Reliant proposal, with discussions already taking place with Automated Powe=
r=20
Exchange Inc. (APX).=20

"We have had discussions with Reliant; we're in the business of working wit=
h=20
generators," said John Melby, vice president for North American marketing f=
or=20
Santa Clara, Calif.-based APX.=20

According to Melby, APX represents more than half the demand response in th=
e=20
California ISO. He said the company could utilize key computer programs and=
=20
systems previously developed to get the region-wide negawatt program up and=
=20
running.=20

The down side
There could be a number of problems in moving forward with such a large pla=
n.=20
Consultant Tabors, for example, pointed to the White House and the Bush=20
administration's seeming preoccupation with supply.=20

Harvard's Hogan said having the power available when needed was key, while=
=20
Reliant's Stout said the biggest hurdle was that many states prohibit retai=
l=20
customers from selling load back into the wholesale market. An obvious=20
solution to that would be passage of the Barton bill; however, nothing is=
=20
certain in such a divided Congress.=20

Thus, Stout continues to travel the West pushing the negawatt program.=20
California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the plan some two weeks ago when =
he=20
called a meeting of all California's generators.=20

"We thought he (Davis) generally liked the idea," Stout said.=20

Next up on Reliant's hit list is S. David Freeman, former head of the Los=
=20
Angeles Department of Water and Power and now Davis' California energy=20
conservation "czar."=20

"We've already raised the issue with him (Freeman), but we're looking to pl=
ug=20
him in," Stout said.=20

I want you folks to read, carefully, the note I received from Larry
Stirling, who is an accomplished California politician, and currently a
Judge on the California Supreme Court.  Please keep the note
confidential.

I think you can see the dilemma.  Larry's vision has significant merit.
I don't see how we can get there.

Maybe this can be part of our discussion next Wednesday.

Also, I misstated the number of Board members necessary for a quorum.
It's 8, not 7.

Lots of good insight in your experiences.

it is always better to tell the truth. And it is better to tell it well to a
hostile group. That way you get noticed and remembered.

When only one side shoots, the other side dies.

Pete Wilson taught me that you do not get noticed fencing with yourself. If
he wanted a message out, he picked a fight with someone, that way the press
covered it. 

Here is one opportunity begging to be exercised.

Go give Lockyer hell for his unforgivable comments. He is after all the
Attorney General of the State, bound with an oath to uphold the law.

He is a long-time friend, racquet ball partner, power sharer. But his
comments give you an opening the size of  the run way for the space shuttle.
You should Nuke him for it in public.

Also, you have it right on the television bits. The talking head of a techie
male is not the answer.  

Also, the location of the interview itself has to be telegenic.

So, you need someone to soften the image.  You should considering hiring and
educating someone like Starr Parker, a brilliant black woman, committed to
private enterprise solutions.

Raoul Lowery Contreras, an articulate and unabashed Republican business
oriented Hispanic that knows exactly how to handle the press.

Since the face of California is changing, the face of the spokespersons has
to change with it to be credible.

I can get you in touch with either if you are interested.  I know that they
would like to help. But both need to be retained.

All the best, Larry Stirling

Hedy spoke to Senator Burton who informed her that he is deferring to
Senator Sher on the bonding language for the moment, but that Senator Sher
has not agreed to the language which is currently in Legislative Counsel.
If Senator Sher does approve the language, Senator Burton will have the bill
sent through the normal committee process versus sending it right to the
floor.  The bill is not going to refer to a DRC, but instead "will talk
about set-asides."  According to Burton, the language will not be
distributed until Sher approves it.   We will present Enron's proposed
amendments to Sher if he decides to proceed.

Following up on my previous e-mail regarding ABX 128, I now expect it to
include the following provisions.

1.  The tax will be on excess gross receipts from electrical energy
distribution.
2. The tax will be imposed on the person making the first sale of
electrical power in or into CA for consumer consumption.
3. The tax will be based upon the amount by which the gross receipts
from the sale exceed the amount that would have
been received if the sale had been made at a specified "base price" (to
be determined by the PUC).
4.  There will be a rebuttable presumption that the base price
represents afair sales price.
5.  There will be a withholding mechnism of this excess tax from the
purchasers, other than purchasers who are residential
consumers or small business users.
6.  It will require sellers to file annual tax returns to report the tax
on excess gross receipts and pay any remaining taxes
due.
7.  It will allow sellers to file a claim for refund in an attempt to
rebut the presumption that the base price was a fair sales
price.
8.  Provide certain nexus standards to California to provide the basis
to impose tax liability.
9. Include a 5-year sunset date.

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse
group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis,
who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records
show.


During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid
to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by
the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.


Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas
& Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a
megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC
Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP.


In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period.
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour,
according to an analysis of the documents.


The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power
emergencies.


Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.


"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.


"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are
charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are
getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."


The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times
on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first
quarter.


The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in
the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the
state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not
limited to a few generators.


Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the
year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in
costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January.


The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316
in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per
hour to $271, the reports show.


In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron,
one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state,
a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.


By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.


A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not
be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the
past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.


A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to
see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be
reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of
producing the power needed by the state were extremely high.


More Power Bought Than Projected


Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.


Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.


Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply
problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell
short of state projections in June and early July.


The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well
under $100 a megawatt-hour.


A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term
power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry
closer to normalcy."

Ken,

I've sent your letter to the Governor and top legislators.

I'm also working with David Freeman in the governor's office as well to try
to keep sce out of bankruptcy.

It's unfortunate that government doesn't work more like business. There
seems to be no sense of urgency in finding the facts to make an intelligent
decision, just people who don't want to make any decision even to do that.

On a side note, Propel develops software that makes it much easier to
develop 24x7 mission critical systems including very advanced data
management. Is there someone who you'd recommend I can talk with on the
energy trading side of enron to explore the potential of our helping you
make your systems more reliable/scalable/easier to maintain?

Thanks!

Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page 
and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the 
language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime 
in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.

Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments.
Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) 
capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to 
provide the specific language).
I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore 
deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll 
provide legislative language shortly .
Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have 
Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers 
never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a 
compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date 
certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a $/mwh basis.

Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid 
balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge.   I 
know that this is a very long shot.  We should make this recommendation as a 
help to our business teams even if we are going to lose.

Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday?

Subject: Draft Bond Legislation Language

As discussed, we have two possible approaches:
1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 
days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order 
establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power 
delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction 
of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by 
suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to 
the effective date of this legislation.
We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be 
exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the 
duration of the turmoil.
Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15.  Thus 
if the wording gets changed to "who are taking delivery as of the effective 
date of this legislation" we have failed.
Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.

2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct 
such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue 
requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the 
revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond 
revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR 
bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.
Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If 
we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.

Harry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be 
necessary to ensure timely recovery....
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.
The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.

Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:
IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR 
costs.
SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, 
would be subject to a surcharge.
I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the 
clause "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."
Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the 
bond is paid off; or
Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the 
bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]
Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001

If it is possible, we should advocate:
Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such 
that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the 
amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.

And we should get a legal interpretation of  "The DWR Bond Charge shall take 
precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund 
and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 
2001."  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.

Scott

Status of core/noncore proposal
Buzz about the proposal in Sacramento is still significant and growing.
Our name is being tossed about, but in the context (apparently) of "some 
parts of Enron's core/noncore proposal."
Hertzberg is slated to meet with his caucus this evening to discuss the plan.

Conversation with Governor's Financial Advisor
Talked to Michael Hoffman today (one of Governor's financial advisors)
They've run Hertzberg's version of the core/noncore model (i.e., noncore eats 
IOU past due) using their MOU numbers.
They said that the model "can work" if noncore can contract for $80/MWH (this 
is pretty consistent with our analysis).
Hoffman's guys are doing a final scrub on the numbers and Hoffman will fax me 
the results tomorrow AM.
Hertzberg is coming up with "additional" twists, however.
The twists include increasing the bond issuance to ~$20B (to keep core rates 
down).
Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market can't/won't swallow $20B of 
additional debt (the MOU would issue about $13B).
In addition, Hertzberg wants to stretch it out for 20 years (the MOU would 
issues 15-year paper)----Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market won't 
buy 20-year paper.
Hoffman & Co. continue to work on the DWR creditworthiness issue (if not done 
by July, they'll lose the contracts they've signed, which have out clauses in 
the event that credit isn't in place by July)

Conversation with the Chamber
The Chamber of Commerce called and I re-iterated (again) the key features of 
our core/noncore proposal (as opposed to other features being tossed about, 
e.g., cost-shifting).
They were very appreciative, liked the features of our proposal (again) and 
we agreed to stay in close contact.

Finally, I have a call into Hertzberg to see what else I can learn.

Best,
Jeff

Ray Alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the Congressional Budget Office released a report earlier this week entitled "Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis."  The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov.  I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable.  For example, the summary says:

"Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective, electricity deregulation. (...)  But deregulation itself did not fail; rather, it was never achieved."

"The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to."

"Even without restructuring, California's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000."

"Consequently, wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market."

"Long-term solutions to California's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity, eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system, and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market."

On the negative side, the report summary does state that "some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more" and "the plan's auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices."

FYI.  You may have read that Calpine is close to reaching a deal with the 
state on its overcharges (about $240MM).  Note from structuring's analysis 
that Alan sent around that Calpines share of the stranded costs is about 45% 
of the total amount of stranded costs arising from the DWR contracts.  That 
is, of the $9.5B (present value) of stranded costs, the Calpine contracts 
account for about $4.4B  So, in exchange for settling on $240MM, Calpine gets 
$4.4 B.  Nice work if you can get it.

 Dear all,
>
> Attached please find this week's legislative report.  Most of the action
> this week centered around the budget conference committee hearing as the
> deadline to pass the state's budget is next Friday, June 15th.  Also,
> today was the last day for bills to pass out of their house of origin and
> sent to the other house for legislative hearings.  This week's energy
> highlights include the following:
>
> EVENTS:
>
> * Governor Davis sends letter to the state PUC President Loretta
> Lynch, urging that California's petroleum refineries and ancillary
> facilities be exempt from rotating outages. The basis for the governor's
> letter is his stated belief that even a brief disruption of electricity
> for these facilities can shut down production and supply of petroleum
> products for several weeks. "The availability of petroleum derived
> transportation fuels is critical to the public health and safety of
> Californians. Public safety agencies such as law enforcement, emergency
> medical care responders, and the military all rely on these fuels. Without
> petroleum fuels, the ability of these essential-use customers to perform
> their critical functions would be seriously impaired," said Governor
> Davis.
>
> * Governor Davis, along with top executives and business leaders in
> the state, announce a joint-Declaration on Thursday committed to saving 20
> percent in overall electricity consumption. With more than 140 businesses
> and organizations statewide, this "energy-conservation" coalition sets the
> following goals among others to reduce energy use: (1) set temperatures
> for occupied space to 78 degrees from May to October; (2) reduce lighting
> levels by 25 percent and an additional 25 percent upon the declaration of
> a Stage II emergency; (3) close blinds and shades when possible; and (4)
> turn off and unplug all office and kitchen equipment when not in use.
>
> * QFs will have to wait until next Wednesday to hear whether or not
> the state Public Utilities Commission forces utilities to pay 15 percent
> of back payments to some alternative-energy generators.  The PUC postponed
> their vote to June 13 on a proposal that would allow alternative
> generators who need the money to continue making electricity to ask for it
> from PG&E and Edison to remain in business.
>
> * The California State Senate Rules Committee, in cooperation with the
> Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale
> Energy Market, agrees on Tuesday to issue subpoenas to provide further
> background information in its investigation into whether generators are
> illegally profiteering from the state's power crisis. Eight out-of-state
> generating companies (and perhaps, eventually, the Los Angeles Department
> of Water and Power and the state Department of Water Resources) stand to
> receive papers demanding documents on bidding, pricing, and other aspects
> of power sales in the state. Those companies will be Reliant Energy,
> Dynegy Energy Services, Inc., Williams Energy, Enron Corp., NRG Energy
> Inc., Duke Energy, Mirant Inc., and AES Corp.
>
> * Governor Davis signs Executive Order D-37-01 on Monday aimed at
> increasing small business participation in state contracting. This order
> mandates state agencies to push for an annual 25 percent small business
> participation level in state contracting and authorizes the Department of
> General Services (DGS) to streamline the small business certification
> process, increase the pool of certified small businesses, establish a
> Prompt Payment Advocate, and implement a state-sponsored Economic
> Conference and Opportunity Fair focusing on enhancing contracting
> opportunities for small businesses.
>
>
> LEGISLATION
>
> * Property taxation bill -- AB 81 by Assembly Member Carole Migden
> (D-San Francisco) -- passes out of the full Assembly on Thursday with 43
> AYES and 28 NOES. This bill would return the tax assessment authority over
> electric-generating facilities back to the state Board of Equalization,
> thereby nullifying "Rule 905." Although the author asserted that her bill
> will not take away much-needed tax revenue from cities and counties, AB 81
> is considered a huge disincentive and unfair tax on current and potential
> electric generating companies in the state. IEP testified against this
> bill in committee and will continue to oppose this bill in the Senate.
>
> * Assembly Member Cohn (D-Saratoga) gains Assembly approval on
> Wednesday with 47 AYES and 13 NOES for her resolution asking the Federal
> Energy Regulatory Commission to "impose interim price caps until the
> California power market has stabilized.''  Assembly Joint Resolution 11
> (AJR 11) specifically states that price caps be put in place at least
> until California is able to bring new energy supplies on-line and for the
> state's massive conservation efforts to take effect. The resolution
> asserts that California believes not enough has been done by the FERC to
> investigate price gouging by generators and control wholesale electricity
> prices and calls upon the federal regulatory agency to "adhere to its
> governing statutes, its vision statement, and its own regulations for
> companies seeking market-based authority."
>
> * Path 15 study bill passes out of the full Assembly on Tuesday with
> unanimous support from both sides with 69 AYES and 0 NOES. If passed by
> the Senate, AB 460 by Assembly Member Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi) will
> allocate $10 million from the California Energy Commission to the
> Transmission Authority of Northern California for environmental studies to
> see if this transmission-line group between Northern and Southern
> California can be expanded.
>
* Senate Bill 39xx: Public Utilities by Senator Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough) and Assembly Bill 28xx: Electrical restructuring: Oversight
Board: Independent System Operator by Assembly Member Migden, both
originally to be heard in committee next Monday and Tuesday respectively,
have both been rescheduled to a to-be-announced later date. SB 39xx
"clarifies and enhances the state's PUC over in-state electric generating
facilities" while AB 28xx "expands the authority of the Electricity
Oversight Board and the ISO."

* Assembly Bill 35xx: Department of Water Resources: electrical
energy: eminent domain by Assembly Member Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) is
scheduled to be heard in the Assembly Judiciary Committee this upcoming
Tuesday. This bill would require the state Public Works Board to acquire
eminent domain proceedings for the possession and use of real property for
the generation of electrical power. This real property would be "paid for at
fair market value" and put under the control of the state Department of
Water Resources.  IEP opposes this bill, and will testify in opposition at
the hearing.

Bill, the only date I have heard for issuance of a decision is July 12.  As
for the effective date, I wrote to Ann Watson and Linda Serizawa pointing
out that a retroactive suspension of DA would be extremely problematical to
ESPs and probably cause complaints to be filed by customers who had signed
in good faith.  It was then suggested that the effective date should be
subsequent to whatever date a decision is issued.  Watson responded
indicating agreement but pointing out that it was Wood, not Bilas, who was
suspending DA and that Serizawa needed to respond.  Serizawa's only response
was to remind me that the email was an ex parte contact and needed to be
filed, which I already knew, of course.  However, she did not respond on the
issue (why am I not surprised?).

By the way, the memo you discuss in your email was not attached to the
version I received.

 Next Week

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
"Gas Accord II,"  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be "open-seasoned" at some "future" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff and all:  I agree with your thoughts as to the need for amendments re
DA customers that have never purchased DWR power, call it amend. 1.  I also
agree with your proposal re customers that leave bundled service for direct
access service only having to pay for the costs actually incurred by DWR on
their behalf, call it amend. 2.  I think it is a stretch, however, to
propose an exemption for any customer that leaves bundled for DA by
September 1, call it amend. 3.  This appears to be inconsistent with amend.
2.  I agree with you re amend. 4, deletion of language ending DA.  Bill

Subject: Bond Leg Language, etc.


Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons
to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the
bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as
follows:

   Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.
   17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be
   exempt from paying for the bonds.

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

   Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power
   but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power
   provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would
only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took
place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that
took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree
during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able
to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which
can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that
we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill
clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment
to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that
switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created,
that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And
if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the
bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."
The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

FYI.  Please see this notice indicating that any party wishing to comment on
the CPUC-SCE settlement must file same with the Federal Court in LA by 4:30
pm tomorrow, Wed. Oct. 3rd.   I am assuming that Enron will NOT file any
such comments, but wanted to pass along the deadline in case it was decided
to add our two cents.
