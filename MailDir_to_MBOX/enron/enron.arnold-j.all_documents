Meeting Minutes: Bristol Babcock, Pagosa Energy/Well Master, EBS, and GSS
Meeting Purpose:  Business overview, solutions identification/brainstorming
Date: 12/1/00

Enron

EBS Attendee:
Anthony Gilmore
Global Strategic Sourcing Attendee: 
Jeff Youngflesh

Bristol Babcock
Kevin Finnan
Jim Griffeth

Pagosa Energy/Well Master
Rob Bender


DISCUSSION POINTS:

1)  Bristol and Well Master feel that there is significant opportunity, with 
placement of enough BBI TeleFlow devices (integrated flow computer, 
corrector, recorder and controller/RTU) in North America that the data 
transmission needs would generate enough bandwidth demand that it would be of 
interest to EBS to provide some of its solutions to Bristol & Pagosa Energy 
"unified solutions" (quotes are mine - JKY) for the gas industry.  NOTE:  
this could take a longer term to reach the necessary "critical status", due 
to the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlow 
generates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.
1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by sales 
of product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS network 
capacity.  (a "sell-through" effect for EBS)

2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutions 
to Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption that 
a near-term solutions engagement would be desirable.  NOTE:  this could 
accelerate to the necessary "critical status", bringing to EBS more solutions 
demand due to the addition of "sell-to".  The "sell-through" effect would be 
present with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (a 
sales "channel"), as well as EBS "sell-to" BBI & Pagosa for their own 
internal consumption of bandwidth.
____________________________________________________________________


ACTION ITEMS:  
1)  Bristol will provide Anthony (Tony) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Services 
the necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI's 
(Bristol's parent co.) Info/Technology area.

2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there would 
be value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability to 
execute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gas 
well-head).

3) EBS (Tony Gilmore) will begin working on the I/T discovery process, 
attempting to aggregate total Bandwidth demand: (usage patterns/volume/etc.) 
at Bristol and/or Pagosa.
3a)  Per Rob Bender, Tony Gilmore should be contacting Al Freimeyer (sp?) at 
Pagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches from 
well-to-vendor.  Rob provided Tony Al's telephone number on 12/1.

4)  Enron GSS to contact Ron Smith - waterSCADA.com - to investigate parallel 
opportunity (gas / water analog).

5)  EBS and BBI/Pagosa will begin (internal efforts) to figure out ways of 
getting the TeleFlow CDPD data onto the EBS "Enron Intelligent Network"

Next Meeting: TBD

Please let me know if I've missed anything.

Dear Jeff:

It was a pleasure meeting with you last Friday with Jim Griffith and
Kevin Finnan of Bristol Babcock.  Perhaps by now you have had an
opportunity to review the  http://wells.pagosaenergy.com web site and
look at aspects of the "demo" section.  This is a very dynamic program
with changes, upgrades, and customization taking place all the time to
meet the individual needs of our customers.

There may well be a good fit here as we are seeking ever faster means of
communication and will be requiring a substantial infrastructure not
only for communications but for data base hosting as well.  While yet in
its infancy we have received very positive feedback and interest from
numerous oil and gas companies in the industry.  An alliance with Enron
to help us on the road to becoming the "Microsoft" of oil and gas well
automation would be a very alluring prospect.  I would like to keep a
dialog going between us to scope out areas of mutual benefit for our two
companies where such an alliance would make sense.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
Rob Bender,
President - PagosaEnergy.com

In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
 no right answer.  some examples are  strength or weakness in financial basis 
and index markets, customer flow, cash/futures spread, technical  analysis, 
storage projections, price action, etc.
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
 goal is to see how much he analyzes the fundamentals of the market
  weather - does candidate look at weather models such as american, european, 
and canadian operational runs or does he just     subscribe to  a weather 
service
  storage - has he built an aga forecasting model or does he just wait for 
others to tell him projections
  production - has candidate dug into eia production data, company specific 
drilling results, or state specific (such as texas railroad     commission 
reports)
  end of season storage number - has candidate built a longer term forecast 
of where we end up in storage.  
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?
if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero?
Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts?
If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal?
what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if 
corresponding futures are trading $5?
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

John, 
Thanks a million for your input.
I was wondering if you could outline some good responses to these questions.

With your interpretation of a good response, or points to consider, this will 
be a great resource for other interviewers.

Thanks again,

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

John - Could you please alert your back office that they are still invoicing
us on a Nov-Mar strip that was traded on June 20, 2000 at $4.105.  That deal
was cancelled per our discussion and rebooked for half the volume in
November (I beleive it was November).  Your deal number on the rebook is
QF9221.1 I beleive.  I beleive Dutch Quigley on your end was involved when
we originally discussed the deal.

Thanks and call if you have any questions.

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

may be looking to sell some naked calls soon.  can you check that i would be 
approved to sell 200 of either 65 or 70's expiring somewhere between jul-jan. 
 also, if i sell naked calls with a tenor of more than one year that expire 
worthless, do the gains get counted as LT cap gains?

Jeff,

As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater 
involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on 
the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction 
was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   

In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to 
fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in 
August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and 
identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at 
least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both 
EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq 
Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between 
both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time 
was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq 
(Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 
sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for 
comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  
During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain 
points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed 
to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS 
concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate 
the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the 
development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   

EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with 
our relationship.

Kim,

Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, Dave
Spurlin "Owns" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.
All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your life
easier.

Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; My
reaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enron
and Compaq.  We are both exposed to potential unnecessary pitfalls that are
clearly evident in the original agreement.

We look forward to resolving this issue, amending this agreement, and moving
forward in the partnership between Enron and Compaq.

David and Bob,

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS
relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities
(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.
After
our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the
point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaq
to
direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or
Kent
Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time
with
David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and
issues.

EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop
the
streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting
that
there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server
Supply
Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS and
Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product
and
Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS has
had
internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our
relationship.

The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework
for
our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until those
changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq
was
invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,
2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice
amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section
3.0 on
or before December 31,2000.
2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,
Compaq
(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   The
understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice
and
payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a new
contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBS
strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq
believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look
forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.

Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Warming Up To Green

BY ERIC ROSTON

Breathe in. Hold it. Hold it. O.K., now breathe out.

Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are you
can't see
your breath. And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin
box for the
right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. Yet last November,
Murphy Oil
Corp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundred
thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the same
stuff you
exhaled three sentences ago.

The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that
same autumn
day, half a world away, at the Hague. Thousands of policymakers and
scientists
from all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross the
zeds and
umlaut the o's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. Framework
Convention on
Climate Change. The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission
of six
gases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geological
terms--turning the earth into a hothouse. But no final accord was
reached.

In this context, Murphy's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of
carbon
(the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars) from a
Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target
seems a
bit odd. The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, and
there isn't
even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. Indeed
there
isn't even unanimity on global warming itself.

Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an
environmental
transition. Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and global
bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions
trading
system. But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning to
confront the
climate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity.
John Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat and
set up
internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. Shell and BP have
vowed
to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyoto
target--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010. "This isn't an act of altruism," says
Aidan
Murphy of Shell. "It's a fundamental strategic issue for our business."

And not theirs alone. A growing number of corporations, from IBM to your
neighborhood Kinko's, are reducing their greenhouse footprints. DuPont
is
pledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010. "There's
been a
shift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community since
Kyoto," says
Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "Now the view is that
climate
change is serious and we ought to do something about it."

There are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sources
and "cap
and trade" emissions. That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas
emission
and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their
allowance or
buy credits if they exceed permitted levels. The theory is that the
pursuit of
greenbacks will fuel greener business. "Whenever you turn a pollution
cut into a
financial asset," says Joseph Goffman, an attorney at Environmental
Defense,
"people go out and make lots of pollution cuts."

Even where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewing
the
potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to
consider. Witness
Claiborne Deming, Murphy's CEO, who doesn't see the science of global
warming
as solid enough yet to cry havoc. But Deming hears shareholders
clamoring and
the bureaucrats buzzing. Someone may ask his company to put more than a
quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted
amount of CO2.

Breathe in. Hold it. You know the drill.

How much CO2 did you just exhale? Tricky question. Yet that's analogous
to the
one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale. Until they figure
it out,
companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) how
you
buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2)
how to do
so when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right. "It's risky as
hell," says
Deming.

Many groups are working to mitigate that risk. The World Resources
Institute
and others are road-testing a system that would make trading less risky
by
creating universal carbon-accounting practices. And four
companies--Arthur
Andersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re--are developing an
exchange
where companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid of
legislative
standards. "They're trying to nail down something that will be useful
under laws
that are not yet defined," says Garth Edward, a broker at Natsource, an
energy-trading firm.

The U.S. struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the Kyoto
Protocol,
and achieved it by agreeing to a tough, many say impossible, target:
bringing
emissions 7% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. The irony of the
current
situation is that the Europeans, reluctant to accept trading at first,
have become
its champion; Britain next month will become the first country to embark
on a
national trading system.

Another practice, still hotly debated, is to assign credits for
sequestering carbon
in growing forests. Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2, release oxygen
into the
air and turn carbon into wood.

The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification, thus
setting up
an early environmental test for President Bush, who campaigned against
the
document. But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard
preliminary
briefings on the matter as the U.S. preps for the next round of talks,
to be held in
Bonn in mid-July. Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in 1990,
when he
signed legislation that capped power plants' sulfur dioxide
emissions--the main
ingredient in acid rain--but allowed the plants to swap credits. And
Houston-based Enron, an energy trader whose chairman, Ken Lay, was a
prominent W. campaign adviser, stands to be a huge player in any such
market.
So if it's good for business, Bush the ex-businessman won't need that
big a push.

With him or without him, the monetization of carbon emissions--green for
greed's sake, if nothing else--is gaining momentum. So breathe easy. For
you, it's
still free. But for many companies, the carbon meter will be running
soon. In the
very near future, pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an
opportunity.

 Hi,


  Following the e-mail you have received yesterday concerning
the new WTI bullet swap contracts, we would like to summarize what we have
done on the ICE system yesterday evening:

  -Deleted WTI monthly time spreads

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - Quest is so far ahead 
technology-wise and cheaper.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be the best and would 
purchase it now if the other group was willing to cooperate.  I believe Jim 
Ogg wants to evaluate more tools and related design tools before making a 
decision.

Michael:
Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to 
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range 
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and 
will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I was 
not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order to 
hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look into 
that for me.
John.

John -

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an 
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be in 
a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not sure 
that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're interested.

In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?
if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero?
Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts?
If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal?
what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if 
corresponding futures are trading $5?
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

Andy:
Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming 
online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close 
to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting 
limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this 
framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be 
matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what 
everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the 
industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information 
advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first 
priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a 
counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that 
will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our 
competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL 
markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you 
want to discuss.

Redmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with 
regard to EOL for UK gas.
We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a 
considerably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now).
Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are 
still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying 
brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we are 
concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing the 
strategy you mentioned below. 

Once again, thanks for your help
All the best,

Andy

Andy:
Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.
John

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Z/F !!!!   wow.    Who would have thunk it.  Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as 
wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.  
Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it 
couldn't do it this year....
A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve 
told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than 
is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an 
Enron, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling 
it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, 
cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage 
economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of 
winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.  
Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys 
are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it 
going to zero?

one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called

of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate 
at
all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon.
   also will be curious how these "loan deals" by pipes work ouut. man these

hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in

Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.  
Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  

The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement 
though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:
John

Hi John,

How are you today?  You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers.
Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program?  You
mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year
entail?  I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look
forward to seeing you again.  Do you have any tips on approaching the
interview process?  I have poured over the company website, and if you have
any tips I would love to hear them.

Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer

Things are going well here .  The big E just chugging along, bringing the

I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, 
bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level 
than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.  
Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different 
than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I 
think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very 
impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.  

Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car 
thief.

I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better 
replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why 
the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous 
methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 
while Cal 10 was .256.  
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the 
summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months 
of July and August over time.

The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for 
the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:

Jan  -.008
Feb -.004
Mar -.001
Apr .002
May .003
Jun .004
Jul .004
Aug .004
Sep .003
Oct .002
Nov -.003
Dec -.006


These premiums start in Jan 2004
On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 
4/5 spread was marked at .0475.  
In the old methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965
Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044


In the new methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885
Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028

The only change in the formula is from:
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table
to
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month 
premium table

The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I 
change them

Arnold,

John Grass and myself would be happy to update you on the status of Enron's 
Producer One deals.  In addition to the three deals listed below, we have a 
substantial "pipeline" of transactions that are being evaluated and are in 
different stages.  Besides John Grass, our distribution channels for producer 
ecommerce deals are driven by Producer Services (Gary Bryan, Jill Zivley, 
Linda Roberts and Jennifer Martinez), Nelson Ferries, Production Offshore as 
well as ECR.  Enron has just recently completed a nine city road show 
targeting the producer community.  

John Grass is also managing the Wellhead desk.

Regards, Mrha

Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

John,
We are trying to transfer your bloomberg account and need to know who within 
Enron North America can sign-off on this
contract.  Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we 
should forward it to?  We initially changed the 
name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of 
our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because
you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it 
has to be under your departments name
and we need someone to sign the contract.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Julie

Greg,

 I really appreciated the time you spent with Derryl and I last week.  It was 
an excellent start to developing the significant opportunities that will 
benefit both GSS and NEPCO.  I look forward to continuing to work with you to 
deliver value to the NEPCO bottom line.

 I have attached meeting minutes from last Thursday's meeting, including 
action items for some of the areas we discussed.  One of the action items is 
to set a follow up in January for a GSS analytical team to gather data in 
your offices, and to begin developing specific supply strategies.  I met with 
the other SPLs this morning and identified the team members we would plan to 
send.  At the moment we would like to target January 30th and 31st for our 
follow-up.  I will work with the team to develop a specific agenda for that 
visit and will forward it to you by January 8th.

 Please let me know if you have any additions, deletions or changes to the 
attached minutes. 

        Happy Holidays,
        
        Roy Hartstein

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens 
if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on 
EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the 
nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote?

Hello

I hear from Leonard that he had a very good meeting with you last week in
Houston.  We are hearing from quite a few people and the business is
beginning to flow.   On that subject Leonard did pass on to me that the
signed contract is "on the way".

The purpose of this e-mail is inquire about Enron's ability to
provide/supply natural gas to our company.  We consume quite a bit of
natural gas relatively speaking in our aluminum furnace.   I believe last
year we spent about $500,000.

As we both know the price of natural gas is rising.  It never hurts to check
and see if better deals are out there.  If this is of any interest, please
pass on to the appropriate person/group who would handle.  The can contact
me first and then I will turn over to our person here.  Thanks

Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really 
great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their 
control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could 
have done.  I believe you are one of those individuals.  I appreciate what 
you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on.  This 
especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 
months.  You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX 
liquidity to cover your risk.  I would like to offer to transfer $30 million 
out of the Storage Book to the Price Book.  Without you and EOL I could never 
have done what I've done. 

 Thanks,

This morning's 6-10 day forecast models are showing somewhat better
agreement.  All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great
Lakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for cold
Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by
days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian and
European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the
Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued
ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping
them warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this
southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian
breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold
weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears
to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases,
the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.
All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada
with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.

More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be
available with the 6:30am ET release.

-Matt Rogers

Subject: Sydney Olympics & IDRC


Planning to attend the Olympics in Sydney, Australia?

Here is a networking opportunity for our international IDRC visitors to 
experience some warm Aussie hospitality.

The Sydney Chapter would love to offer our international IDRC members an 
opportunity to combine the Olympics with a real Aussie Bush Barbeque in one 
of our National Parks close to Sydney.

The Chapter has set aside Thursday, 14 September 2000 for an IDRC 
International "Wine & Wisdom" event in the form of a Bush BBQ.  The time is 
4:00 - 6:00 pm for a BBQ, a little informal information sharing, and some 
warm Aussie hospitality.

Just let us know who you are, how we can contact you, your particular social 
or business interest, and we will be in touch with more detail.  It's then up 
to you!

Contact John Fox, IDRC Australia Regional Director, tel (612) 9977 0732, 
email: john.fox@idrc.org

Bruce Richards
Australia Regional Council Chair

I found the article in the Baltimore Sun.  Since when are you VP of natural

I'm meeting the girls at Saba tonight in the event you don't have plans

?
I wish I had a lot to pass along, but not much has changed on  my work.? All 
the analysis is still very bullish and expecting higher  levels.? I am 
receiving hourly "9" type strength patterns, which means the  up move must 
consistently continue from here.? Any drop under today's lows  is a negative 
for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type  of strength 
pattern today.? It is not a "9" type topping pattern, but one  that normally 
comes out along the way as price moves higher.? This would  suggest a 
potential short-term high over the next 2-3 days, but nothing of major  
importance.
?
I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday, October  19.? Are you 
interested in meeting so that I may show in much greater  detail what the 
work is doing and how it can enhance your activity?? Let me  know if that day 
works for you.? Thanks,

John -

I completely understand your point of view.  PaineWebber knows affluent
investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as
private equity and hedge funds.  Our group has also found that high net
worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you
structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.  We then
provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional
money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.  We also provide
the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations
to the appropriate indices.

I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your
previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor
was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.  If your schedule permits, I
would like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in more
detail.  How does 4 PM sound?

- Mike

Michael:
Thanks for putting the paperwork together.

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present
opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other
ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd
listen.

Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look
into that for me.
John.

Subject:  Buying back calls


John -

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not
sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're
interested.

Chaz & Steve,

I was able to review our recently completed conference call w/BMC with 
Jennifer Medcalf.  

During the call, Bernie Goicoechea and Ann(e?) Munson expressed that during 
their last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they have 
attempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works has 
with regard to selection/use of BMC's products.  Bernie voiced that he hasn't 
been able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that Net 
Works has, beyond what you and I know.  The BMC account team feels that 
without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely 
fashion.

The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are 
not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and 
not in writing).  Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the 
(Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) "...haven't 
kept up with the industry", and that they (Net Works) have some residual 
issues with the BMC account support in general.  Bottom Line, expressed by 
Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC 
software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.

You related Jim Crowder's suggestion related to the use of indemnification 
and liquidated damages clauses being implemented.  Jennifer and I discussed 
this situation, and our meetings with your team, in context.  We have a 
possible alternative for you to consider:  perhaps EBS might provide a hedge 
for Net Works in the form of "advance purchase" of BMC product.

For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but 
needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total 
Enron purchases from BMC.  A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark 
with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC 
time to "click" might be this:  EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC 
software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other 
$2 million is used as a "future purchases" fund, in which EBS buys, but does 
not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current 
software...

THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of 
BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is 
delivered from/by BMC.  That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other 
business units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which they 
seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product 
when they need it in the future).  In addition, you secure the business with 
BMC right now.  I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for the 
time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to 
you.

If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the 
meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on 
progress.

Thanks,

Jeff

Any idea what amount of switching in gas equivalents does the implied demand 
of resid equate to?

JA:
See note on switching. It is hard to monitor the distiallte because any 
switching is being absorbed by the incessant arrival of European cargoes. We 
hope to have you guys some better numbers before the end of the week.

PIRA report attached - bit uninspired this week, like the stats.

Crude went back to the usual pattern and built 2 .4 mbbls, as opposed to an 
implied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5). Perhaps 
surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and 
gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. 
Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 
kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold 
weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well 
above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur 
material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. 
However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.
Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not 
the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? 
Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. 
Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.
Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly 
high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.

John,

Do you think we need to see about sending an IT Tech for you and Maggi on 
Friday to make sure everything is working okay?   If we do, we would have to 
pay for their travel expenses.

It would be beneficial to you instead of having to be on the phone with IT 
for any problems.

Let me know.

CSFB informed us today that their Appalachia hedging deal will likely happen 
in the next two weeks. The deal, in short, involves Enron buying an average 
volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 
month from Dec00. 
CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a 
spreadsheet that details the volumes, which decline with time. Could you 
please provide indicative prices, as of tonight's close. 
Thanks,
Russ

Sarah,

Thanks to you and Jennifer for arranging.   I will be in attendance at 3:00 
pm and have asked either Jim Crowder or Everett Plante to also attend.   I do 
not know their availability yet due to the Enron PRC meeting conflicts.   Is 
it possible for me to attend starting at 1:00 pm - I have not been through a 
complete Experience Enron meeting ?

thanks again for your help.

1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some 
will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation 
i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back 
as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people 
think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor.
2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes 
out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away 
to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a 
$2.50-3.50 commodity.  
3. the obvious
4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward 
curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will 
end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the 
ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that 
prices must fall.
5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact 
that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably.

1- The above spreadsheet looks at HO-NG seasonally. It gives perspective on 
'normal relationships'. 

Things I need to clarify about your ng view
1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial 
shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not 
end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?
5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this 
winter?


Thanks

		 Subject: December 13 Update - Enron


As of today, Richard Roberts, FedEx Senior Attorney, notified me of the
following:

Billy Mike Golden, Managing Director of Field Facility Management,
received a call from John Patillo.  Mr. Golden was in the process of
returning his call at approximately 2:15 p.m.    Depending on what the
two discussed will determine if FedEx needs to hold a conference call to
discuss this further.

If a conference call is needed, it will occur as soon as possible.  The
attendees will be FedEx employees.  They are as follows:

Carmen Perez, Corporate Account Executive
Billy M. Golden
Gary Stoops, Managing Director of Supply Chain Management
Richard Roberts

After FedEx holds the conference call, it will be determined if FedEx
commercial and legal needs to meet with Enron commercial and legal.

I understand if resolution does not take place prior to December 31,
2000 FedEx may not be Enron's carrier.

Regards,

Carmen Perez

he sends me his stuff... i like him because he's willing to take a stand.  so 
many technicians bullshit  their way "support at 5400-5600 but if it breaks 
that look for 5250".  if every technician put specific trades on a sheet with 
entry and exit points and published them every day, a lot of people would be 
unemployed.

Bob, David and Jeff,

Please find the following EMail as a piece of the EBS / Compaq history.   
This is the amendment language developed to address the five clarification 
points rasied during the EBS / Compaq meetings in August and September 
2000.   These meetings were held to gain mutual understanding and clearly 
identify the requirements of the January 2000 Product and Server Supply 
Agreement.  

Bob, I appreciated the honesty and perspective shared between us this 
morning.   I look forward to resolution of these perspectives. 

thanks,

Kim

JA;
Six months ago we spoke about Tony moving to a commercial role. He followed 
your advice and has gained some experience in structuring. He approached me 
about joining the middle marketing group. I think he would an asset. I think 
we would bring him as an associate with the hope that he would move up to 
manager in 6 months.

Please let me know your thoughts. I would like to use you as a reference with

Jeff,

Two points:  1)  We do not want to tie the deals together in any form of 
written communication.  We must be very careful going down this path. Your 
comment below is very valid.  2) Having said that, we can certainly help 
facilitate putting together an agreement with the understanding that I will 
not put my people through a fire drill.  We need total buy in from all the 
parties.  GSS has already wasted a lot of time on this process.  Let us know 
the next step and Glenn and I will be happy to help with the agreement.

Cheers!

		 Subject: Product Quotes and Software License Agreement (BMC / EBS info)

Jennifer and Peter, welcome back...!

Attached are the notes from the EBS team and BMC organization regarding the 
proposals to EBS and Net Works (etc.) from BMC.

I am curious, Peter (or Glenn), if it is reasonable of BMC to make the 
statement to the effect that, "...the 45% discount is applied only if
we have the EBS Enron Partnership agreement in place...".  Is that cutting it 
close on the restraint of trade issue?

Bob McAuliffe has informed me in a note that if his people (Matson & Cumming) 
choose the BMC product at testing conclusion, he would support their 
decision.  Smith and Ogg have given "no go" indications.  I have received 
that information from Bruce Smith in a telephone conversation, but Jim Ogg's 
lack of communication with me is what I have used to draw a similar 
conclusion for his situation...

BMC and EBS both, I believe, are wanting GSS to do the contract work for this 
deal.  It is my understanding, Peter, that the timing of that request might 
be a problem for your guys...Perhaps we should have a quick, informal pow-wow 
about this?

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff,

Attached are all the outstanding deal proposals from BMC.  Lets push for some 
addl discounts so we can get each of these guys a "win".  I have asked our 
BMC contacts to reduce these quotes already due to our partnership but I am 
sure you know how to handle this best.

We need your help Jeff, we cant do it without you.

Hi Steve,

It was nice talking to you.  Included here are the Product quotes that we
sent to the groups.  The Incontrol has multiple spreadsheets for Bruce
Smith's projects.  Real Media is for Everett.  The other two are self
explanatory.

The concern that we have is that there is still not a quote for Jim Ogg and
therefore it is not a quantified amount for the deal we're doing together.
That is significant because it effects discounts, volume, and certainly the
more BMC product that Enron targets the better for this deal.

As mentioned in the phone call, I'll send you a soft copy of the Enron Corp
(which includes EBS) software license agreement with BMC if I can get it for
you.  Otherwise it will be a hard copy when you come over today.  It
includes the terms of liability, warranty, etc.

I look forward to seeing you today.

Best regards,
Ann

		 Subject: The EBS Enron agreement

Hi Jeff,

I hope you are doing well.  There have been some interesting developments on
the way to the Enron Broadband/BMC agreement since we last spoke.
Apparently, it is extremely important to Jim Crowder to get this agreement
in place by December 15.  As a result of the conversation between Jim
Crowder and Jeff Hawn, BMC Exec., I have been directed to help Steve Morse
and Chaz Vaughan in leveraging the best deal possible for the various
projects that Enron is considering with BMC.  As you are aware, we have
already proposed several individual deals.  In addition to those we are
including some deals in which there has been an expressed interest so that
Enron can take advantage of the pricing that this partnership will bring to
you.

The purpose of this e-mail is to give you a heads up on the acceleration of
timing that we have been directed to work towards and to let you know that
we have already agreed to bring our price down in order to make the price
more attractive to Enron.  We would very much appreciate your help in
expediting the process of bringing this agreement to closure.  In my next
e-mail I will send you a list of all the outstanding BMC proposals to Enron.

Hi Jeff,

I'm sure you already realize this, but for the sake of clarification, it's
important to make sure that I state that the 45% discount is applied only if
we have the EBS Enron Partnership agreement in place.

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

Frank:
Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer 
term Vol problem until we change formulas?

Carolyn Gilley who is a department head in our records management group has 
hired the firm, Millican & Assoicates to come in and compile all of our 
current and archived files into a more suitable fileplan.  Enron has given 
permission for this firm to handle this, but they need further approval from 
each one of you to deal with your backoffice people and with your assistants 
in compiling this information to complete their project.  Below is a more 
detailed letter from the firm explaining their work here.

Please respond to me that I have your approval to give for them to complete 
your project.

Thank You,

Subject: ENA Fileplan Project

Ina, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project:

We are records and information management consultants from Millican & 
Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to 
formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're 
taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each 
ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually 
a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain 
this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask 
that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our 
working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with 
their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff.

There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. 
Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic 
records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. 
Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention 
requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, 
once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility 
for it, and how long it must be maintained.

Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an 
imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and 
then use the "imaged" document viewable from your computer as the working 
copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to 
offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. 

During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic 
records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. 
MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we 
do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an 
interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.

 If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.  
Thank you.

Hey, I meant to check in with you and see how your dinner went at La Columbe 
d'Or.   I have to admit, I was jealous....

Matt fell through as the Christmas party date...so Noel is going (so nice to 
have friends who don't mind filling in as last minute dates!).  Maybe we'll 
see you guys there.

Had fun hanging out with you at/after the meeting on Friday.  I think that's 
the most I've ever talked to you in one sitting!!  We'll have to do it again 
soon....

Take care!
Amy

Barney's counsels.  We have offered Enron a $50 million facility that can be
used for both original and variation margin.  With these elevated NYMEX
margins, I am sure it will help your P/L.

Our counsel, Bob Klein is meeting with Citibank's attorneys to discuss some
of the small issues where we both share some exposure.

Citibank is one of your lead commercial banks while SSB is one of your lead
investment banks.  The relationship is so sound, we will work out the
wrinkles.  I'll be in touch.

P.S. Someone told me you went to Vanderbilt..any chance 1988-1992ish?

Bob,

Thank you for your reply.  I know you are doubly busy with your being on the 
road this week, just prior to a vacation.  Your answer below is perfect!  
Bob, you and your team have been very supportive of our efforts to assist EBS 
with BMC, and you have done all that we could have asked!  I wanted you to 
know that we really appreciate your support (I especially do, as a "late 
arrival" to this situation)!  Thank you again for all of the help!

Jeff

Jeff,

Assuming that either Randy or Doug were to decide that BMC was a viable 
solution for their areas of responsibility, we would certainly support 
purchasing the appropriate products from BMC.

Bob, 

I understand from Thais that you're on the road for Enron, but soon you'll be 
"on the road for Bob" - a well-deserved vacation coming up!  In light of your 
impending vacation, I wanted to do a quick follow-up check.

If we could somehow, without causing an undesirable state in your 
organization, facilitate the ability to purchase BMC solution product for Net 
Works, would you support that?

I have spoken with Bruce Smith, Randy Matson, and Doug Cummins in followup 
calls from the November 17th meeting in EB 22C1.  IF Randy and Doug were 
likely to make a pro-BMC decision (instead of for a competitor's product), 
and IF there was a way to painlessly (for Net Works) enable the funds to 
become available to make a purchase of BMC product (by Net Works), would that 
be something you would support?  I am searching for a way to help EBS without 
impacting Net Works in any negative way...but ultimately, I will abide 
whatever you demand here.  

I hope to hear from you, either by telephone/voicemail, or e-mail; if you 
could do so prior to your vacation.

Thank you again for your help,

Jeff Youngflesh

Jennifer,
After the Universal-Enron conference call with Elyse Kalmans and Misha 
Siegel, we discovered the following:

The majority of the JPI is for-profit and therefore Community Relations 
cannot be a sponsoring party.
Elyse recommended I contact Mark Palmer to discuss the sponsorship and the 
value tied to EMS, Weather, Plastics & Credit.
Universal was hesitant to comment on dollar amounts for the sponsorship but 
noted $250K would be the lowest amount for the JPI Virtual Institute. 

I wanted to consult your advice as to what tactics would be best at this 
point.  Is Mark Palmer definitely the correct contact?  Would you prefer to 
contact him on this front?  

Thanks.
Colleen

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

the implied market on that from put spreads is 5.3:1.    I'll take 4:1.

Subject: RE: ng views + wager

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

remind jim how the h/j/k spread acted this year.  granted it won't behave 
that way again until close to expiry, but i like the j/k outright much moreso 
than the condor.

Good afternoon! I hope everyone had an excellent holiday.  Now, it is
time to prepare for the next. Oh, boy, I am glad that stairmaster is
still working!

As follow-up to our 11-11-00 conference call, Clint Beard provided an
update to Ms. Hunter via telephone today.  The update referenced the
lawsuit avoidance between FedEx and a division of Enron.  Per Ms.
Hunter, she feels satisfied with what information FedEx provided.  A
follow-up conference call is scheduled for December 11, 2000 at 10 a.m.
Complete agenda, attendees and phone number will be announced at a later
date.

In addition, FedEx Strategic Sourcing & Supply Contacts are listed
below.

heffner how?
was pretty long coming into today just playing the range.  sold everything
on the way up.  will be s scale up seller probably through options.
certainly a short squeeze in trade today and i don;t think anything changes
tomorrow except maybe trade gets more confident in the short at the higher
level and if cash rejects higher prices.
will be buying lots of puts on the way up so i guess for me vol is not too
high.  i was short vol and covered it all this morn.  think we could be in
for some turbulence here

Jennifer,

Thanks for hosting the meeting yesterday. Sorry I had to leave but I had to
meet with Beth Pearlman. I believe there was a lot of good information
exchanged and that is why we ran so late. I certainly came away with a
different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met.

Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some
things are very clear in our go forward strategy.

At the end of the day, the account team (Dave Spurlin up through Jeff,
myself and Jerry) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship. If
corporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the
account. Peter Blackmore is very clear about that. He was always preserved
the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer.
That is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are
taking place within Enron.  He isn't the decision maker on deals like the
EBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other
business opportunities within Enron. Dave's sole responsibility is Enron and
making sure that your needs are being met. He will direct and assist in
making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the
relationship with Enron. I need your help with all Enron organizations to
make sure that they use Dave as the focal point. If folks continue to go
around him, situations like EBS will continue. He has to have the total
picture of business transactions happening at Enron. He will understand how
those situations can impact the business at and for Enron.

Secondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts
with Enron. Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the
sixth year being optional. The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per
year. I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years.
So at 5 years the value is $80.5M. If you have something different, let's
make sure that we are on the same page. I have attached the emails that I
received this data from.

 <<RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.>>  <<RE: Enron Building
Services Novi MI.>>

Regarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level
set very quickly. Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive
light. Compaq will honor it's commitments but we need to make sure that
Enron does the same. The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of
expectations relative to Compaq's revenue from EBS versus what actually got
booked. Our expectations were $96M a year  based on the forecast provided by
EBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday).  I find it
very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held
accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don't have the revenue to
off set it.  Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based
on expectations that were set. I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to
see how it was left.   I also need to get your perspective on the
transaction. Jennifer, if there is a business opportunity,  Compaq certainly
wants to continue in pursuing that with Enron. Provided it's equitable for
both sides.   I realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get
through it.


Jennifer, once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and
hosting Compaq. I will contact you later today.
Thanks,

  Michael,

  I left you a voice message today regarding Enron. I'm doing
a presentation and I would like to get the amount ($) of  contracts we
currently have with Enron Services. For example the $97M 5-year contract for
power. I understand that we have contracts in the Northeast and West for
facilities.

  Can you provide me with that kind of data? I would
appreciate it.

  My presentation is on the 14th of December.

  Any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

   Michael,
     Thanks for the update.  I am OK with your decision
not to select Enron (and I also reviewed with Jim Milton).  Given that Enron
chose not to rebid, I certainly think this is a reasonable decision.

     It is very important that I (and the Enron account
team) stay informed on all of these issues, so thanks again for keeping us
in the loop.

   Regards,
   Jerry

    Jerry,

    As part of our continuing communication with
the Compaq/Enron account team,  below is an overview of a recent bid
analysis for services at Compaq's Novi, MI site.   Enron Building Services
is the current service provider for Office Services related support.  The
proposed pricing received by Pitney Bowes is 11.1% or $15,147 lower than the
price provided by Enron.  Enron has been given the opportunity to revise
their pricing but has chose not to.  The recommendation is to award the
business to Pitney Bowes.   Please confirm that you concur with our
recommendation.    Thanks.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------
    Background: Enron Building Services was
providing a facility manager, shipper receiver, receptionist and admin/help
desk support for Compaq's Novi, MI site.  Compaq recently chose to hire the
facility manager as a permanent Compaq employee.  Enron Building Services
provided Compaq with revised pricing to reflect the modified scope of work.
The pricing provided by Enron was 11.1% higher than the price received by
Pitney Bowes.  The Enron account team has been informed that their pricing
is not competitive and they been given the opportunity to lower their price.
They have opted not to lower the price.  The recommendation of both Real
Estate and Procurement is to award the business to Pitney Bowes.


    Enron Building Services Current Cost:

      Base cost for services was
$190,198.00
       Admin/Help Desk
$44,787.00
       Ship/Rec
$35,521.00
       Receptionist
$38,610.00
       Facilities Manager
$71,280.00
      Mail Van/Car (remote site
support)   $13,030.00
      Management Fee
$14,210.00
      Total Cost
$216,438.00

    Compaq hired the facility manager as a
badged employee.

    Enron Building Services Proposed Cost:

    Base cost for remaining services
$128,071.00
       Admin/Help Desk
$53,940.00
       Ship/Rec
$35,521.00
       Receptionist
$38,610.00
      Mail Van/Car (deleted)
      Management Fee
$8,324.00
      Total Cost
$136,395.00


    Issue: 20% increase in Admin/Help desk
cost.

    Pitney Bowes has submitted a proposal to
provide Admin/Help Desk coverage, Shipper/Receiver, Receptionist for a total
cost of. $121,248.00 which is 11.1% less than EBS proposal.

We need you -- for the Management Conference video

We are working with the Office of the Chairman in preparing a video that 
celebrates how Enron has reinvented itself many times over in the last 15 
years, which is the theme of this year's Enron Management Conference.  We 
will be videotaping members of the Enron Executive Committee this week who 
will be sharing and swapping stories with each other about Enron's past.  
Then we will fast forward to today -- that's where you come in.  We want each 
of you to talk about what you and your group are doing right now that 
represent how Enron continues to change and reinvent itself.

We will be videotaping October 24 and 25 in EB-50M05.   Please call or e-mail 
Marge Nadasky on Ext. 36631 as soon as possible to schedule a time that works 
best for you on either of these days.  We expect the taping will only take 20 
minutes or so.

Again, your comments will help make this video fun and informative.  Thanks 
for your participation.

Craig,

It will be interesting to see what volumes of metal they 
purchase/use...especially steel, given my meeting results from yesterday's 
meeting w/Tim Battaglia and Art Bieser of Enron Industrial Markets (Steel 
Industry origination).  Heidi, thank you for helping us out!

I look forward to working with your team  on this.

Thank you,

Jeff

Please outline the Vulcan contract for Jeff and Jennifer.  They also have 
development questions as to their market capability of metals.  Please call 
Lenard at Vulcan and see what is the type, grade and volumes they purchase.  
We may be able to provide additional leverage to their purchases.

Jeff,
Please investigate this company and see if there  are additional Enron 
products and services like metals that might be of interest.  They are a 
pretty small gas user but there might be greater prospects in other areas.  
What is the value of the contract that we have entered with them?

Hi, 

I was hoping that you could give me a few minutes after trading hours to help 
me substantiate the EOL commercial.  ABC is threatening not to run it if I 
don't prove that "Enron has created the First Internet Global Commodities 
Market."  I can easily prove we are the largest, but I'm having a hard time 
with first.  I know we were, but I have to have it in writing.

Give me a call or email me and let me know when you have a second or two. 
Thanks, Margaret

John, John, John....very impressive analysis!  The first two commercials were 
supposed to be idealistic spots announcing Enron as an innovative company, 
while the next four are proof points to our innovation by showing the 
businesses we have created. 

I know you were elated to get an email from me this morning, thus proving 
that I had not been kidnapped and all those important things I work on would 
continue to be completed.  Oh and that certainly is a pretty design you add 
to your emails.  Very masculine!  

Smile, Margaret

ps, i hope you can read my sarcasm over email -- if you knew me better, you 
would understand it completely since it is rare that i'm in a totally serious 
mood. hope you don't take offense!

I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, 
bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level 
than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.  
Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different 
than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I 
think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very 
impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.  

Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car 
thief.

Details of Nitrogen Pressures and volumes.    For a new scheme we would want  
100 psi, to suit the nitrogen ring main. Current supply pressures from BOC 
are not relevant. Volume is 28-29,000 rm3/hr at Wilton and total of approx 
45,900rm3/hr when the other  sites are included.   This issue of supply to 
the other sites could be a problem as BOC are physically entrenched in the 
piped supply arrangements.

Kim,

I would like to either meet with you, or trade e-mails on your current and 
possible future target accounts list where GSS may be able to add value to 
your efforts.  Since we're ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, I 
want to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which may 
not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team 
have requested our involvement with.  I also want to make sure I'm bringing 
resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.

For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent 
developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received 
from the NYC office re:  Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, 
where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be 
with one of their medical groups based in Chicago.  After several 
unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant 
category.  Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagement 
with your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, and 
today American Express has surfaced.  Consequently, I think it's probably a 
good idea for me to make sure I'm focused on the right accounts for you.  

I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would 
work?  If not, I would have Monday the 18th available late afternoon, or any 
time on December 27th, 28th, or 29th.  When would be good for you?  Please 
let me know!

Thank you,

Jeff

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

attending. Make a note for the calander. I'm thinking we can use this to get 
people like Paul Tudor Jones, Louis Bacon, etc. to attend an Enron function, 
while also gving the traders an opportunity to go as well.

Hello all,

Over the last few weeks correspondence has been disseminated to you in 
regards to opportunities with the Guggenheim Museum in New York. We need to 
get a more accurate head count if we would like to have a private Enron event 
at the Frank Gehry Exhibit.  Tentatively, we have May 24th on hold and Frank 
Gehry has agreed to be in attendance, which is an added-value. The event 
would be a formal dinner with approximately 150-200 people, including Enron 
executives and their potential/existing customers.  Again, the attendance 
list is created through your requests but Enron Corporate covers the cost of 
the event (excluding travel arrangements).

We need to make a firm commitment to the Guggenheim by Monday.  Please let me 
know approximately how many people you would like to bring by tomorrow. Feel 
free to call me at 39056 or email me if you have any questions.

Thanks, Margaret

Subject: fund views

Hi- all the funds are trying to figure out what the play is for next year- 
major divergence of opinions.  Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.

+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the 
perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no 
industrial (basic industry type) can operate.  He tracks all the plant 
closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a 
more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track 
this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic 
conditions- like recession!!).  I will try to find out what his total number 
for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does 
not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for 
the summer.

While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels
He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) 
based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally 
think that 1Q02 sees little.  I know that the fundamentals group is tracking 
these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q 
over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.

He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, 
crude/propane....

+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 
storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the 
backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower 
baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.  I am torn 
on this one.

+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same 
analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long 
nat gas!! through vol or outright.

+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas 
just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM 
issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. 

+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: 
Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance 
(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, 
I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

Have a great holiday!  I'll be here next week.

Caroline

just when i'm turning really bearish you're starting to turn bullish on me.  
weather to me relatively unimportant.  yes, it will leave us with 30 bcf or 
so less in storage than if we had mild weather.  i think it is masking a 
major demand problem.  think what the aga numbers would be with moderate 
weather.  when we get into injections, i think we'll see a big push down.  
spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short.  customer buying still 
strong.  thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer, we haven't moved 
down.  however i think when the picture becomes clearer (i.e.-when we start 
beating last year's injections by 20 bcf a week), trade will get short.  
customers very unsophistocated.  the story they keep telling us is we're 
coming out 400 bcf less than last year, thus the summer has to be strong.  
when we start inj, customers will start seeing other side of story.  pira 
finally came out this week and said stop buying.  to me, the mrkt just a 
timing issue.  i want to be short before the rest of the idiots get short.  i 
continue buying m,f puts.  projecting k to settle 450 and m 400.

this strength cud persist awhile-is a little bullish ngas demand since we now
above parity in some places. shit theres so many things shaking my faith on 
the
short bias of this thing. weather hot /west cold est, hydo, califronia,mkt
talking new engl shortages.oil demand cont to show stellar y on y and curve
recoveriung, opec hawkish stance for px support.
  i think we close the y on y gap still significantly but im starting to
question how when,how much and how long prices come off in apr-jun?
thanks god i can trade oil cuz i have made anything in ngas to speak of. short
term still sort of neutral ngas-beleive we range bound. u prob know this but
hearing texas rr data coming out pretty bearish prodcution-good news .

Recently we signed Letters of Interest (LOI's) with three brokers.  The 
letters contemplate our interest in providing these brokers with the ability

they are trying to negotiate out of.

comments or concerns that need to be addressed prior to the execution of 
definitive agreements.

It's funny the spreads in gas.  First, in gas, you can play the seasonality 
game.  Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back.  No, of course not.  But in 
crude, m/n at .10 back is normal.  definitely a game as you try to keep month 
on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads 
and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.  
that's why cal 2 is as high as it is.  
when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt 
month.  i can't remember w/o looking at charts.  it's always the mentality 
of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter.  i think that's 
why the winter spreads are a piece.  the z/f/g fly is interesting.  i think 
z/f can and will settle backw.  just a high prob it goes cantango first.
Still seeing sellside interest in term.  definitely a result of pira.  will 
probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them 
and watches the front of the curve.  previous to that conference, the 
producers just didnt want to sell anything.  tired of writing us a big check 
every month.
so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so 
i can work at home at night.  it's really my only time to sit and think 
without the phones and eol going crazy.  they better pay me for the decline 
in my lifestyle .

what is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again 
the
numbers but pretty sure they said  +3 bcf by dec. ill let you  know/its been
along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i know
this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering
if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for
only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today.
    some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk 
too
they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing
deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be 
hard
to maintain unless we have crazy weather. we're only 2 weeks from withdrawel
period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds 
until
all the length bails.
    your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px
to make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at 
pira
including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a
win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap.
   fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on
natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you 
be
careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there will
be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs
negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to
natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on 
oil
side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im
surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks
getting hit lately??
   good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you 
some
interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up.
    by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of my
biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections next
summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.

John - I got a call from Warren Tashnek today.  He is concerned about the 
usage of the Fimat line because the trading volume is not covering its 
costs.   He wanted to know how to increase business with Enron.  I referred 
him to you.  As you know, he is so nice and not trying to start a fight with 
us but needs more trades to justify the cost of the line.  Will you please 
address this with him?  

Thanks, Sarah

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Thanks.

The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate 
unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 
8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and 
Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore 
count as a total of four deals.     

We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as 
just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL 
Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals 
are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this 
currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most 
conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results 
in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.

If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.

Bob,

I want to make sure I keep you in the loop on the EBS/BMC/NetWorks/Global 
Strategic Sourcing interactions.

EBS has worked out an additional 25% discount, which brings the total 
discount structure to Enron to a 45%-off pricing level, if EBS and Enron 
aggregate their spend opportunity.  This should come as good news to anyone 
at Net Works who might be about to implement a BMC solution.  

Also, there is additional flexibility in the situation, in that BMC will be 
willing to work with Enron business units with regard to the timing of their 
software purchases as it relates to applicability in EBS' deal.  For example, 
if Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their 
current testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail 
(or other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 
(the preference would be to get the "buy" done by end of 1st Qtr, if 
possible).  This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with 
their purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC.

I'm going to contact your leads (Randy, Bruce, et. al.) to let them know of 
the additional possible discount and the relative ease of securing it...and 
to also help make sure that what BMC is pricing out to all is the correct 
application solution in each instance.

Thank you for your help and cooperation,

Jeff Youngflesh

maybe.  hydro situation dire in west.  think water levels are at recent 
historical lows.  problem is from gas standpoint, west is an island right 
now.  every molecle that can go there is.  so will provide limited support to 
prices in east.  hydro in east is actually very healthy.  would assume your 
markets are targeting eastern u.s. so i dont know if hydro problem in west is 
that relevant.

i was reading something interesting last week somewhere on states coping with 
the coming summer---the report was on the amount of ice -not huge enough from 
this winter to provide enough water for hydroelectricity during 
summer.farmers were encouraged to cultivate crops that consume less water-the 
first thing i can  think of is low sul fueloil as natgas will be well 
supported-thus european lsfo will be arbg to the states.just my

On Friday, will there be a private reception or area for us or will our 
customers get lost in the crowd?
Probably thinking 30 invites for Friday.  Is that ok?

Hey Buster,

Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
desperately!  

I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!

Thanks honey! Margaret

Dutch:
The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to 
two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics 
book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold 
longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a 
reflection of my view of the market. 
Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was 
transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until 
this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's 
position and a corresponding decrease occurred today.

Bill, were you able to talk with Sony's Treasurer today?  As you know, we 
have a Friday deadline that is fast approaching.  We have a call with the San 
Diego team tomorrow and I would like to have an update ready for them.  
Please page me at 888-766-4103 to give me an update.

Not sure if you were aware of 2 items that Jennifer passed on to me:  1.)  We 
as EES have recently signed a confidentiality agreement with Sony.  2.)  
Sony's web site has alot of financial numbers (I don't know if they are 
broken-out).

Also, we are preparing for alternative S-T solutions.  How many months are 
you willing to allow at this point (we are coming off a 4 month deal) and if 
we do a PX plus basis deal (reduced market exposure) does that change our 
position at all?

I want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, 
Tom).  I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past.   It's an 
issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are 
okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone.  
Thanks for your help,
John

As much as it pains me to say yes, I think John has proved himself worthy and 
I am willing to let him interview for the job.  As we talked about before, my 
only condition is that you guys make sure you are willing to take him if he 
comes out on top.  If there is any chance that his past will negatively 
influence your decision, I am not willing to let him interview.  He handled 
the last experience with real maturity, but I do not want him to have any

Dabhol lenders to vote today on PPA PPPPA termination
Our Banking Bureau Mumbai

Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. "In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

Enron to suspend investments of 600 mln usd in Brazil energy sector

05/15/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the 
Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president 
and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying. 
Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of 
the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the 
construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to 
be invested in unit Elektro, it said.
"There are no clear regulations for the sector. Regulatory issues are holding 
back investments," JB Online quoted Gonzales as saying. 
Gonzales said the decision to suspend the investments may be reconsidered if 
the energy sector regulator Aneel establishes clearer regulations.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia." 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
"more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further." 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices." 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com. 
NGX located in Calgary, Canada provides electronic trading and clearing 
services to natural gas buyers and sellers at seven markets in Canada. Over 
the past six years, NGX has grown to serve over 120 customers with trading

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)
2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)

     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell
Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be
insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.
     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by
keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''
U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,
Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.
     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said
Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.
     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,
agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a
utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific
Resources of Reno, Nevada.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power
prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's
collapse.
     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset
portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer who
recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined to
comment on a potential bid by Oregon.
     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press
reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,
the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland
General.
     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more
than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added
Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about
market power,'' he said.

                            Bond Issue

     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using
the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state
might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale
because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that
slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.
     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by
utilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power
plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of
the Portland General purchase.
     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this
year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-
earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California
homes for an hour.
     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31
percent this year.
     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9
pence to 492 ($7) in London.



Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)
2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)

Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing
information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million
($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.
     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a
unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,
changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include
trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating
gas-price indexes.
     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in
calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron
spokesman Eric Thode said.
     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90
percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline
to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the
cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.
     Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.

Larry,

Thank you for getting back with me.  To answer your question:  It is looking 
more and more like the week of January 8th.  The meetings would be held using 
approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window:  the 9th, 10th, and 11th.  I have 
input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a 
tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th.  

I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) 
which each would be attending.  For example, you would probably attend both 
days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day 
meetings.  I'm not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G. 
certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems 
Engineer(s).

I will call you this week to get your input re:  who from your team would be 
going, and for which days.

Thank you,

Mission/Purpose:  Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below.  

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.  


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.  EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & 
marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.  I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Jeff

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't

leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
possible alternates...

absolutely agree.  the thought is always, even if cash is piece of shit 
today...wait until the future.  here's my question: what is the environment 
whereby f/g is worth $.50.   is there a market scenario where this happens?

other question and reason i dont do anything with jan/feb is whats gona make 
the
mkt bearish the feb? perception is stx get titire so inverses grow.. only 
thing
i can think of is will they get concerned over this industrial slowdown going
forward and weather going above-i struggle generally tho is weather was still 
so
warm last year hard to get overly bearish rest of the winter from a y on y

wish i had a stronger view-my view combined with year end give me just strong
enuf bias not to do anything. its nuts-but you pted out something a while back
is this indistries abilty to keep a contango-we dont have that but they
certainly doing their best. for cash to be at huge premiums and cold weather 
up
front like we have nt had in years, 15 dollar ny, 50 socal, 10 buck hub-shit
whats it take, not like theres huge spec lenght left.
    i guess to the extent mkt is sooo concerned about running out in 
march-they
gonna keep a huge premium in whats left of the winter strip vs summer, and 
they
shud. cash loan deals have to keep hedged lenght in mar there fore makes em
strong so long as they stay way below ratchets. other thing worries me about 
jan
is cash tite but will steadily get some relief from switching, proocessing
margins negtive , dist, resid, nukes coming up, then on day we come in and 
they
say weather going above normal 1 st 10 days of jan... BAM guess they wack it.

and yes apr/may i think is nuts, mar/apr i dont in part cuz apr whud be a 
dog. i
cant figure out how and when best way to short it/hedge my bet

  dont know-im leaving it alone, the cash makes it a jan/feb a compelling but
too many ifs, yes and dec/jan expirey, wud have thot cash wud recverse the
psychology. but not. im pretty lost john and the risks are bigger than i care 
to
take till january-spending next cuplpa weeks formulating some long term
strategies in both natgas and oil. and try not to gain anymore weight before 
the
new year.

don't care about the front.  i think its vulnerable to a good short squeeze 
like we saw on thruday and friday.  trade is getting short in here with cash 
such a piece.  if weather ever changes, which the weather boys are saying it 
might in 2 weeks, the cash players are going to be big buyers.  don't really 
want to carry length on the way down waiting for that to happen though.   
Backs are crazy stong.  cal 3 traded as high as +10.  everybody a buyer as 
california trying to buy any fixed price energy they can find

he sends me his stuff... i like him because he's willing to take a stand.
so many technicians bullshit  their way "support at 5400-5600 but if it
breaks that look for 5250".  if every technician put specific trades on a
sheet with entry and exit points and published them every day, a lot of
people would be unemployed.

i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  
still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than 
expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand 
curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get 
close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get 
us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : 
hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but 
it will be a tougher move from here.

schedule 30 min to sit down with me either mon or tues after 430.  if you 
want to get info, sending out an email survey is not the right way.  much 
easier to respond to a question in voice rather than typing it out.

Hello Mr. Arnold,

Thank you for speaking with me today with Kenneth Parkhill.  Unfortunately,
none of my teammates are available to meet with you today.  Would you please
review our questionnaire and reply back to me with your comments about the
questionnaire and answers to any questions that apply to your work.

We will follow up with you later this week if we have questions.  Thank you
for your help.

bring up a chart of f/g or g/h.   
f/g is tighter now than anytime since march 99 when ff1 was worth 2.50

John

Hope you're well.

We are doing some work here on the long term curve for UK natural gas and 
would value your views on the long term NYMEX Nat gas curve.
By long term I am talking 7-20 years. 

Our thinking is that beyond the traded period of 5-10 years forward, UK 
prices would at least partially reflect the long run marginal cost of LNG in 
a "globalised" market provided US prices were not significantly above.

As we are currently working on some long term structured deals it would be 
great to get your input on this. 

Many thanks

Andy

my brother-in-law, Scott Adams, who is based in New York City.  Since 
graduating from Brown University he has traded options on the floor in New 
York as a local for the last 8 years.  He trades natural gas options and is 
looking to occassionally do an information exchange with someone where he can 
discuss the OTC market versus what he sees going on in the ring.  If this

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.   It is 
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.   Chief of 
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.  I run the 
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.  

I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.   Never been but 
heard it's beautiful.  Next time you're in we'll go out.

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??   I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

All,

In our meeting on the 17th of November, the NetWorks team explained their 
position(s) relative to possible upcoming purchases of software, in which BMC 
might be selected as the vendor.  There were several issues and concerns 
which were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimal 
application capability (that is the "net", understated version).

Bob, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what, if anything, 
BMC could do to "fix their problem".  I relayed the gist of our brief 
conversation to EBS.

As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a deal 
done with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.  One 
of the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMC 
for a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.  Per a 
voicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.

I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for either 
November 30th, or December 1st.  The purpose is to get an update from the 
NetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBS 
to explain what BMC has proposed.  This meeting should take an hour.  

Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow or Friday.  I'll book a room and 
time that works for the majority, and confirm with a Notes "Meeting 
Invitation".

Thank you,

Jeff

agree guys are short h/j.  hard to see a big move with cash/futures trading 
flat.  agree that it has some squeeze potential though.  Started moving today 
as, simultaneously, march started running up and j aron won a big customer 
deal.  customer, maybe a hedge fund, bot 1000+ jv 450 puts.  weather 
frustrating me too.  a little long but it's in the backs so I haven't been 
hurt.  Sure would be nice to get some more weather and have this thing start 
going crazy again.  Seen liquids processing come back on at these levels.   
Would guess more than 50% has from peak.  Industrial demand different story.  
industrial economy just so weak that many petchems and others are burning 
less because of their markets, not fuel costs.  Chrystler is a prime 
example.   Any switching back to gas from industrial or switching back to 
domestic production from overseas muted by weak economy.

Hey:
Sorry I've taken a few days to respond.  Just the more I think about it, the 
worse of an idea it seems for both of us.  There is nothing good that can 
come of it either professionally or personally.  I still regard you as a good 
friend.  Nothing has changed that nor do I think we need to act weird around 
each other going forward.  Something I think we both wanted to try and we 
did.  Maybe best left there though.  
John

Jennifer:

If you are referring to the Wireless call, I was on the call and actively 
participated with Peter G.  I had the agenda discussion items and  guided the 
conversation. The call was brief and enabled HP and Peter G. to discuss 
wireless initiatives briefly. Then Peter G. literally read from my notes the 
"message" you gave him about the need for HP to support the process on both 
the buy and sell sides.  

The call went well, message was delivered and Darrin will follow up with HP 
so they can come in to Enron and present the wireless intiative.

Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy (but not Gerry Cashiola) were on the call.  Greg 
Pyle made a note of saying that HP realized that they were going to have to 
fully support the process on both the buy and sell sides.

I will still connect back with Greg Pyle by phone.

Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron  cc:   Subject: FW: Fedex and other cross sells UPDATE



Jennifer:

In my absence, the only issues I expect to arise are the Fedex and HP deals.

For FEDEX:  (cross sell)  I will be speaking with Buck McGugan, VP of sales, 
Carmen Perez's boss's boss this morning at his office in Chicago.  
847-215-4241.  This is a follow up call to the calls from different Fedex 
business units which I have received.

(buy side--John Will)  I forwarded John's latest update earlier this week 
then his note below.  First, he had several conference calls with George 
Wasaff to John Pattillo.  John Pattillo had committed to getting back to John 
on Friday (he didn't) with the specifics of ABS' counter offer to FEDEX.  
John's e-mail below notes that on Friday 12/15 by noon he heard nothing back 
from Pattillo.  Second, John is to hear back from Carmen Perez today, Fedex 
account rep, on any news from Fedex lawyers and team regarding Fedex's 
response to lawsuit issue update.  Third, George Wasaff has made himself 
available to fly to Memphis with John this week if necessary and if this will 
help resolve the lawsuit issue in our favor.  Fourth, John has been told to 
begin to pull back business from FEDEX in terms of the GSS contractual 
relationship.  I've asked John to keep us in the loop on the developments 
with these four items and what he finally decides to do 12/22 on the Fedex 
account.

HP:  Wireless conference call with Peter G. went fine.  Peter G. has asked 
Darrin to set up a follow up meeting with HP after 1/8/01 when the Enron 
wireless team returns from London.  This is in progress.  EFS/Datawarehouse 
equipment meeting set for early Jan.  Spoke with Peter G.

I spoke with Bill Dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the 
opportunity to work more closely with Enron but would want to work in concert 
with the sales force.  My e-mailed question to you was as follows:  Do we 
just wait to hear back from Greg Pyle given your phone call to him and Peter 
G. message delivered to him on 12/14?


Kinko's:  Connected Mike Rabon to Kinko's CIO via conference call.  That 
enables the EBS proposition to move forward with Kinko's.  Also, connected Ed 
Quinn and Chris Charbonneau to VP of purchasing.  He is the initial decision 
maker.  Chris Charbonneau and I got on a follow up conference call with VP of 
Purchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from 
EIM Pulp & Paper team 9 months ago.  But, the offer was not as competitive as 
the options offered by the Kinko's paper mills.  Ed and Chris have some 
homework to do to improve the offer and get back to the VP of Purchasing.  
Once we get past this initial hurdle, I will work with Quinn and Charbonneau 
on getting to the CFO's office as necessary.  So, both sides are moving 
foward here.

Also, had Ed Quinn meet with Craig Brown and Tracy F.  on office automation 
(pulled Jeff Youngflesh up to speed as well) since he couldn't attend the 
meeting.  Ed had some great ideas for the process.


Continental:  Wasaff will speak briefly with Ron Howard on Wednesday at 1:30 
PM as a follow up thank-you.  Meeting minutes sent out.  Will be working with 
Craig Breslau and T. Ramsey in early Jan. meeting to get info. needed for 
airline ticket for fuel mgt. swap deal going.  Also, followup up with Tawney, 
Taylor, and Engberg (plastics) in early Jan.  Plastics will also be coming to 
GSS/BD to give educational overview.

CSC, Sonoco, Instromet followup in Jan. 2001.

Have a great holiday!  I will be checking my work voicemail daily weekdays 
(except Christmas day).

thank you for the beautiful flowers!? They arrived late Friday and Vic 
emptied the refrigerator and stored them in there.? There were very fresh 
this morning.? The aroma is so strong that you smell them upon just entering 
my office.? It's those lilies that they used.? It really is a very pretty 
arrangement.? Thank you so much.

Uncle Elmer & Rosa are not coming this week as they have an illness in the 
family.? 

I am busy emptying the kitchen...they start Wed. morning.

See you Saturday!? Love, Your Mom

We have a number of key initiatives in process with Continental including 
sales of broadband services, weather derivatives and facility management that 
have the potential to exceed the savings being offered by British Airways.  I 
would prefer that we stay the course with Continental plus I am confident 
that Continental can either meet or exceed BA's current offer.

George,

Enron Europe has negotiated a preferred supplier agreement with British 
Airways which will save us circa $3m a year vs Continental Airlines. I know 
there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me 
know if this causes you a problem. Colin Bailey is in Houston next week if 
you need or want to know any of the detail.

John,

Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all.  
The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed.  Do you want to put 
some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to 
work on IE 5.0?  You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the 
problem is.

We are not good to go here.  These are high profile traders and I do not want 
to install IE55 just for this chatting application.  I would like for 
Fangming to resolve whatever the problem is with IE5 first and go from there.

Again, sorry to be a pain and I understand your situation, but developers 
should not develop applications with unsupported dependencies.

So are we good to go to install IE 5.5?  From you email yesterday, I was 
under the impression that we were.  I understand that you guys need to keep 
the integrity of the system, but these guys really need this program ASAP.  

Again, if you need additional support, we can get that for you.  Just let me

All,
As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 
issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I 
also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything 
from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this 
browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their 
PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really 
not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is 
ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. 

Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard 
application. 

Thanks,

Fangming

My risk group frequently uses the New Counterparty label for internal 
counterparties that do not have a trading book.  This transaction was a hedge 
for the acquisition of the paper plant we announced recently.  I'm not sure 
who the internal group is that did the transaction.  Dutch Quigley should be

Susan Scott, Larry's risk manager, will compile and send you a spreadsheet of 
total p&l minus new deal p&l since June 1.   Can you review this data and 
compare it to the respective VAR numbers for these dates.  I think you will 
see the VAR numbers way overestimate his p&l volatility.

John,
I apologize for the delay in responding, I was in class today.
We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR.   It looks as if during 
the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but 
assigned multiple master deal ID's.  (the code is "NG-OPT-XL-PRC")
For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: 
June 1st  $797 million dollars loss
June 2nd +192 million dollars made
June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)

This problem makes it impossible to backtest....

Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the 
allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily 
increasing your limit to $45 million.  This limit increase is in effect until 
July 26th.  The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution 
can be devised..... 

I hope this helps.
Thanks,
Frank

Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer 
term Vol problem until we change formulas?

This is an excellent update.  Thanks for putting this together.

Dale/Patrick - lets regroup on how we want to move this onward.  Seems like 
SJ's suggestion of our spending more time with Bill Dwyer is a good one.

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

I will forward your message to Grass, but I want to visually see the layout

Ferries' and Linda Roberts' location are very important to the

I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The 
area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, 
long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need 
to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf 
group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas 
trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and 
the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further....

Subject: VaR Methodology Change

Gentlemen,

Below is a plan of action for moving along with the VaR methodology change 
related to forward-forward volatility:

1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk)

 - determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs. 
correlations (20 days vs. 60 days)
 - stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does 
not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%

2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the 
memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff



3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment 
(Research/IT)

4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)

5. Migrate into production (Research/IT)

Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations. 
Vlady.

Currently, I work as an Strategic Planning Manager at Copergas, a Natural
Gas Distributor located in Northeast Brazil (partly owned by Enron).
Jim once mentioned that EOL intends to come to Brazil. According to the
press, Enron Global Markets will be responsable for expanding the EOL

I want you to know that my professional background includes IT, Government,
Marketing and Business Development. When Enron Global Markets decides to
expand into Brazil, let me know.  I will be more than happy to join such an
outstanding team.
My best  and a SUPER 2001,

Hello Curtis,

sorry for the late response.
An upgrade from E1 to E3 is not an option for the mentioned locations, for
the foreseeable future.
The 2. proposal is also not an option for us, because we buy bandwidth on
demand and the demands change very dynamically, therefore such a plan would
not fit our requirements.

best regards Dietmar

Dietmar,
   Attached is a message from Enron Broadband Services on sizing the
proposal back to SAP.
Hopefully his attached message is clear in terms of finding a way to
structure it
for growth based on your needs.  This would increase the size of our
arrangement if it
makes good sense for you.  Please get back to me with your thoughts.

Curtis - following our phone call this morning I met with Matt Harris and
our
structuring person (Glenn Surowiec) to review the deal. After some quick
analysis it looks like we overestimated the opportunity.

The circuits Dietmar is requesting is a european E1 which equates to a US
T1.
The hub (Wallfdorf) -and-spoke (Hungary, Netherlands, UK) model SAP requires
works out to roughly a $2.09M deal.

Clearly this is smaller than both parties would prefer.Thus we would like to
know if there are growth plans for one or more of these connections so that
we
can we propose a larger pipe (i.e. European E3/US DS3).

For example if just one of the connections can be an E3 for the entire
contract
(ten years) it would bump the value up to $8.5M. Please review this and
let's
plan on talking later today. Another model to consider would be to
progressively
bump up the pipe size across all the connections at set intervals (i.e.
years
1-3 = E1, years 4-6 = E2, years 7-10 = E3).

Please let me know what your thoughts are and let's talk ASAP.

Jennifer,
In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97 
figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference.  However, after 
speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case.  The CDs are not 
included in this figure.  

The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is 
currently being tabulated).

Hi,

This is the original quote for this project and it did not include the 
postage. As soon as I have the details from the vendor, I'll forward those to 
you.
Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Shweta.

Hi,

We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:

1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50
2 . The distribution cost (minimum for 500 CD's)   - $ 355.00
     This will include the padded envelope, the address labels, the packing 
and deliver to the post office, but the postage is not included. 
3 . The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming - 
$ 770.00

So the total amount is approx. $2,011.50. The total time would be about 8 
days. These are approximate figures only.

If you have any questions you can call Karen Hunter at X56228. or I can be 
reached at X55706.

Thanks,
Shweta.

I think you need to check your AGA model.  7.2 bcf/d seems awfully high.  
That's saying that had gas been at $2.5, the AGA for the week would have been 
151.  Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week.

   94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 
3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81
4th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 
1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ??

Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?  It 
wasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the three 
weeks by 15 bcf.  
Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 
3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if 
any.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of 
Feb.  Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d 
more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 b 
deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in 
current price environment.   I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but 
with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the 
market right now are to the upside in my view.  Course hard to imagine $6 for 
J.   Just sell vol.

my next aga number is 75-sllitely more than pira and assumes 7.2 bcf/d y on y
s&d swing-the higher prices now the uglier it'll be later.
contmaplating buying some 4.00 puts for lat 2nd q or early 3q for a few 
pennies.
so whaen we go above last years stx in may!!

beleive it or not pero been worse chop fest than gas-all i know is going to
steamboat co skiing next wed-sunday with mans refined prod groups next week so
taking postion down to the stuff i really like, dont have to worry too much

John,

Thanks for the email and the offer to route my resume in the most
expeditious way.  I saw only one job that was posted on Enron's website that
looked like a good fit.  It was an asset evaluation and integration job for
Enron North America: job # 0000105886.

My primary strengths are:

Natural gas asset acquisition and management
Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and
derivatives execution
Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a
competitive reason to be     in the market, i.e. transportation spreads,
storage, physical presence
Good customer relations/account development
Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities
Stong negotiator

I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have
someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities.  Where I am coming
from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is
doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every
trend imaginable in leveraging itself.

I appreciate any help you can provide.

Thanks.

Alan

Jennifer,
I gave Mike Horning a call I received his e-mail.   He is following up with 
Cox directly to find out what is happening on the broadband side 
(negotiations with Blockbuster).  

I reviewed Universal's request for a sponsorship (of JPI).  He was also 
asking dollar amounts for the sponsorship.  It looks like Mike is going to 
probe Daphne Harvey (Universal) for the technical knowledge he needs in order 
to make the best pitch to Universal.  It looks like he will also feel out the 
organizational structure to see if his contacts are the right ones.

Colleen, 

As part of my strategy, I want to glean information.    Hopefully it will 
give me an understanding of their process and goals, so that I may be more 
effective in my discussions with their media group.

Following are a few questions I will ask Daphne (I don't expect Daphne to 
have all the answers):

1) Help me understand how Universal wants to save money on advertising?
2) Who at Universal is driving that process?  (Names, Titles, etc.)
3) What are the saving targets? (% or $ amount)
4) Where do they want to save in regards to advertising? (Spot TV, Network 
TV, Cable, Radio, NP, etc.)
5) What is their annual advertising budget?  (Per film? Metric? Per media, 
etc.)
6) How much does she understand about media buying? (GRP's, CPM's, Demos, 
Dayparts, Reach & Frequency, etc.)
7) What is her role in this process?
 
I'm sure I will have a few more questions, as we speak with each other.

be available until next week.  It seems that all of Soc Gen's Paris office is 
on holiday for the month of August so the  credit proposal for the Enron 
facility is gathering dust on someone's desk until they return.

Utility Deregulation: Square Peg, Round Hole?
By JOSEPH KAHN

03/04/2001
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- IN the forensic pursuit of what caused California's power 
failure, the Bush administration, the energy industry and many analysts have 
granted immunity to deregulation. 
Robert Shapiro, a managing director of Enron, the giant electricity marketer, 
says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other 
states, ''because California didn't really deregulate.'' Spencer Abraham, the 
new energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a 
''dysfunctional'' system. It is the way California deregulated, not 
deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.
Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate 
about whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn, 
the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free 
markets in the rail, trucking and airline industries. 
''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,'' Mr. Kahn said. 
He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain 
the whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism. 
''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,'' he 
said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power 
company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. ''It may be one 
industry in which it works reasonably well.'' 
Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter 
administration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and 
politically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses 
is part of the Washington economic canon. 
Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its 
electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To 
satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which 
soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went 
on the auction block. 
Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power 
on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might 
have allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it 
impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs. 
Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopeful 
that the kinks can be ironed out. 
In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, 
Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, 
regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found 
ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and 
charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said. 
Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price 
signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so 
that they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and 
price spikes can substantially raise average prices. 
''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do 
it here,'' Mr. Joskow said. 
Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices. 
Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure 
Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another. 
''The political system must rise to the task,'' Mr. Joskow said, or the ''old 
way might be the best we can do.'' 
Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the New 
York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated 
industries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic 
tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which 
consumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that 
competition would slash prices. 
But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline 
prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities 
of electricity, Mr. Kahn said. 
Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep 
prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical 
integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn 
said. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal 
ways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them 
to be built. ''The players all depended on one another,'' he said. 
California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made 
people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for 
widgets.

WASHINGTON -- Three corporate executives are under consideration to lead the 
Air Force, Army and Navy, administration officials said Saturday. 
The three have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce this week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, the Washington Times reported, quoting 
unidentified sources.
Gordon R. England, 63, who retired recently from General Dynamics Corp., 
would be nominated as Navy secretary; James G. Roche, 61, a vice president at 
Northrop Grumman Corp., is the pick to head the Air Force; and the choice to 
head the Army is Thomas E. White, 57, a retired Army general and an executive 
with Enron Corp. White also once worked as an assistant to Colin L. Powell, 
Bush's secretary of State.

WASHINGTON--Three corporate executives are under consideration to lead the 
Air Force, Army and Navy, administration officials said yesterday. 
The three men have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce next week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, The Washington Times reported 
yesterday, quoting unidentified sources.
But two Bush administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told 
The Associated Press that President Bush has not made a decision and that the 
nominations were not a certainty. 
The Times said Gordon England, 63, who retired last week as a vice president 
at General Dynamics, would be nominated as Navy secretary. England was 
responsible for the company's information systems and international programs. 
The newspaper also said James Roche, 61, a vice president at Northrop 
Grumman, was the pick to head the Air Force. Roche, a retired Navy captain, 
worked in the State Department during the Reagan administration and later was 
Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The nominee for Army secretary was said to be Thomas White, 57, a retired 
Army general and an executive with Enron, a Houston-based energy company. 
White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell 
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Enron's Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain / Critics regard Kenneth Lay as 
deregulation opportunist
David Lazarus
Chronicle Staff Writer

03/04/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A1
(Copyright 2001)

Kenneth Lay is one of the energy "pirates" accused by California's governor 
of fleecing consumers. As chairman of Enron Corp., the world's largest energy 
trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. 
But that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking 
knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy 
mess.
"It's very unfair," Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality. 
"He's trying to vilify us. But we didn't make the rules in California. We had 
nothing to do with creating the problem." 
He gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston's downtown 
skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky. 
"Everyone played by the rules," Lay said. "Now our reputations are being 
maligned." 
In a sense, he's right. The ultimate blame does rest with California 
policymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such a 
ham-fisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting 
loopholes in the system. 
But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process. 
"Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for 
deregulation in California," said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst 
in the Austin office of Consumers Union. "A lot of what's happening in 
California was their idea." 
Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said Enron was 
especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where 
wholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent 
System Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid. 
"This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor," said 
John Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded as 
the godfather of California's bungled deregulation measures. 
"Enron isn't in the business of making markets work," Rozsa said. "They're in 
the business of making a buck." 
In an ironic twist, however, Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping 
the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company has 
that much clout. 
SEEKING LAY'S BLESSING 
Thus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission 
lines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to call 
recently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan. 
This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had 
been castigated by Davis in the governor's State of the State speech. 
"I told him we couldn't support it," Lay said, a hint of a smile playing 
across his lips. "It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid 
and, longer term, it could make things worse." 
Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enron's big cheese? 
Simple: Davis will need the Bush administration's backing to make the 
power-line sale fly, and, many believe, there's no faster way to reach the 
new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron. 
Lay, 58, and his company have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years, and he placed Enron's private jet at 
Bush's disposal during the presidential race. 
So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is now 
serving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as 
he sees fit. 
"There's a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political 
relationships to get what it wants," said Craig McDonald, director of Texans 
for Public Justice, a watchdog group. "What Ken Lay thinks energy policy 
should be isn't very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it 
should be." 
ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
Lay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his close 
rapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited 
the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months. 
"I have known the president and his family for many years," Lay said. "I've 
been a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in his 
policies." 
He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are 
"grossly exaggerated." 
Still, it is striking that Bush's quick decision after taking office to limit 
federal assistance in solving California's energy woes virtually mirrored 
Lay's own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration's 
hands-off approach to resolving the crisis. 
Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to Enron's bottom 
line. The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year. 
They haven't hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay package 
more than tripled last year to $18.3 million. 
Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company's 
California earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Lay 
conceded that Enron's profit from California energy deals last year was "not 
inconsequential." 
"We benefit from the volatility," he said. 
CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE 
That's putting it mildly. It could be said that California's energy mess was 
tailor-made for Enron, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a 
captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are 
simultaneously soaring skyward. 
To understand why that is, one must look closely at Enron's complex business 
model. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy 
deals. 
Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy 
regulator, set about completely reinventing Enron in 1985 after taking over 
what was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator. 
As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of 
energy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas 
is needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time. 
Enron is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage 
to consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers 
and sellers throughout the country. 
It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually 
creative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas 
prices up, Enron might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in return 
for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants. 
Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the 
proceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it 
ships back to the original utility. 
"We do best in competitive markets," Lay said. "These are sustainable 
markets." 
TRADING FRENZY 
Enron's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly 
young, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of 
the best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost 
frat-party atmosphere. 
The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an 
Internet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336 
billion, making Enron by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity. 
Kevin Presto, who oversees Enron's East Coast power trades, called up the 
California electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks, 
he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at 
$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275. 
"Some days we're at $250, some days $300 and some days $500," Presto said 
over the steady thump-thump of the trading floor's rock 'n' roll soundtrack. 
"There's truly a problem out there." 
This is a recurring theme among Enron officials: California's electricity 
market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down. As 
Lay himself put it, "The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace." 
In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isn't just 
making piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going. 
LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA 
The company's energy services division, which handles the complete energy 
needs of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of 
California and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., and 
even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park. 
Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market 
values. At the same time, Enron sells power to PG&E at sky-high wholesale 
levels. 
In other words, Enron is buying back its own electricity from PG&E for just a 
fraction of the price it charges the utility. 
"These guys are the pariahs of the power system," said Nettie Hoge, executive 
director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. "Why do we need 
middlemen? They don't do anything except mark up the cost." 
To be fair, energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient 
marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers. 
This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where Enron actively trades among 
about 200 market participants. 
But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like Enron can 
easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceived 
regulatory framework. 
Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state 
committee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame Enron and other 
power companies for pursuing profits in California. 
"California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules 
California set up," he said. "At the end of the day, they will behave to 
enhance their bottom lines." 
But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next 
year, Turner said he has learned from California's experience -- and is 
taking steps to prevent Texas' power giants from shaking down local 
consumers. 
LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE 
He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission 
more authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies are 
fighting the legislation as hard as they can. 
Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what California 
officials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power 
by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher. 
"I have that concern," he said. "I don't necessarily take these companies at 
their word." 
For his part, Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated 
electricity prices. 
"I don't know of any of that," he said. "It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories." 
As a sign of Enron's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Lay 
said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power 
contracts on behalf of utilities. 
So how many contracts has Enron signed? 
Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and a 
harder, more steely look glinted from his eyes. 
"None," he said. "We won't be signing until we're certain about recovering 
our costs." 
Consider this a shot across California's bow.

Enron boss says he's not to blame for profits in energy crisis

03/04/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely from 
California's energy crisis, but Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says he 
shouldn't be a scapegoat in California's energy crisis. 
That hasn't swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such as 
Houston-based Enron for selling expensive power to California.
"Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians 
hostage," Davis warned in his State of the State address. 
More recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state 
looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities. 
"I told him we couldn't support it," Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in 
an interview at his Houston office. "It will lead to an even less efficient 
transmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse." 
Lay is not just any private-sector energy czar - Enron Corp. is the world's 
largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Lay 
and his corporation have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enron's 
private jet during the presidential race. 
But Lay said it's economics, not politics, that matter in California's energy 
crisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energy 
brokers for the protracted problems. 
"We didn't make the rules in California," Lay said. "We had nothing to do 
with creating the problem." 
The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of the 
power industry in 1996. Enron encouraged deregulation, and the state's 
ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation. 
Enron's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to 
$101 billion. Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16 
million in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared 
with less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999. 
Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off California's crisis, though he 
conceded the profit was "not inconsequential." 
"We benefit from the volatility," said Lay, who took over Enron in 1985 and 
has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of 
electricity as a commodity. 
But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by 
insisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep 
the lights on in recent months. 
"I don't know of any of that," he said. "It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories."

The Stadium Curse? / Some stocks swoon after arena deals
Kathleen Pender

FINAL

(Copyright 2001)

Is buying the name of a big-league stadium the kiss of death for a company, 
or does it only seem that way? 
>From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field 
outside Boston, the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies 
whose stocks have been sacked.
The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after 
PSINet, whose stock has fallen 92 percent to $1.25 a share since it bought 
naming rights. 
The problem names are not all tech. 
The owners of the TWA Dome in St. Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are 
looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt. 
TWA is an airline. Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom. 
The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if 
Edison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison, 
runs out of juice. 
Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens 
or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a 
ballpark or arena. 
In fact, many were at their peak. 
Which begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which 
they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights? 
Brian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders if 
companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the "Sports Illustrated 
curse." It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI 
magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle. 
Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.com Chief 
Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine's 1999 person of the 
year just before his company's stock price tanked. 
Don Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn't 
think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals. 
"You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming 
rights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peak 
in its business," says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham 
Group in Denver. 
TRACKING NAMING FIRMS 
To find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of 
publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league 
sports venues in North America. 
I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, including 
Miller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and Pac 
Bell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications, 
which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio). 
I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals 
are, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generates 
tons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is 
negative and even if the stadium won't open for several years. 
Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index during the same period. 
The bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names 
are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced, 
according to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each bought 
two names and were counted twice.) 
But -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&P 500 during the 
period since their respective deals were announced. 
So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee the 
company will beat the market. 
WINNERS, LOSERS 
The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide 
variety of industries. 
The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company. 
Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746 
percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium. 
The next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecom 
equipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) and 
Enron (energy). 
The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI 
(Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network 
Associates (network security software). 
Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming 
rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998. Since then, it has suffered 
a string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned 
its accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and 
1998. Its CEO resigned in December. 
Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the 
coliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years. 
The company "has been paying us," says Deena McClain, general counsel with 
the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. "We haven't had any 
discussions with them" about changing the contract. 
Most naming-rights contracts have "out clauses that allow the parties to 
extricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial 
difficulties or if a team moves," says Hinchey. 
Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may 
benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early. 
That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s, 
when $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average. 
In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of 
the Washington Redskins. 
In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name on 
the new home of the New England Patriots. It's questionable what kind of 
shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year. 
The "10-gallon hat of naming rights deals," says Hinchey, is in Houston, 
where Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name the 
Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself. 
Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal 
was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates. 
Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a 
stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends. 
But Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, "you have to 
look at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It sounds 
like big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years. If you take out 
things the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it's 
small potatoes." 
WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH 
The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game 
is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print. 
"This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding," says Jennifer 
Keavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal. 
She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, "won't even buy you a 
Super Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised 
football game, maybe." 
The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboard 
for the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports. 
Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site 
exposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might 
offer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers. 
Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name 
because they sell consumer products or services. 
But not always. 
3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995. 
"It was a good move for them," says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from 
Sports Venues. "They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility 
they were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field, 
and they wanted to look like a fun place to work." 
Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years. 
The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility 
will be a loser. 
"Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and 
hospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not 
performing well," Hinchey says. "But corporations realize the team's success 
on the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in the 
dumps." 
The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium 
owners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when they 
sell a name.

The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.   It is
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.   Chief of
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.  I run the
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.

I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.   Never been

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best
part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends
in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City
on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to
be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??
I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

 In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,
and so on.

 The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

 Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

 As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

 $______ per/share

yea,  i think the two dumps in the market are when everybody realizes the 
loss of demand, which is in the first 4 inj numbers.  customer buying and 
fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level.  if my theory holds, 
eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes.  second 
puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4-5% on y/y basis, 
demand still weak (economic weakness isn't a 3 month problem), industry 
realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you 
should, and early winter weather will not match 2000.  we develop large y/y 
surplus in x and z.  z futures hold up because some risk premium still exists 
for rest of winter.  by late december, just trying to find a home for gas.  
think decent chance f futures finish with a 2 handle.

just when i'm turning really bearish you're starting to turn bullish on me.
weather to me relatively unimportant.  yes, it will leave us with 30 bcf or
so less in storage than if we had mild weather.  i think it is masking a
major demand problem.  think what the aga numbers would be with moderate
weather.  when we get into injections, i think we'll see a big push down.
spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short.  customer buying
still strong.  thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer, we
haven't moved down.  however i think when the picture becomes clearer (i.e.
-when we start beating last year's injections by 20 bcf a week), trade will
get short.  customers very unsophistocated.  the story they keep telling us
is we're coming out 400 bcf less than last year, thus the summer has to be
strong.  when we start inj, customers will start seeing other side of
story.  pira finally came out this week and said stop buying.  to me, the
mrkt just a timing issue.  i want to be short before the rest of the idiots
get short.  i continue buying m,f puts.  projecting k to settle 450 and m
400.

talking new engl shortages.oil demand cont to show stellar y on y and curve
recoveriung, opec hawkish stance for px support.
  i think we close the y on y gap still significantly but im starting to
question how when,how much and how long prices come off in apr-jun?
thanks god i can trade oil cuz i have made anything in ngas to speak of.
short
term still sort of neutral ngas-beleive we range bound. u prob know this
but
hearing texas rr data coming out pretty bearish prodcution-good news .

I am starting options on EOL in about two weeks.  As we discussed earlier, I 
don't have the appropriate manpower to run this in certain circumstances, 
such as when I'm out of the office.  As such, I'd like to bring in John 
Griffith for anohter round of interviews for an options trading role with 
your permission.  
John

Dave:
A couple of issues:

1.  We continue to have a number of transactions that fail because of credit 
exposure.  These are companies that have excellent credit, such as Duke, 
Dynegy, Equitable, Mieco, etc, but have a fixed credit line on EOL that they 
blow through periodically.  They get a failed trade and it often takes 5-10 
minutes to rectify the problem, at which time we've lost the trade.   We need 
the major counterparties to have unlimited credit on EOL, just as they have 
in normal trading.

2.  As a corrallary, I am under the impression that when a trade fails 
because of credit, the counterparty does not get an explanatory error message 
describing what happened and what to do.  When a credit failure happens, the 
counterparty will often keep clicking on the same product, getting the same 
error message

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Andy:
The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on 
the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  
Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all 
strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, 
making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 
cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller 
size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower 
delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a 
market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the 
money.  
Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way 
wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 
4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 
3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a 
strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate 
having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.

In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles 
struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for 
what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying 
to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier 
for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more 
sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if 
someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to 
call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a 
market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would 
anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just 
the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.

Kevin Foster with Risk Magazine is working on an article for the June issue 
regarding Gas Markets in the U.S. Basically, he is interested in Enron's 
opinion of:

1. Physical Supply/Demand of gas and how this is affecting financial trades
2. Where do we anticipate gas prices going over the summer?
3. The state of the industry--any major issues that may affect the market?

If this sounds like a story we would be interested in doing, please let me 
know and I will coordinate a short phone interview with Kevin Foster. I know 
it usually works best for your schedule to do this after 4pm, so please let 
me know if Tuesday after 4 would be good for you. 

Thanks for your help and please call me with any questions.

Subject: Re: Sunday  

Andy, Here is what I am aware of regarding availability of EOL for Sunday 
Trading.

The first Sunday that we opened for trading (I believe it was 10/1), we 
experienced a shutdown of the entire site late Saturday which, unfortunately 
included our monitors, which is why we were not aware of it until just prior 
to trading time.  Trading was to open at 2:00pm and we had the site up by 
aprox 2:15pm.

I am not aware of any issues on 10/8 and 10/15.

This past Sunday, 10/22 we had a problem with a release that we pushed out on 
Saturday.  We are working on our release procedures and will make every 
effort to have smoother releases in the future.

I hope this answers your questions, if not feel free to give me a call.

I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed 
the opening until 6:05.  This is the third time in four or five sessions when 
EOL had problems on Sunday.  Anything you can do to improve reliability would 
be appreciated.
John

Re: trucking LNG to California - 

The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option 
for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a 
couple of reasons for this. 

First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only 
two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, 
affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military 
and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG 
Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck 
fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I 
was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is 
operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and 
Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern 
California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by 
ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and 
subsequent loading onto trucks.

Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The 
average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into 
820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could 
deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely 
transfer it into storage. 

The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would 
be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under 
repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 
mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a 
time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, 
ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some 
reason. 

I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. 
I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located 
peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. 

Please let me know if you have specific questions.

Jennifer:

Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity 
with Kinko's as he sees it.  I would like to forward this on to James 
Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and 
cc Mike Rabon).  Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it 
overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary 
King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?

Thanks for your suggestion!  SJ




Mr. Thompson:

Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband 
Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate 
broadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met Mike 
Rabon in the October 6th meeting. 

Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had 
expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.
IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.
IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.
Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about 
your storage strategy and growth.
Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the 
actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the 
hubs.
Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality 
H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like to 
speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.
Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be 
communicated to the proper person.

Dear AEDC Member,

One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena
is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  This
standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic
developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and
examining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and
more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more
comparable than ever before.

A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to
see how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25
tables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at the
bottom of the page will access the additional tables.

You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use
the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into
a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for
the standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the
standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which
approach works best for you.

Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic
development profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the many
areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't
received the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way to
tell their story.

If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for
notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the
standards and their use.

In preparation for our discussion tomorrow, can you run VAR numbers for some 
mini-portfolios:

Portfolio 1.   +1000 November Nymex
                -1000 December Nymex

 2.     -1000 July Nymex Straddles

 3.     +1000 July 2002 Nymex

 4.     +1000 July 2002 Nymex
         - 1000 August 2002 Nymex

 5.     +1000 July Socal Basis

 6.     +1000 July Chicago Basis
          -1000 July Michcon Basis

 7.     +1000 July Henry Hub Index

 8.     +1000 July 2003 Chicago Basis

Again, these are separate portfolios.  I'm trying to check that the VAR 
numbers make logical sense.  
Thanks,
John

		 Subject: Universal (JPI) sponsorship

Stewart,

Per our phone conversation, Universal is looking for sponsorship funds to 
grow JPI (Jurassic Park Institute).

Enron Media has an opportunity (perhaps) to provide advertising risk 
management services beyond their Motion Picture Group, to their Music, Home 
Video and Recreation Groups.

There may be an opportunity for EBS to provide bandwidth in lieu of 
sponsorship dollars or some other type of arrangement.

I am trying to reschedule my meeting with their motion picture advertising 
team for the second week in January, so I'll stay in touch to see if you 
develop an opportunity through their global sourcing group.

Regards,

enjoy cabo-im not really surpised at lack of dmand recovery-will be slow to
recover esp with failing econ growth. the one thing concerns me about bear 
side
is implied demand for us petro products is huge. doesnt seem to suggest an
econmic impact on that side. having said that absulte px for petro much much
lower relative to natgas

Subject: Re: contangos vs winter putspds



agreewith all, im mega bear summer 2nd q but for the time being weather and 
as u
said uncertainy likely to lend itself so little downside until either weather
gets warm or injections get big. i dont see the flow as you know but i talk 
to a
cupla utitlities and the bias same as you menioned. ive neutralized bear book 
a
bit cuz i cant afford to fite this thing. with deep pockets tho-i scale up 
sell
next 2-3 weeks take a bet on 200 ish injections in april and 400 in may-ie
records
  aug/oct-yes-low risk-wasnt substantially more inverted when we were 4 bucks
higher-low risk but not a great reward. oct/nov-yea-wont make much for another
few months on that so it range trades but ill cont to bersd it cuz if end 
summer
that strong im always always more bullish the front of winter.
  other thing i wonder is how wide these summer contangos cud get-as everyone 
so
bullish futs for the next few weeks at least.
   weather here sucks to day-tree almost fell on me driving into work-close
one,sahud be about 2 ft of white stuff when its said and done. dunno how long 
i
can stay but doesnt look all that great for me getting out to steamboat 
manana!!

heres a hypothetical.... we agree that demand loss y on y somwhere from 4.5 to
5.0 today, do you guys think that we can see a substantial demand recovery if
prices dont retreat? my ffeeling is no for at least another 90 days or
more.thots?
   any thots on flat px today-im slitely long vs bearsds?

Hey:
Sorry I didn't get to come by before I left. I have been in London since 
12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday 
season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron)
 Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I 
suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, 
Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he 
should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. 
Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a 
large role in turning the crude and products group around. 

 Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of 
good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the 
gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products 
(especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I 
think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together.

Happy New Year!
Jen

PS I am coming back on the 6th. Once I finish up the week, I am off to Berlin 
for New Year's Eve and then a little trip over to Prague.

PPS If there is any other info you need let me know. By Jan 15, I should have 
about 15 analysts and be able to devote some to special projects.

I suggest that we initially cover this person out of the Portland office.  
One of our middle marketers can easily get up to meet with this guy.  
Depending on the magnitude and complexity o their power and gas needs are we 
will then pull in the appropriate people.  Phillip and John, let me know if 
this works for you.

Jeff,

Per our conversation this morning, I will list the items in question.  I am
also forwarding this to Kelli Wallin in our accounting department to follow
up on as well.

* ACCOUNTING:  Please see that all service charges were posted as 18%,
per contract
* JEFF: I will fax you the comp ticket showing the 1 hour reception
posted to The Woodlands House account.
* ACCOUNTING: Please fax Jeff the back up for the package handling
charges. $451.35
* ACCOUNTING: Please adjust (1) wireless mouse charge for a total of
$156.41
* JEFF: In regards to the lunch charges, we charged a day guest rate
to include lunch in The Woodlands Dining Room @ $57.00 for  40 day
attendees.  You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package.  However,
when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box
lunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf.  Thus, 80+40=120 - 100
(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The
Woodlands Dining Room.  We billed you for the total amount of persons over
the 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.
* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms.  Enron had a guarantee of
120 attendees.  We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees.  This particular
day, (5) breakouts were ordered.  The audio visual in the additional
breakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.
Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.

Jeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as
possible in order to remit for payment.  Please feel free to call me should
you have further questions.  Thank you for your business!

I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in 
Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA 
certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in 
the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it 
may not be doable.  

Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few 
years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their 
own boat.

I will keep you posted -

I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed 
the opening until 6:05.  This is the third time in four or five sessions when 
EOL had problems on Sunday.  Anything you can do to improve reliability would

Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions, 
it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system 
not supplying us with that info.

John,

As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, 
whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was 
that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care 
whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we 
could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still 
will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to 
reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed 
transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I 
would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we 
deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your 
thoughts/concerns.

-Andy

suggestions that this new deal cud be better cuz of the guarantees + bonus. i
dont know yet, hasnt been offered or even discussed directly. but if it does 
and
its very good they gonna need a ngas guy in houston. i think we could put

Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the risk/reward 
play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and generator buying 
would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the 
strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.  
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2 
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be 
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching, full 
liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric generation 
demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d 
greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out 
of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start really losing 
demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about recession in 
industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think 
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward 
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage 
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a month 
ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas 
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day y 
on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C 
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power 
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than heat. 
i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to 
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon and 
ill
keep you posted.

I think so in a month or so.  Problem now is that there is so much customer 
buying on any pullbacks and selling on rallies that the market, with such a 
flat curve, is going nowhere.  That will change, but it's going to take a 
while.  I like it eventually.

Heidi:

Please outline the Vulcan contract for Jeff and Jennifer.  They also have 
development questions as to their market capability of metals.  Please call 
Lenard at Vulcan and see what is the type, grade and volumes they purchase.  
We may be able to provide additional leverage to their purchases.

Thanks,

Craig

Jeff,
Please investigate this company and see if there  are additional Enron 
products and services like metals that might be of interest.  They are a 
pretty small gas user but there might be greater prospects in other areas.  
What is the value of the contract that we have entered with them?

Yea, problem is I left at noon to catch my flight, but Marc had a later 
flight because NY is closer to Columbus than here. Right after I left, the 
market got very busy and Marc decided to stay at work and not go.  So that 
sucked.

Mike:

The presentation is a great idea!  Per our conversations tonight, let's keep 
the EBS slides to 4-5 pages maximum; I have spoken to Chris Charbonneau and 
he will have an even briefer discussion on EIN's pulp & paper initiative.   
The purpose of the call is to introduce you to Kinko's decision makers who 
can understand a brief overview of your questions then provide the phone 
numbers of the appropriate Kinko's contact who could work with you on your 
value proposition definition.  Subsequent to the call, you would then follow 
up with meetings as you deemed appropriate.  This is not a call for 
details!   

Since you'll need additional time and we don't want to waste the time of the 
other Enron participants (Chris Charbonneau and Ed Quinn), they will present 
first then leave you with the balance of the time.  You noted that you'd be 
forwarding your overview to me later this evening.  Thanks.  I'll  look 
forward to receiving it.  Tomorrow, I'll add EIN's(Enron Industrial Markets) 
piece then cc:mail you on what I send to James Thompson.

Thanks again for the excellent suggestion.

Sarah-Joy,
Dorothy and I have assembled a short PPT that is currently in Matt's hands 
for review. Once finalized we will forward it to Chris Chabonneau who will 
add Pulp and Paper slides. Total length to be around 12 - 15 slides. I spoke 
to James Thompson who recommended this approach. We will have the 
presentation to James by noon Wednesday. He will ensure that the Kinko's 
participants have the presentation before the call.

John,

Several months ago we talked about the development of an option analysis tool 
that could be used to stress test positions under various scenarios as a 
supplement to our V@R analysis.  We have recently completed the project and 
would like to solicit your feedback on the report results.

We have selected your NG price position for April 4, 2000 (POST-ID  753650) 
for the initial analysis.  Attached in the excel file below you will find:

Analysis across the various forward months in your position 

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Summary of your Overall Position analysis

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Multiple Stress Analysis

The attached Word document demonstrates the multiple stress choices.  I have 
included a tab in the excel file that demonstrates the theoretical P/L 
resulting from shifts in both volatility and underlying price.  


Please note that the percentage changes across the column headers are not in 
absolute terms (for example, if the ATM volatility in a given month is 40% 
and the stress is -10% then the analysis is performed under a volatility 
scenario of 36%)









Thanks,

Rudi

Channel Inside FERC

Hi Eric,


Please find below the detailed terms of a possible deal that we have been
talking about during our phone conversation this morning.


Nature of deal : If the transaction takes place, Societe Generale would sell a
financial fixed price swap (flat price, not basis differential) to Enron. The
monthly settlement would be financial. There would not be any  exchange of
physical product.


Period of the deal : June 1st, 2001 to January 31st, 2021.


Used Reference :  Natural Gas-Houston Ship Channel Index Inside FERC , monthly
settlement.



Volumes of the financial swap transaction : Please find below the volumes 
given
month by month in MMBTU.

(See attached file: volumes-10-5-01-for-Enron.xls)

Since there is a tiny chance that the deal trades today, could you please 
check
if you have credit with SG for this period.
If not, could you find out how much time it approximately takes to get the
credit.
In terms of credit, SG is good with Enron for this period.

Thank you,

Alexander Werner

Hi John,

I work in Corp. PR and Eric Thode recommended that I drop you and email with 
respect to a question I have about specific trade types that no one seems to 
know the answer to.  I wanted to know if you knew what ST and MLT trades are 
and just so you know, in case it makes a difference, these are in context to 
French power trading.  I know you are extremely busy but if you get a chance 
I would greatly appreciate your comments.

I spoke to Vlady this afternoon regarding the alternative VAR methodologies.  
I think changing to a Riskmetrics historical VAR system is more defendable 
and objective, will provide more consistent results, and will create more 
realistic results.  I understand Vince has a similar opinion.   
John.

IMPORTANT MEMO



Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Tom:
My assistant spoke to Judy Smith about myself and my partner grabbing an 
extra seat on the jet to Tampa. 

My partner and I were invited to the game by a couple of gentlemen from New 
York that I do business with.  Unfortunately, since I run the nat gas 
derivatives desk and February expiration is next Monday, the only way we 
could go is if the jet were coming back Sunday night.  No commercial flights 
would get us back in time.  

Judy indicated it was fine if we caught a ride on the way back, so my 
contacts in NY booked the trip, including buying game tickets.  I am now 
hearing that you may be leaving early Sunday night.  I was just wondering if 
your plans had firmed up.  Obviously, it would be tremendously helpful to me 
if the plane were leaving after the game.  

Please advise,
John

imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one 
pipeline running to your well.  the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you 
because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way.  split connect 
means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer 
receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you 
don't have  to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe.  

i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight.   are you free 
saturday day and night?

pira's certainly got the whole market wound up.  I've seen a wave of producer 
selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.  Most 
selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.  Pira certainly commands a lot of respect 
these days.  Too much, probably.
The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in 
natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March 
and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude.  
These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there 
were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made 
a penny.  
Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?  That seems hard to believe.

cmon give me some credit-you think ive been doing this this long w/out know
who's doing what! im i ny for the pira conference-thyre pretty bearish cal 01
and 02-will be interesting to see if/when the producers start to take that to
heart. here's one for you to think about... of pira's rite-ie production gonna
be up 1-1.5 bcf by year end. does increased deliverabilty mean these winter
sprds in producing areas-ie jan-apr and the fact the mkts gonna be more
concerened about running out in march than in jan suggest big invererese will
not be sustainable but will happen only on a weather event??? be curoius your
thots-i maybe thinking too much but makes some sense to me-have a good weekend
johnny.
pira says decm 01 prod up 3 bcf y on y!

Hi John,

Destiny's Child is performing at the LiveStock & Rodeo Show on Sunday, Feb. 
18.  I have two little nieces who are huge fans.  I would love to take them 
to the show.

I was wondering if you could use your broker contacts for some really great 
seats( 4 to 8)(indivdual or in a suite) I'm more than willing to pay for the 
tickets.  

I'll take care of you down the road w/Rockets, Astros and Texan ticket!

Liz

Adam:
Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly 
identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I 
would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's 
happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the 
LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, 
the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I 
still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals 
and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  
The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  
It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Dear Mr. Arnold,

 It was nice to meet you yesterday at the
information session.  Thank you for the dinner last night.
I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in
a more relaxed setting.

 During out conversation yesterday, I was confused
about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of
your time on the phone with Traders in New York.  When
you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards
Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron
Online?  I think the underlying question that I am asking,
is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,
or is it meant to bypass traders completely.

Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward
to talking with you again when you come to campus for
interviews.

Cordially,

Adam

The positions went over limits due to the sale of HPL and subsequent unwind 
of hedges associated with the transaction.   Attempts are being made to 
unwind those positions currently

Mr. Shankman:

In preparation for the meeting on December 11th with Larry Kellner, CFO, 
Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the 
Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  We would 
appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.

Background:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year 
with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic 
Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader,  to review the strong 
business relationship in fuel management and travel services which  Enron has 
had with Continental Airlines.  Discussions were held as to how this 
relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.

A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both 
companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to 
expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in 
weather derivatives and plastics hedging.

December 11th Meeting Purpose:  Follow-up from October 25th meeting to 
specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th 
meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude:  (1) fuel management, 
(2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.

Location:  Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his 
availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor.  If he can make it for 
a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he 
is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 
Smith Street.  Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific 
preference?

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, 
we have coordinated through John Nowlan.  At the October 25th meeting,  Alan 
Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather 
derivatives opportunities, respectively.  

Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines  Enron's 
current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed 
initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging.  Larry 
Gagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing 
input on this.

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological 
$4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next 
sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with 
williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of 
the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common 
here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe 
in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some 
shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were 
trying to break $5.

   (Recasts, adds details)
    WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. electricity demand
will grow by about 2.3 percent in 2001, down from 3.6 percent
growth last year due to the nation's slowing economy, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday.
    Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent this
year, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report.
Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S.
electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal.
    U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was
forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIA
said. That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwh
forecast by the agency last month.
    For the entire winter heating season of October through
March, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent
from the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was driven
by the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecst
to be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively.
    More electricity plants were expected to switch from
natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, the
government report said.
    "This trend is expected to continue through the first
quarter 2001," the EIA said. "Although the favorable price
differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue
through the forecast period, by the second half of 2001,
expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keep
gas demand for power generation growing."
    The monthly report also said that mild weather has eased
natural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gas
supply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricity
plants.
    California has been fighting all winter to maintain

Jennifer,

I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably 
about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC:

Based on the following, I would say this:

1)  BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works, 
and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully.
2)  Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or 
acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore
3)  BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify 
what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works.
4)  I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any 
of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided 
any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works & EBS on 
11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for 
information relative to "what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation, 
Net Works?" from Net Works.
5)  So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by 
Net Works) than will be discussed, because
6)  Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions.  Period.

7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net 
Works' folks are concerned.

In the "I don't want any surprises" mode, I thought I'd give George a 
heads-up re:  possible fallout around the BMC thing.  I told George in this 
morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team ("I 
don't see a problem here..."), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and 
implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for "credit", which any ENE business 
unit could access, etc.  I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were 
likely to encourage Crowder to "lean on" Philippe (which I had recommended 
against).  George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Jeff

Here's the latest communication to Bruce Smith regarding Control-SA and
Control-M Windows 2000 certification, as well as reporting on the testing.
It's in the document, but to point it out, Control-SA is ready for
certification process on Dec of 2000 and Control-M on March 2001.

Would prefer a stand alone button as sometimes the problem is I can't operate 
stack manager.  I need the ability to force everybody out of the website so 
people don't try to click numbers that are old.  

On a similar topic, what's the status of the out of credit message?  Still a 
very frustrating problem for both counterparties and me.  

Do I need to follow up with Bradford about lowering sigma?

Grab me Thursday afternoon to talk.

I asked them to permission on your stack manager this function. You might 
want to have it as a stand alone icon on your desktop in case you can't 
operate stack manager.

When you have a second I'd like to talk about the broker EOL product and ED F 
Man.

Congrats on a big day. Total EOL gas volume was 425BcF (!!).

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel.  They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it.  Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you 
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with 
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your 
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's you 
bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?  what 
you charge me play against you?)

John,
As we discussed earlier, ENA HR is working with the A/A program to develop a 
process for placing sr. spec into associate titles.  Unfortunately, that 
process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.  
Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to 
interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.  

Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in 
similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to 
be held the first week of Jan.  I would like to handle all of these 
consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this 
discussion.  I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until 
after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the 
title change.  Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest 
convenience.  If you need my assistance with this please let me know.   I 
apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.  Please 
contact me with any questions/concerns.

Hawk vote for California firm unanimous 
Montgomery Watson pegged for water plant 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The Houston Area Water Corp. voted unanimously Monday to grant a $92 million 
contract to a California-based firm to design, build and operate a Lake 
Houston water plant. 
City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The 
administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery 
Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron 
Corp. 
The water corporation, known as "the Hawk," voted 5-0 to grant the contract. 
If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years 
to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. 
It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 
million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. 
The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, 
and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. 
The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 
when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to 
construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant 
expansion for $32 million. 
But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. 
The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a 
short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds 
itself. 
The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay 
the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant 
eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This 
plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could 
cost about $2 billion to implement. 
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure 
committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would 
focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three 
recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. 
Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and 
that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee 
this contract. 
The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. "In 
my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who 
will do it," Robinson said. 
The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been 
heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. 
Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new 
pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating 
Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council 
members to switch the contract to it. 
Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten 
work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the 
Hawk procedures as well. 
John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the 
first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman 
David Berg complaining of the "deleterious economic effect" on Azurix of the 
board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg 
answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the 
job. Berg didn't do so. 
Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of 
Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply 
indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. 
Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. 


		

		
		
		
		INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project 
Financial Times; May 15, 2001
By ROBIN ALLEN

		There are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or 
sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export 
scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. 
		Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is 
reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in 
which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. 
		However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of 
"selling" at least part of its shareholding. 
		The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit 
from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. 
		The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the 
United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu 
Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic 
political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a 
large-scale project, especially in the early stages. 
		Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu 
Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer 
on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to 
exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific 
North Field to Abu Dhabi. 
		Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron
's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to 
construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. 
		Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but 
one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas 
accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin 
Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. 
		"If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable" for western energy 
majors, asked one senior western diplomat, "then why are the serious US 
energy majors not involved?" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy

JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
"If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD 
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per 
year," Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.
Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that 
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy 
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. 
But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates. 
A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. 
Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market. 
Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998. 
These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. 
"The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California," 
Kean said. 
North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. 
In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. 
However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.

Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday. 
The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000.
However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies. 
"What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization 
in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable 
power supply significantly," said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the 
University of Tokyo. 
Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users. 
"There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly 
implement the liberalization," Hatta said. 
He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized. "If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity." 
Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. 
(ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward 
trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization. 
Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called "Reassessing Power 
Deregulation," which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. 

Hatta of the University of Tokyo said "it's very wise" that Japan has begun 
the deregulation with the "bilateral supply, or trade" system under which 
suppliers and users clinch deals directly. 
Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial 
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - 
is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial 
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. 
Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and 
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power 
providers, Hatta said. 
Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation 
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates 
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs 
are levied on prices. 
"There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices" nationwide, 
Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees 
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. 
Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) 
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. 
Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power 
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its 
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with "strong back-up" from the 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. 
"Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with 
power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select 
independent power providers," Omuro said.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.
By Cameron Dueck

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy 
giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign 
investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and 
bankers say. 
But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.
The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from 
country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity 
across Asia, they say. 
It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security 
offered by government payment guarantees. 
"Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an 
illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging 
market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be 
adversely affected because of it," said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP 
Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. 
Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion 
power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. 
MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by 
Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. 
The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the 
$48.2 million outstanding. 
The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to 
MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said 
Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. 
Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal 
governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. 
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES 
Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk 
before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital 
expenditure. 
Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. 
Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or 
even changes in market conditions. 
But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts 
said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient 
enough to back these agreements. 
Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in 
emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they 
said. 
"Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're 
even more so," said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in 
Singapore. 
"If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad." 
Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more 
pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy 
away from emerging Asian nations. 
"Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a 
properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to 
call in a government guarantee," Booth said.

Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is 
expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its 
choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas 
projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. 
The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee 
overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't 
completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers.
"Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some 
time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with 
recommendations from the technical committee," the sources said, according to 
the newspaper. 
However, the oil council "might endorse some balances concerning the offers," 
the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. 
Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be 
notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas 
projects. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement. 
After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil 
companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each 
project. 
The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar 
Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil 
Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E). 
For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, 
Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were 
shortlisted. 
And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were 
shortlisted.

MSEB refutes allegations by Enron, DPC
Girish Kuber

The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI 
THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron 
refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the 
political force majeure.
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political 
force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil 
its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond 
its control. 
MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political 
circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. 
"Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related 
security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our 
rights'," DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was 
uncalled for. 
For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events 
occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. 
MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. 
The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, 
which had been subjected to "concerted, deliberate and politically motivated 
actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which 
will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform 
obligations under PPA". 
"Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that 
the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for 
providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in 
protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights," the statement added. 
However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 
402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply 
electricity as per the agreement. 
MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 
and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on 
Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. 
MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 
213 crore.

Saudi Supreme Petrol Council meeting to decide on huge gas project bids

05/15/2001
Business Recorder
Copyright (C) 2001 Business Recorder; Source: World Reporter (TM)

RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings 
on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take 
a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. "The SPC has been 
discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and 
the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman 
al-Suhaibani told AFP. 
"It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final 
decision will be issued," added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The 
meetings began two weeks ago.
A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his 
firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. 
"The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were 
told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early 
next week," the executive told AFP. 
The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with 
the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding 
for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. 
The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. 
The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment 
in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in 
the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the 
Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. 
They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the 
world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. 
US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, 
Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been 
shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms 
BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. 
ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. 
The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up 
petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. 
The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out 
simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, 
the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the 
executive said. 
Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the 
current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven

Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of 
the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost 
its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.  
Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play 
that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more 
bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out 
below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy 
is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up.

John- 

What do you think of getting a direct mic from New York to Houston as soon as 
possible?  We had one at my last employer from NY to London which worked 
great.  You can tun it on or off but it allows us to communicate without 
getting on the darn phone - I am sure its a total annoyance to pick us up.

The steno is still a phone to me and its not recorded. 

We could keep it between you and Mike. 

We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them 
who will need quicker execution.  I know you and Per have discussed the idea 
of them calling you direct but I think, for now, the mic is a better answer.  
I can sit down with you when I am down there to discuss and give you an 
update of who we are planning to trade with.

Best Rgds,
Caroline

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel.  They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it.  Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

agree on view. as u cud tell i got a little less bearish for a bit so i delta
hedged and day traded to keep from losing a ton, let go og the delta after aga
number which was exactly on my forecast still implying 7.5 bcf swing(i 
actually
thot it could have been worse so my range pre was 5-12 basis past cupla weeks
aga. that said i with you took my lumps. having a very good month in petro
helped me hold on to natgas shit p&l. got most of it back now tho.trying to be
more patient.
    think we hold 5.20's  for another week or so-must be plenty chopped up
traders mite mean we lose some momentum for a bit.
    what the hell was going on today between you and bo(seems i see this more
and more)? how come he always seems to be fighting you on this stuff. if he
would go the same way as you(and i) this mkt would just crap. either way im
unwinding-gonna be making a jump soon(thats p&c for the moment). will keep u
informed of course.
  power gen up 3% last week and cal rate hikes the kiss of death for demand in

John,

Per your and Jeff's request, Research and Market Risk Groups have conducted 
an extensive analysis of the forward-forward vol methodology used in the 
Value-at-Risk calculation. 

We analyzed and compared two methodologies: 

 the existing methodology - based on forward (implied) vols
 an alternative methodology - based on historical vols

I would like to schedule about 30 minutes to walk you through the pros and 
cons of each methodology and get your input.

Vlady.

Hello:
A recent posting on the Enron bulletin board indicated that you are looking

please respond with details about the program, how old the kids are, the 
commitment required, etc.
Thanks,

Jennifer, I'm not so territorial that fire hydrants and trees are on my 
priority list, but I thought that I was doing my job OK on this.  If I read 
Crowder's FWD to Kim in a certain "tone", it appears to me that they feel I 
am overstepping.  I'm sure there is a better way for me to coordinate and 
facilitate these meetings, and do so in such a "tone" that Jim doesn't react 
the way I sense he did,  so I'll be coming to you to discuss, OK? 

On a lighter note (I hope), I hope your NY trip went well, and I'll see you 
tomorrow!

Thank you,

Jeff

Mission/Purpose:  Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below.  

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.  


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.  EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & 
marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.  I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Jeff

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't 
have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be 
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
possible alternates...

Thank you,

I'm in the process of booking the Avaya Briefing Center and need to know how

Mr. Thompson:

Thank-you for your time this morning as we reviewed progress on the=20
Kinko's/Enron relationship and discussed how we might move forward with the=
=20
appropriate individuals at Kinko's who could help us define "value=20
propositions."
=20
As we mentioned, we would like to have a conference call and/or meeting wit=
h=20
Kinko's "solutions architects" who could work with us on further defining =
=20
broadband and pulp & paper initatives.  If these discussions were held befo=
re=20
the holidays, this would enable us to prepare both for the Experience Enron=
=20
event which will be held January 5th, 2001 from 9-11 AM and for subsequent=
=20
executive level meetings.

For example, someone who could answer questions regarding communication=20
transit possibilities with kinkos.com and other broadband-related questions=
=20
would be helpful in this endeavor.  Often, this information comes to us=20
through the IT organization such as a direct report to the CIO or CTO.  =20
Additionally, someone from the Finance organization (direct report to the=
=20
CFO) could address the following types of questions regarding Kinko's paper=
=20
usage:

Of Kinko's overall costs, where does paper rank?
Does Kinko's have long-term (1-7 years), fixed pricing for copy paper?
Can Kinko's pass-through paper price increases on to its customers?

Mr. Thompson, I have taken the liberty of attaching the Meeting Minutes fro=
m=20
the October 6th meeting as background information of our discussions.

Thank-you for your help.  I can be reached at:  #(713)-345-6541 and look=20
forward to speaking soon.

Thanks for your help with the photographer.  I just heard from Ann Schmidt

Subject: Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - 1st Quarter 2001

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M =20


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
t=20
choices as much as possible. =20

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20
e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806=

Jennifer,

Can I get a contact from you for a representative at Hewlett-Packard.  I am 
needing to get in a 15" and an 18" LCD monitor to compare to other brands for 
the trading floors in the new building.

Thank you.

Ali,

The "Bridge" you referred to in your voice message to me is not the one you 
want, I believe.  You referred to a $5MM spend by Enron w/ "Bridge".  That 
spend data comes from the pre-SAP era, and may not be as accurate as one 
might hope.  In addition, you will find that the product/service category is 
"Hardware".  I am not sure that is the "Bridge" which Kathy Shaps is looking 
for the contract information (if any) on.  

That Bridge (Kathy's target, I believe) is the one which EBS has done a deal 
with (Bridge/Savvis/EBS, early summer '00; for WebFN)...Jeannette Busse & 
Greg Reynolds are intimately familiar with that customer relationship, but 
perhaps not at the contract level.  If it is and EBS-only relationship, EBS 
may have the only contract.  The EBS contracts contact would be Ray Stelly, 
who reports to Pat Weatherspoon (Ray is out until Monday the 11th, though).  
You might also check with Richard Weeks, who could direct you to the right 
person in EBS purchasing, if it's a "buy on PO" situation.

http://www.bridge.com/

http://www.webfn.com/cgi-bin/core.dll?i9=267&s144=index.txt&sfront=1&slogin=0&
sframeBust=undefined

Please check the URLs above, and if they take you to the company with the 
"Enron relationship" you're referring to, I'll have a better idea what to 
look for.  In the meantime, I am looking into our contracts area to see what, 
if any, contracts that GSS has active (for any part of Enron) with any 
company called "Bridge", whether it is Bridge Information Systems, or some 
other "Bridge".  When I have more information, I'll call and/or e-mail you 
with an update.  I'll also copy Kathy and Kim.

Thank you,

Jeff

Happy to work for the greater good, but would welcome your help in nailing a 
deal with Continental quickly, as my understanding is that they have been 
unresponsive to date.

We have a number of key initiatives in process with Continental including 
sales of broadband services, weather derivatives and facility management that 
have the potential to exceed the savings being offered by British Airways.  I 
would prefer that we stay the course with Continental plus I am confident 
that Continental can either meet or exceed BA's current offer.

George,

Enron Europe has negotiated a preferred supplier agreement with British 
Airways which will save us circa $3m a year vs Continental Airlines. I know 
there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me 
know if this causes you a problem. Colin Bailey is in Houston next week if 
you need or want to know any of the detail.

Jennifer,
I just spoke with Lee Jackson, Enron Plastics and Petrochemicals, in regard 
to Universal Studios.  He did not feel Universal's plastic spend would be in 
the range their group would consider for a prospect.  Lee said their main 
clients are chemical companies/producers.  He mentioned a typical usage would 
be 1 Billion Lbs/yr in polymers and  5-10 MM Lbs/year in polymers large 
users.  

I also briefly mentioned EP&P possibly coming to do an overview training for 
us.  I mentioned this to Sarah-Joy and she said she would schedule something 
through Alan Engberg beginning next year.

So, what is it?   And by the way, don't start with the excuses.   You're 
expected to be a full, gourmet cook.

Remember we were trying to figure out the difference in return between tax 
free investment growth and annually-taxed investment growth?  Turns out that 
it is different, but over 5 years and a 10% growth rate, it doesn't amount to 
much more than the cost of our beer tab.  See attached.

The guy from MG whom I spoke to about clearing was Alfred Pennisi, VP of 
Operations.  He's out of NY.   He indicated his clearing costs were $3.10 
versus the $4.50-5.00 I'm paying now.

I was long 4000 X @ 4902, then I switched it from X to F at the same price.  
I switched it at 5000, but it puts me into the F at a price basis of 4902.  
Sorry for the confusion.

Hey:
I just want to confirm the trades I have in your book.
Trade #1.  I sell 4000 X @ 4652

Trade #2. I buy 4000 X @ 4652
  I sell 4000 X @ 4902

Trade #3 I buy 4000 X @ 5000
  I sell 4000 F @ 5000


Net result: I have 4000 F in your book @ 4902.
Thanks, 
John

I know it will be close to impossible to get out but I wanted to invite you 
to our Christmas party on Dec 20 here in NYC- we'd love if you came.  If not, 
in the new year, I hope we can set something up where you meet some of the 
new funds we are dealing and have some fun up here.

I met someone good to work with you guys at this last Super Saturday- David 
Larson- Berkeley- good derivatives, trading knowledge, personable.  I'll fax 
through resume- we are making him an offer for the analyst pool.

Thanks for all you help always,
Caroline

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

Matt,
I have spoken with Mark who is part of the GSS organization and we are going 
to pursue this after the first of the year.  Mark has a relationship with the 
President of Requisite and we will be having a meeting with him to discuss 
opportunity.

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Thanks.

Subject: Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - 1st Quarter 2001

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
t=20
choices as much as possible. =20

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20
e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806=
.

Thank you.

Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for hosting a brown bag lunch session yesterday; your presentation 
was very informative and I believe it led to greater understanding of 
Business Development within GSS.  On a personal level, I was very interested 
in your Continental deal and would like to read a white paper or postmortems 
analysis of the deal after it closes.

I also thank you for taking an active role in this mornings' brown bag, I 
felt like it lent additional credibility to Experience Enron and answered the 
inevitable "what's in it for me" questions.

Sincerely,
Jim Wininger

I have heard that  our=01;Byron Gaddis was trying to reach you=01; about an=

ideas you might  have for large structural parts (remember out titanium
casting capability for  jet engine turbine blades as well as generator

In any case... we  definitely want to make sure PCC Ball Valves is your

How are we doing to  get that distinction?

i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late 
morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point on 
v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on 
value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between 
hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 
cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet that's what it is 
worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3.  The 
same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will be exceptionally 
strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year.  But cal 2 will 
lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are selling right now because 
every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 
will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j 
blow out.  After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h 
again.  my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will 
be under some pressure.  i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it 
either way though.

you got me wrong-i wanna sell oct buy nov forward. look-two scenarios med 
longer
term. we inject like mad early summer-economy stays crappy the frot of the 
curve
gets slaughtered.-oct/nov goes to 3 cts sometime between now and end sep
   scenario 2-they dont enject what they want-oct /nov wil stay tite between 
say
3-and 10 cts like this year but man after this winter they will panic at some
point and buy the hell out of the winter strip and blow out oct /nov to 30 cts
cuz they panic. to me if that one was to ever backwardate it was this 
summer-low
low stx and injections and they still blew out cuz they panicked about 
winter-as
we see this winter now for good reason..?? capeche? i thinkit a win win

 you still in the damn mar/apr-i only sold a little prenumber-cant beleive how
this got killed after-what changed?? from 1:30 to 2:05

Hey freak:
So we finally had LA type weather here for the past two days.  Highs in the 
mid-70's.  Beautiful.  Life's just cruising along.  Nothing new.  I put a bid 
in for a condo in a new mid-rise building going up in West U that they 
accepted.  If all goes as expected I'll move in next X-Mas.  So are you 
adjusting to the big city.   Got yourself a big Hollywood actor boyfriend yet?

Hey Adam:
sorry for the delay.  just been very busy.  congrats on joining enron.  think 
you made the right chioce.  i would recommend structuring.  it's a good way 
to understand how enron works, how we look at and manage risk, and you get 
close to the trading component.  a friend of mine, ed mcmichael runs the gas 
structuring group.  try emiling him probably at emcmich@enron.com.  keep in 
touch,
john

Hi John,

I hope your gas markets are moving nicely this week.  Its
been a long time since we talked, but a lot has happened.
But the most important thing has been my decision to join
Enron. At this point, I am looking around for a rotation,
and I have received a lot of advice pointing me towards
Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations.  I am wondering if
you know some people in these areas who might be looking
for analysts.  I have heard that traders work closely with
the structured finance and RAC guys, true?  If you have
time please let me know if you know of anything.

Thanks,

Adam Bayer

John:
?
The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing.? My 
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural 
appears to be waning at present.? Volume on this rally is  poor, particularly 
since yesterday was a decent day to the upside.? The  market appears to be 
using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels.? If  we are at these same 
price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely  bullish.? Right 
here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great.?  Recommend a neutral 
stance short-term on natural.? Bigger picture is still  very bullish.? 
However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of what I would  call horizontal 
price action to set the stage for a big move to the  upside.
?
Let me know if this stuff is useful for you.? I certainly  don't want to 
waste your time.? In addition, if you prefer I call when I  have something to 
pass along, let me know.? I don't know how often you  check/see your e-mail.? 
Thanks,
?

Let me know when will be good for both you and John on next Wednesday
afternoon. Right now only you and myself have been added into the NT group.
After the demo, if both of you think it is a great tool, then I am going to
add all traders into the NT group, so they can use it.

John,

I heard from Wes Colwell that you had been appointed by Lavorato to layout 
the sixth floor for gas.  This morning I spoke to Wes regarding the placement 
of the Upstream/Ecommerce desk on six.  I have taken 6 spaces but I need two 
more.  The two I would like to use (e29 & e30) are currently being occupied 
by the Central Region.  I would like to move these individuals to two spots 
right across from their current location (e35 & e36).


For your information, the current six spots that I have are :  e17, e18, e21, 
e22, e23 and e24.

Please call when you can.  Good luck trading...

Regards, Mrha

Jeff,

The value that we are looking for is the annual spend from ENA (trading 
floor) to have each trader access the Bridge Information System or Bridge 
Terminal.  We believe that Enron would get this backbone connectivity from 
Savvis.   This information is supplied by Bridge and has nothing to do with 
the WebFN transaction done by EBS.   Any thoughts on where we can find the 
annunal spend by ENA to gain access to the Bridge Terminals and their 
information - we thought that GSS might have the annual spend numbers.   

thanks for your help,

Kim

By the way, by the time I arrived home it was completely dark so I went for a

BUT, it's all your fault I couldn't go last night....he!he!

Obviously most bearish the further out you go.  However, the game right now 
is not sell and hold...although it will be soon.  The game is where will it 
be tomorrow and next week and next month.  The market is structurally short 
term gas thanks to our friends from california.  where ca is buying power, 
williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 450 or 475 or 500

or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years.

your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our
customer biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell
blood among the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant
see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right
now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at
this level though.

Mike- I have their trader coming into the office tomorrow- they are a macro 
fund (they manage Harvard's endowment fund) that trades commodities- mostly 
crude and metals.  I want to get them into some gas and power trades.  
Specifically, I want to get them into the short Rockies trade for the summer 
that we have Tudor in.  

Johnny recommended I have you speak to them- can you give me a few minutes 
during the day to talk to them about the west in general.

I have him in all day- we are sitting with Mike Roberts to do the weather 
update from 6 am-7:30 - would be great if we could get you between 7:30 and 
8:30 am.  If not, let me know when is good- Ina will know where I am

Steve/Chaz - 

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point.  

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc.  In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the 
"accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Your 
note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

I will call you to follow up on this note.

Thank you,

Jeff Youngflesh

Average volume is 35,000-40,000 on nymex of which about half is spreads.  So 
around 20,000 outrights trade.  We trade more than that on EOL.  Today's 
conditions 1000 lot market would be 3-4 cents wide.  have executed trades as 
large as 10,000 across a longer term and 1000 lot clips in the front 
frequently.

Subject: SUNRISE CAPITAL

This is a program trader in San Diego with about 1 Billion in Capital.  They 
concentrate on front month trading- both swaps and options.  they are looking 
for liquidity and want to know:

1. size of the financial markets- what is the daily trading volume like?
2. bid/offer on size.. like 10,000 to start and then 5,000..1,000 - only for 
the front month on swaps and options?
3. what kind of size we have seen go through directly from anyone?

They want to know this for nat gas: I can talk to John and Mike on this
Rus- can you please get this on WTI, heat, and unleaded.

I want to try to get this to them today... we'll be getting a lot of these 
inquiries.

Also, they trade through Carr futures, Merrill, Morgan Stanley, and 
JPM/Chase.. What they want to do is trade with us and then we'll give-up the 
trades to the above counterparties.. in effect, we will not have any credit 
exposure..I can explain this in our meeting.

Thanks,

The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.   It is
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.   Chief of
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.  I run the
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.

I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.   Never been
but heard it's beautiful.  Next time you're in we'll go out.

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best
part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends
in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City
on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to
be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??
I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

Glad to see you're having so much fun with this.  I've been here 5.5 years
with nothing and then in one week I'm in Fortune and Time.  Pretty funny.
Things are going well here .  The big E just chugging along, bringing the

Saudis Set to Select Firms for Gas Projects

NEW YORK -- After more than two years of talks, Saudi Arabia is about to 
announce its choice of international oil companies for three huge natural-gas 
projects that will mark a reopening of the kingdom's energy sector to Western 
investment, a quarter century after it was nationalized. 
But the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early 
next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for 
the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion. 
It will be months before final agreements are signed.
"We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at 
the end of the year, or, hopefully, the first quarter of next year," said 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi in an interview last week. 
Saudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today 
to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. In the following week, Saudi Arabia 
is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides 
of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects. By the 
end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are 
expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects. This will 
be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter, 
has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest 
reserves of natural gas. 
As with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound. All 
three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group 
and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the 
plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose 
environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas. The Ghawar project, 
known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in 
investment. Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast. The third project is in 
Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a 
southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates. 
The companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or 
who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil, 
Shell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental 
Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum 
Corp. -- to lead each project. But they all have their hopes. 
"We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator" for the 
Shaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive. 
Since Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to 
the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues 
as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration 
and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as 
well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their 
investment. 
Soon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as 
the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals 
company Saudi Basic Industries Corp.

Cheney task force seeks input from interest groups
By SHARON THEIMER
Associated Press Writer

05/14/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has 
met with more than 130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions 
often at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private 
sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney. 
The vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force 
have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage 
a free exchange of ideas.
The White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to 
Congress. 
But interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse 
interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist. 
Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants 
such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both 
GOP donors. 
Houston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and 
electricity. 
"The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have 
a huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work 
through our associations to the extent we can," said Don Duncan, vice 
president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co. 
Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included 
about a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and 
staff. 
No details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarized 
the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background 
and proposals. Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their 
priorities. 
At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove 
and Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey, nuclear energy executives tried to 
make sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over 
the past few years. At one point, Rove asked if anyone was looking to build a 
nuclear power plant. An executive with Exelon replied that his company was 
thinking about it, meeting participants said. 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one 
with Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California 
with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done 
little to help the power-strapped state. 
Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's 
power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it 
and possible solutions. 
"They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever 
affecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation," Davis 
spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "I think it demands more attention than a 
one-page memo." 
Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been 
studying the California problem almost daily. 
At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in 
late April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined 
national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals. 
"I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that 
coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when 
the plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help 
martial this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United 
Mineworkers Union. 
White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage 
lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was 
permissible under federal law. 
Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California 
Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca 
Mountain federal nuclear waste site. The vice president plans to meet with 
the renewable-energy industry this week. 
Enron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving 
more than $110,000, and helped sponsor a $7 million party fund-raiser last 
month. 
The Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds 
of its $193,000 in contributions last year. Edison International, whose 
holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a 
major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to 
Democrats. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because the 
power wholesaler is a respected member of the industry, not because it was a 
contributor. Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity 
transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new 
transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he 
said. 
Tom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is "totally ludicrous" to think 
political donations played a role. 
Cheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's 
invitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Cheney spoke about the task 
force process, Kuhn said. He said Cheney's remarks were consistent with the 
vice president's public statements. 
Edison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built, including 
coal, natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power, Kuhn said. 
Democrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings, but 
Cheney's office responded by only listing broad categories and no names. That 
has left fodder for political attack. 
"You can't just take advice from one interest group or set of interest groups 
when you do these things," said Dave Albersworth of the Wilderness Society, 
whose group has met with Lundquist but was denied its request to talk with 
Cheney. 
Weiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from 
more than 130 groups since January in an "almost Herculean effort" to draw 
input from all sides. 
"People deserve the right to petition their government and not expect a full 
laundry list of who's called to be announced," she said. 
Enron spokesman Palmer said he is not seeking such privacy. "I'm happy to 
tell people what we're advocating for. I'd rather be talking about policy 
than about politics," he said.

		COMPANIES & FINANCE UK: Independents drill deep to strike rich seams: A new 
generation of smaller oil companies is emerging; a group that has discovered 
how to be competitive, writes David Buchan: Financial Times; May 14, 2001
By DAVID BUCHAN

		The UK's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number. But they can 
rightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective 
demise are exaggerated. 
		Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed 
"independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing, 
believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating 
in the North Sea 30 years ago. 
		After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo, 
there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left. Yet 
they amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significant 
exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden. 
		Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in 
the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to 
consortia with a local flavour. 
		But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more 
free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the 
same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British 
Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil. Enterprise is the only UK independent 
that is more than a niche or regional player. As such its E&P assets would be 
a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured 
interest in taking it over. 
		As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based 
independents began to look elsewhere. "Unlike US independents which have 
always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those 
in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the 
world", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood. 
		Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in 
the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union. One company, Ramco Energy, 
dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in 
the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m). 
		Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into 
Russia and got stuck. While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because 
it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam 
operations. Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a 
country notorious for non-payment of energy bills. With diplomatic help from 
Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob 
it of its Ukraine assets. 
		Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia. "Cairn Energy 
now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would 
be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest 
foreign player in India," says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg. Premier Oil is now a 
substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and 
Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore. 
		But there are risks in these Asian ties. The obvious political one concerns 
Burma. Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its 
presence was helping the military regime. Premier refused, and said it would 
carry on. 
		The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to 
Cairn. Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are 
"very dependent on the strength of the local economies". But then, Mr Redway 
is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in 
exploration rather than production. He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas 
highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector". 
		Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end. Its 
goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap 
exploration for production assets. "This avoids the expensive development 
stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on". Then at the other end 
of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil 
or Venture Production. Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no 
bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings 
overlooked by the majors. 
		The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil 
price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and 
sellers. 
		But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is 
this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is 
selling off. 
		As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company 
with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not 
exploration. And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort 
Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years. This new 
generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one. 
"Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value," 
says one executive. 
		The other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock 
market. "By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in 
terms of cash flow and earnings," says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance 
director.

QATAR: UAE's Dolphin may seek new partners if Enron exits.
By Kedar Sharma

05/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DOHA, May 14 (Reuters) - Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) may invite new foreign 
investors to join its project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates 
as U.S. Enron Corp looks set to bow out, industry sources said on Monday. 
"New partners are a possibility," Khaldoun al-Mubarak, project manager for 
DEL, majority owned by the UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), told Reuters.
"But at the moment we are in the midst of finalising the formal (development 
and production sharing) agreement with Qatar which should be done by 
September at the latest." 
Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which 
outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5 
billion project. 
UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by 
France's TotalFinaElf and Enron. 
"Enron is going through major global restructuring," Mubarak said. "(But) 
they haven't officially notified us about their intention to pull out." 
Enron officials declined comment. 
Mubarak said interest in DEL was running high. 
"Everyone is asking for a stake," he said. 
The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North 
Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas. 
UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and 
setting up production facilities. 
The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up 
receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. 
First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or 
early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be 
consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi with the remainder supplied to Dubai.

UAE: UPDATE 1-Saudi expected to name gas race winners on Tuesday.
By Peg Mackey

05/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DUBAI, May 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is 
expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its 
multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with 
the negotiations said on Monday. 
The sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell 
as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's 
upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation 
in 1975.
Signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place 
in early June, the sources said. 
The anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's 
gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its 
energy investment opening over two years ago. 
But the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas 
sector, the world's fourth biggest. "The fiscal regime and regulatory details 
have not been developed," said one source. 
FINAL CUT 
Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential 
foreign investors revealed last summer. Those companies had been grouped 
under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah. 
For ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi 
Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the 
biggest slice of the projects, analysts said. 
Other industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company, 
was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in 
core venture 2 (Red Sea). 
Royal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the 
sources added. 
Both oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the 
kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said. 
ENERGY DRIVERS 
An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's 
landmark energy opening. 
And analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve 
those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low. 
"Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity," a source said. "The 
gas projects will show profits." 
But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and 
electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen. 
On paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for 
impressive growth. 
Domestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is 
forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade. 
Saudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's 
biggest, remains off limits. 
Even so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil, 
the kingdom's lifeblood. 
"The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate 
objective," a regional analyst said. 
"Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually 
they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the 
majors." 
The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the 
kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed 
by gas supplies, such as power and desalination. 
The following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects: 
Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP , 
TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI . 
Core venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron
/Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell. 
Core venture 3 (Shaybah Area) - Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon, 
Conoco, TotalFinaElf, Phillips and Enron/Oxy.

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- International oil companies vying for a stake in Saudi 
Arabia's downstream gas projects, expect to be notified soon on whether they 
have been selected to participate, industry sources in the kingdom said 
Monday. 
Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council is set to meet Tuesday and shortly 
after, announce its final selection for each of the three core ventures on 
offer, the sources said.
The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with international oil companies on 
the Gas Initiative, submitted its proposals for consortium members and 
leaders to the country's Ministerial Council in April. These were then passed 
on to the SPC for final approval. 
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who heads the SPC, is in Bahrain Monday 
attending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders' summit along with Saudi 
Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, who heads the gas negotiating 
committee. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement. 
After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the 
past year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project. 
Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron 
Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1, 
the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development. 
For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, 
Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed. 
And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were 
listed. 

With all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and 
essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to 
lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after, 
industry sources said. 
Exxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture. 
The operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be 
responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which 
will lead to final deals probably by year end. 
Also, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's 
individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't 
finalized, sources said. 
The three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25 
billion.

Business
RFID chip will help speed up business

05/14/2001
The New Straits Times
Main/Lifestyle; 2*

THE combination of recently developed "stick-on" Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP) 
will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas 
industry. 
And Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning.
Global management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice 
which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this 
idea locally. 
Global Energy Strategy Practice partner Paul Spence said that applying this 
latest combined technology, car owners can fill up a petrol tank without 
resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card. 
Relevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and 
the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science 
fiction movie. 
This surreal development is made possible through the application of 
ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate 
with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence. 
Such technology is economically available today. "There are technology 
suppliers who are offering these capabilities." 
The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry. 
Communications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals 
to restricted zones. 
In an interview in Petaling Jaya recently, Spence said: "A lot of my clients 
now are asking, whether that same technology can be used to restrict access 
into hazardous areas, plants or production sites. 
"Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant? There 
are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that." 
"Guru in the field" is another potential application where a combination of 
RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal 
computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site. 
"An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype 
mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other 
side of the world. 
"The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity 
markets is to lock them in tighter correlation. 
"The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets 
are shortening within the energy industry. Enron which is the biggest oil 
trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives." 
Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and 
gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to 
remain connected to global markets.

India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation

05/14/2001

Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is 
expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15. 
While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power 
purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is 
expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, 
sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate 
with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon 
meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report.
"The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB," a source said. 
"The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and 
transmission." While generation and transmission can be controlled by the 
State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5 
lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the 
board into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due 
to fear of privatisation. 
MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to 
delay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is 
expected to address the problem in detail. 
Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: "...none of the 
solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in 
particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its 
distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report." 
The report is expected to "suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the 
interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of 
Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and 
safeguarded," according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the 
committee. 
The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr 
E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay 
Mohan Lal. The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of 
the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of 
negotiations with Enron.

The Smart Investor
Tertiary will be primary

These are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters 
that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies. 
Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a 
bout of slightly lower growth. 
But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the 
region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP 
grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank.
Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the 
prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per 
cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest 
performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up 
the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural 
performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard. 
However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from 
a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to 
see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon. 
An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And, 
they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move. 
Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange 
reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian 
currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of 
control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil 
prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut 
may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector, 
stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon. 
Rain, rain, come again 
For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP 
level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year. 
"According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by 
around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J 
M Morgan Stanley Securities. 
In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a 
subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a 
row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent 
compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for 
only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by 
economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because 
of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption 
side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research 
Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries," 
he adds. 
More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on 
agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for 
everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like 
tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good 
monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent. 
In service of the economy 
Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services. 
India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to 
transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth 
weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this 
important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most 
economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge 
slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that 
overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry 
numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it 
will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan. 
Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and 
other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7 
per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to 
show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking 
Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies. 
Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax 
reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more 
people to buy houses. 
Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services, 
says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the 
world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing, 
though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money 
spinners in the years ahead. 
The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment. 
"The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth 
rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100 
Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone. 
A good home show 
And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the 
gloom over its performance. 
Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest 
rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy 
increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year. 
While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is 
that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at 
which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven 
per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale 
price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices 
will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to 
exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the 
industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on 
rural demand. 
Neighbours' envy 
And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact 
of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to 
remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are 
less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to 
shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian 
nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand. 
With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is 
clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP 
comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the 
Philippines. 
Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports 
remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20 
per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of 
good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same 
period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per 
cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from 
$12.79 billion the previous year. 
Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American 
slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a 
quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70 
per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important 
software exports destination. 
Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living 
overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on 
India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic 
turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill 
threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from 
invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to 
the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit. 
It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of 
Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to 
between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion. 
Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from 
$6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression. 
"They are still talking about growth. It is a decline in the growth rate and 
not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive 
officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to 
maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who 
live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment," 
says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months 
to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same 
period. 
Foreign institutions support 
Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too. 
Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's 
equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the 
whole of calendar 2000. 
Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months, 
investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and 
seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios, 
some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say. 
Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see 
India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band. 
Yet some hesitation 
Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government 
opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including 
pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence. However, 
tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India. 
In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the 
previous year to $2.4 billion. Yet, China a market India is frequently 
compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in 
the same period. Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start 
investment in the country. "It's a pittance and it probably will remain 
stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house. 
The reasons are not hard to find. Foreigners seeking to invest in India have 
many fences to cross. Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic 
infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often 
left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India. 
The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring 
concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power 
project in Dabhol in Maharashtra. After being forced to renegotiate a power 
supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines 
once again. 
This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay 
its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its 
commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation 
that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply 
pull out of the project altogether. A disturbing turn of events, since, till 
recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India. 
It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign 
investor to pull out of a project. Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had 
also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing 
endless bureaucratic hurdles. 
And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300 
million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly. Many 
international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up 
operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market. Now many are struggling to 
break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for 
success. That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors, 
India still remains a tough sell. 
Outlook 
With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six 
per cent. Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget 
could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy. Strong 
measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment. These 
are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run. 
The recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment, 
although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable. Still, every 
bit helps. The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to 
accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic 
powerhouse are to be realised. After all, for the second most populous nation 
in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still 
nowhere near the figure its size suggests.

Italian brokers Rasfin SIM have indicated the potential for growth in the 
shares of Acegas, the former municipal utility of the Italian city of 
Trieste. Acegas closed the first quarter of this year with turnover of L137bn 
(+45 per cent). Results attributed in part to the start of production of 
Estenergy, a consortium of the utilities of Udine, Trieste, Gorizia and Enron 
of the US, which supplies energy and services to parts of Friuli. 
Also significant, according to Rasfin, were investments over the period, 
which totalled L43bn.

Sometimes even Cabinet officers can lose their way in the White House. So 
there was Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, clearly lost 
Friday at a fork in a corridor near White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's 
office. 
"How do you get to the Oval Office?" he asked a group of reporters and was 
directed to the right door, according to a wire report.
Fleischer, though, told reporters that was the wrong answer. 
"How do you get to the Oval Office? First you win the Iowa caucus, then you 
lose the New Hampshire primary, then you make a comeback in South Carolina," 
he quipped as he recalled President Bush's early primary campaign last year. 
Passport, Please 
Meanwhile, folks at Thompson's HHS may be taking to calling him "Tightwad 
Tommy." Seems a memo went out March 15 undermining Alaska and Hawaii's claims 
to be part of the United States. 
Employees "must clear . . . international travel" with the office of the 
deputy chief of staff for operations, said the memo from the deputy chief, Ed 
Sontag. To clarify, "HHS employees seeking to travel outside the continental 
U.S." for meetings and conferences, must get permission and then file trip 
reports within two weeks. 
This sent officials calling around, asking whether trips to those states were 
to go through the international travel approval system just as if they were 
going to Russia or the Congo. 
Apparently so. The edict would appear to include even the nearby Virgin 
Islands and practically next-door Puerto Rico as well. Loop Fans can only 
hope this outrage doesn't spread to other agencies. It would make for some 
cold winters. 
Chewing Out on the Bush Beat 
Speaking of Fleischer, the usually affable spokesman is not reluctant to get 
tough with reporters when he believes they've stepped out of line. 
Sheriff Fleischer was on duty Thursday and upset with Houston Chronicle 
reporter Bennett Roth. Bush that morning urged parents to talk more to their 
kids about the dangers of drugs. 
Roth, at Fleischer's daily briefing, asked: "Ari, the president talked about 
parental involvement today. How much has he talked to his own daughters about 
both drugs and drinking? And given the fact that his own daughter was cited 
for underage drinking, isn't that a sign that there's only so much effect 
that a parent can have on their children's behavior?" 
Fleischer responded brusquely: "No, I think, frankly, there are some issues 
where I think it's very important for you all in the press corps to recognize 
that he is the president of the United States; he's also a father. And the 
press corps has been very respectful in the past of treating family matters 
with privacy, and I'm certain that you're going to do so again. I hope so." 
Fleischer later called Roth to chastise him, telling him his question had 
been "noted in the building." 
Competing to Oversee the Corps 
Former Mississippi representative Mike Parker, a Democrat-turned-Republican 
who lost a gubernatorial bid a couple of years back, had been seen as the 
pick to be assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, overseeing the 
Army Corps of Engineers. 
Parker, a former undertaker, had support from the barge industry, the various 
corps constituencies and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott, the majority leader 
of the Senate. 
But the Pentagon's choice was Lawrence Izzo, recently retired president of 
Enron Engineering and Construction Co. who has been in the mix for several 
jobs. Izzo, a West Point grad, had 23 years at the Corps before going to 
Enron, former home of Army secretary-designate Thomas White. 
The majority leader was said to be most unhappy. The latest word is Parker's 
getting the job. 
Ex-Reporters Move On 
Kenneth J. Klein, a former reporter who has worked for 17 years for Florida 
Sen. Bob Graham (D), most recently as chief of staff, is joining the Outdoor 
Advertising Association of America as executive vice president for government 
relations. 
Former Washington Post colleague Thomas W. Lippman, a 33-year national, 
foreign and financial reporter and author who became vice president of 
communications at the World Wildlife Fund in 1999, is moving next month to be 
managing director at communications consulting firm Chlopak, Leonard, 
Schechter & Associates.

Largest LNG 13 Conference Opens Today

05/14/2001
Korea Times
Copyright (C) 2001 Korea Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

The largest-ever International Conference and Exhibition on liquefied natural 
gas (LNG 13) opens today for a four-day run at the Convention and Exhibition 
Center (COEX) in southern Seoul. 
A total of 125 companies and organizations represented by 2,500 delegates and 
exhibitors from 50-odd countries, including Japan, the United States, Britain 
and Australia, are participating in the international event, co- organized by 
the Korea Gas Union and the Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS).
Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Che-shik will be delivering 
congratulatory remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Han-dong who is 
currently on an official trip to the Middle East. There will be a visual 
presentation from Lee during the opening ceremony. 
``We have spent more than a year preparing for this international event which 
is the largest in terms of the number of participants and exhibitors,'' said 
Lee Seung-hwan, chairman of the Korean National Organizing Committee. 
LNG 13 is 15 percent larger than the conference and exhibition held in 
Australia back in 1998 which reflects the growth of the industry, Lee 
explained, adding that the demand for LNG has been increasing rapidly here in 
Korea. 
A wide range of topics will be presented during the four days of conferences 
and exhibitions, helping to showcase the importance of the LNG industry. 
Among the numerous papers to be presented at the triennial event are ``Old 
World, New World, Tomorrow's World: How LNG Has Changed Since LNG 12'' and 
``The Next Generation of LNG Plants.'' 
``Hosting this meaningful event in Korea will help elevate Korea's image in 
the international market, particularly with the sheer scale and size of LNG 
13,'' said Kim Myung-kyu, president and CEO of KOGAS and chairman of the 
Korea gas Union. 
The conference will include paper sessions, workshops, poster sessions and 
film presentations while exhibitors will demonstrate their exclusive 
technologies for the exploration and production of LNG as well as plant 
construction. 
The official sponsors of LNG 13 are the International Gas Union, the Gas 
Technology Institute and the International institute of Refrigeration while 
the major sponsors are Shell Gas and Power, KOGAS, LG-Caltex, SK-Enron, the 
Qatari Group, TotalFinaElf, British Petroleum and Exxon Mobile. 
In addition to the conference and exhibition, there will be a technical visit 
to the Inchon LNG Receiving Terminal in Inchon, about 50 kilometers west of 
Seoul, on Friday.

John, is access to the board on a password basis now? If so, when you get a 
chance could you authorise access for myself and Andew Hill (a colleague in 
crude fundamentals) please? A similar board for crude and products should be 
ready within a couple of weeks. Thanks

Alex

Hey:
Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  
Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.  
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.   
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a 
very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they 
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some 
back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 
considering the scenario that's being painted.

johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for
me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled 
all
the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas
therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was 
long
mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early
  flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a
flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained
aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.

   but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to 
mark
silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no
idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. 
any
great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.
   guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling 
dry
up??

Jeff:
To explain the P&L of -349,000  : 
We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing 
in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back 
rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  
The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is 
pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and 
vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.

Looking out for you bubbeh:
John

Jennifer,

I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one.  I 
did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to 
Jenny and Bob McAuliffe.  When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's 
retraction.  It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very 
"customer-focused" on BMC's part.  I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to 
the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!

Not that it matters but wanted you to know:
BMC rep left message recanting the fact that we would still have the 45 % 
discount if SAP modules were purchased at some other time.  He states now 
that if not purchased now the discount would only be 10-20 % range at a later 
date.

Subject: BMC DEAL 
Importance: High

Jenny/Bob

Per the BMC deal, here is where we are with Batch Processing:

TidalSoft, Sysadmiral
Approx.  90 k  ( current quote covers us and GPG and does not include SAP ) 
We have added a couple of pieces to this and it could bring the cost to 125 k 
worst case.  This quote covers consulting and maintenance.  They are trying 
very hard to get a deal done this year  and we could probably get our 
additional components at the current quote price if we signed.  

BMC, Control -M
Approx. 325 k   This is after we remove the SAP modules and components from 
the quote. Quote that was sent over from Jeff Youngflesh (Enron GSS) was for 
a total of 628 k

Hardware for either product is approx. 300 k. 

We have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to take 
over their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our long 
term strategy. They actually do not recommend either of these product's SAP 
modules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectors 
into BMC.  We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft 
(Larry if you have info on this please comment).

Larry's and his team have eval'd both products and although they are leaning 
towards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable.  You 
guys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight it 
will lend to the EBS/BMC deal.  FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45% 
discount if we cut the SAP modules.  BMC needs to sit down with PB and learn 
how over priced their products are !

Let me know what you think.  If we go TidalSoft I need to push this through 
or be advised to let it go till the New Year.

Thanks
Bruce


*****
Also in Quote sent over from Youngflesh :
BMC, Control SA
1.3 M     NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME  - Is a candidate for future 
consideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculate 
as to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS.   I guess they put 
this quote together from info they received from Henry Moreno

Jennifer - just wanted to give you a quick SAP update - we have some traction 
still with them. We are going to provide them with a proposal for the 
4-eurpoean cities mentioned during the last conference call. On the low-end 
it is a $2.09M deal with the high-end (lower probability) could be $8M-plus.

We hope to have firms numbers to them late next week. We also had a conf-call 
with Commerce One that did not go well with respect to bandwidth, however we 
are still going to pursue the reseller potential with them for next quarter.

Here is the name of an available options trader:
Jeremy Sorkin
VP, Deutsche Bank
713 757 9200

Would fit Enron culture, but have had little contact with him professionally.
Might be worth bringing him in.   Tell me if you want me to call him.

Catherine:
Sorry it's been so long since I could respond.  With the craziness here I am 
way behind on everything.
#1. 3 years
#2.  volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility.  volume 
probably averaging 25000 these days.  EOL volume averaging around 14000.   
Very high percent of market.   Current market conditions shows why our 
transactional model of being one side of every trade is superior.  
#3.  good liquidity first 3 years.  okay liquidity years 4-6.
#4.  calendar 2004-2008 maybe 1 trade a day.  70% chance Enron is one side.  
calendar 2009-2013  very rare that it trades.

Per my voicemail, I've included a list of the Investors' questions and 
preliminary answers.  The answers are attempts by our group, Bob Crane and 
Bryon Hoskins but need confirmation by you.  Would you mind giving us some 
feedback for #4 as well?  I could not find these numbers.  These are again 
going to be forwarded to Bain Capital, the potential equity investor in the 
pulp, paper and steel net works fund.  They are in their final stages of due 
diligence and are comparing pulp and paper facts with gas.  (They are under a 
confidentiality agreement).  
Please call with any questions
Thank you,

1. # of years of NYMEX visibility on the typical gas curve.

3 years

2. # of daily trades on NYMEX, in total and for Enron specifically.

102,492 daily trades on NYMEX (11/28/00)and ours amounts to 8,061 per day 
(usually around 10% daily NYMEX trades)

3. length and nature of "price discovery" windows past the NYMEX portion of
the gas curve (e.g., 7 years of visibility provided by proprietary market
making past NYMEX, then 10 years of macro / industry average assumptions).

NYMEX price discovery equates to about 3 years. Liquidity of the market and 
proprietary market information equates to about 2 years after that with the 
remaining portion coming from more macro industry information.

4. trade volume data (# of daily trades as well) for each 5 year increment of
the gas curve beyond the NYMEX portion, in total and for Enron specifically.

we maybe slow, but we eventually get there,,

as you know Carr has been trying to get approval from within and from Enron
finance people to create margin financing to execute & clear Nymex (and
e-nymex too) business for Enron. Well we are finally there..
We would love the opportunity to renew our realtionship of executing and/or
clearing for you again.
We are told (by Sarah) that you would have to talk to your individual
finance person to get the particulars of this, but she told us that we are
basically approved.. If you have any question about this , please call..
Other than that any assistance we could be to help in this , let us know..
 definitely looking forward to this opportunity to do business again.

Mr. Nowlan:

When we spoke several days ago, I had mentioned the meeting between Jeff 
Shankman and Larry Kellner, CFO, at Continental Airlines.  The meeting had 
been scheduled for December 11th, 2-3 PM in EB 3321.  I will know tomorrow if 
this date is confirmed.  Following our phone conversation, I did follow up 
with the persons you suggested -- Larry Gagliardi, Douglas Friedman and Mark 
Tawney -- as I completed an overview of our initiatives with Continental.

The meeting on December 11th will enable Enron and Continental to continue 
discussions on three initiatives listed in order of economic value:  (1) fuel 
management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR 
analysis.  

In order to verify attendees at this meeting, Jennifer Burns suggested that I 
follow up with you.  Please note the Continental attendees listed below.  Did 
you want to have the same origination team at the meeting or others?  I look 
forward to your response so I can coordinate with them and confirm their 
attendance.  Continental had requested that we keep the Enron attendance to 3 
or 4 persons; they will do the same.

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)


We appreciate your suggestions.
Thank-you.

Contact Andy Rowe at 713 966 2107.   
They are a medium term fundamental energy player.  They have never indicated 
any interest in anything besides nymex or hub gas daily, but that may 
change.  They have interest in trading on EOL but have not gotten approval 
yet.

John- can you give me the name of your business line contact there, job 
function and phone number?  Also, whatever you know about their trading 
style- are they macro, program, technical?  Would they be interested in the 
same service we give Tudor, i.e do they want a salesperson to bring them 
ideas from our various trading groups??  Do they want to trade on-line or are 
they already??

Based on what you come back with, I'll give a call over there and see how I 
can resurrect the ISDA negotiations and get them trading...

Talk to you Monday,
CA

David and Bob,

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS 
relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities 
(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.  
After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin 
as the point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from 
Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith 
McAuliffe or Kent Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending 
additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business 
opportunities and issues.  

EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop 
the streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th 
meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product 
and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media 
solutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the 
intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these 
solutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the 
appropriate next steps to further our relationship.  

The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework 
for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until 
those changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq 
was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 
7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice 
amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 
on or before December 31,2000.   
2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, 
Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   
The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written 
notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a 
new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  
EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if 
Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we 
look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.  

Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create 
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Subject: PIRA Annual Seminar Preview

Hey JA:
I was at PIRA today and got a preview of their presenation on Oct 11-12 for  
their client seminars.
(Greg Shuttlesworth)
Summary:
They have turned a little bearish becuase
They believe that distillates will cap gas ( get some to graph HO, CL, NY 
No.6 1% and TZ6 Index  and NX3) the picture is very convincing
Supply is increasing at a faster pace (1Bcf/d more in Q4 and expect 
incremental 2 BCF/d next summer)
Canadian production is increasing
Deep water GOm is increasing
Lastly, Shallow water GOM is also improving after years of decline

Demand
modest in 01/02
more efficient gas turbine
economic moderation

Near term
Yes it looks a little ugly this winter
Possibility of shocks in the shoulder ( low storage and early summer heat in 
Apr-May 01)

Call me or write if you call for more details. I am also faxing you their 
fuel substitution slide---- it looks at up to 5 BCF/d being put back into the 
supply chain.


Thanks
JF

Dave:
I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.   If El Paso, absent this 
power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their WACC 
in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ENE, is that transaction a 
mark-to-market gain for us?  If not, what's the difference in paying them 
with an asset rather than cash.  If it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a 
way to generate false P&L?
John

Looks good except for settlement period.  Industry standard and for ease to 
Enron, a spread trade is treated as two separate trades.  Therefore, there 
will be two settlement periods for the respective legs of the transaction.  
The file below states settlement period is 5 days after both legs have been 
set.  Please change to 2 settlement periods, 5 days after each respective leg 
has been set.

Thanks to you and Jennifer for arranging.   I will be in attendance at 3:00 
pm and have asked either Jim Crowder or Everett Plante to also attend.   I do 
not know their availability yet due to the Enron PRC meeting conflicts.   Is 
it possible for me to attend starting at 1:00 pm - I have not been through a

thanks again for your help.

December 11th.

Thanks for confirming back with Jennifer Medcalf your availability, from 3-4

FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan 
A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as 
futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic 
funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC 
trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him 
to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. 
He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last 
time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll 
keep chasing it.  Per

amazing how with cash futures at $1 and the back such a piece that f/g under 
such pressure.  month 2 has been the strongest part of the board all year.   
will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt.  could j actually 
be strong?  seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in 
f/g.  a little worried about having the z/f effect again.  that is, all spec 
length trying to roll and funds trying to roll  at the same time leading to 
some ridiculous level at expiry.  any thoughts?

Please resend the forms needed although I may have sent the necessary docs 
with the courier that delivered the check.  Do not believe we've seen the

Will not be looking to put more money to work on the long only side for a

John -

Yes, we received your check and forms.  The check has been deposited and the
forms have been processed.  The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions
will begin on April 24th.

As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to
you in February, but I don't believe we got it back.  Also, I'm concerned
about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds
available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.

I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review
concerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.  I'm thinking we could
knock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge
funds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESS
manager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PM
tonight or tomorrow night.  With regards to the marginable equity for naked
options question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?

Thanks,
Mike

Due to VAR reasons, you and I  both need to sell today.  Vol and price are 
going up, implying Enron can carry fewer contracts today than Friday.  Have

Dear George,

I hope all is going well for you there.  I need your help.  Listed below is
an email from my contact person at Enron Media Services.  They are planning
to offer media in a trading environment (like a commodity) and need to know
who the "right" contact at SPE would be.  As you can see, they have met with
several people but are unsure who makes the media decisions at SPE.  Can you
please help me direct them to the right person?  If they have already met
with the right person, can you identify them so that I can follow up and
determine SPE's interest in their proposal.  Thanks for the help.

Sean,
The following are the contacts that have been made by Enron Media Services
with Enron Picture. The initial meeting, Enron Media Services was
represented by Mike Horning, Edward Ondarza and Steve Crumley.
We met with the following personnel from SPE:

- Allan Dick, VP Corporate Procurement
- Cherie Crane, SVP Media
- Joseph Foley, SVP Marketing
- Kathleen Shane, VP Finance
- Jennie Angelos, Director Business Planning
- Peter LaBrida, Manager Corporate Procurement

Mike has provided Allan with today's one-year fixed price swap for spot TV
media in NY, LA and Houston.  Mike expects feedback from Allan today on the
pricing and the Sony attendees from meeting.  The next meeting that Mike is
having is
11/1 with Allan Dick.

Could you do some investigation and find out what the feel is for the Enron
Media Services product offering and possible communicate to Sony Pictures
that there are revenue opportunities for Sony also.

Please give me a call when you have an opportunity.

Jennifer

but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning 
of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up a 
lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a 
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand will 
there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if you can 
answer that.

on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their feet 
and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes as
current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is no-not
unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q.
 remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started only 
6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full swing.
we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the
summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring a
greenhouse in the ohio valley
    good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon
and ill
keep you posted.

Hello all,

Several of you have inquired who would be attending the May 17 Guggenheim 
event on our behalf, whether Enron employees or guests.  While this list is 
always in motion, this should give you a good idea. 

I'm glad that each of you will be attending and hope that both you and your 
guests enjoy.  Please call me on my cell phone at 713-515-9208 if you need 
anything.  Otherwise, I will see you on the 17th at the Guggenheim.

Take care, Margaret Allen

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that, 
unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between 
numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an 
unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the 
decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until 
the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going 
forward.  Thanks for the feedback.

Andy:
Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.
John

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Best regards 


Andy

John:

Enron has a couple of suites reserved strictly for Enron use.  Each one holds 
21 people and the cost would be $2550 without food.  If we needed another 
suite then, Enron Field would charge us $100 per person as long as one of 
their suites is available.

it's one of those theoretically great trades, but those don't always work.  
Still, I'll put it on and win 7 times out of 10.  just so hard for the market 
to rally the backwardation is so weak. can easily see h going under if no 
weather appears.

Mr. Dyson:

Jennifer Medcalf asked me to forward to you the following brief overview of 
Enron's relationship with Continental.  Please feel free to contact Tracy 
Ramsey directly at #(713)-646-8311 with any further questions regarding 
Enron's buy side relationship  with Continental.   Ramsey is the Global 
Strategic Sourcing, Portfolio Leader, who manages the Continental 
relationship.

Enron Buy Side with Continental:

Current Enron US spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately $40 
million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.  

Enron Sell Side with Continental:

Additionally, Enron has a strong relationship with Continental's Fuel 
Management company.  Specifically, Enron has been hedging Continental's crude 
oil over the past 2+ years.  Value to Enron has been over $9 million; value 
to Continental has been over $45 million since 1999.  Enron Global Markets is 
currently exploring several other business propositions with Continental 
Airlines in the following areas of financial risk management:  weather 
derivatives, plastics hedging, and on-line jet swaps.  Enron Energy Services 
is exploring an energy (electric commodity) deal with Continental as well.

Mr. Dyson, please don't hesitate to call if I can be of further assistance 
regarding these sell side opportunities.

Mike:
Two questions regarding fees:
1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type 
investment into the hedge funds?
2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity.  
However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that 
Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?

Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber 
is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my 
above-market returns compromised by high fees.
Thanks,
John

Just FYI, whether it matters or not, but commissions in gas average $3-4 a 
contract.  Not sure about power.

While we are putting this card together I thougth you guys might like to see 
some of the imputed commission numbers.......I thought we would cut it off at 
$100,000 saved. I'm using an average rate of $10 per 10,000 mmbtu gas and 
power equivalent.

I would like for you to come talk to a couple more people on the gas floor 
about a possible position down the road.  My assistant Ina Rangle is going to

your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our customer 
biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell blood among 
the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see 
straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now 
i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this 
level though.

John,

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased from 
you (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle).  Unfortunately, our customer would like 
to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily 
is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) 
- so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your 
offer.

Regards,
Gary

I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average 
of prices, 5 per week.

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

Hi John !

My mistake again early morning...  I clicked on Gas Daily Henry Hub (EOL

Could you change it to NYMEX ?

Thank you and sorry again,

Jean:
I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The 
area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, 
long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need 
to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf 
group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas 
trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and 
the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further....
thanks for the article.

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the 
question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of 
correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are 
three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic 
volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to 
have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and 
elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when 
we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a 
different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants 
to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the 
range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a 
vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a 
function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at 
$4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all 
calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative 
skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off 
in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 
day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.  
second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution 
predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares 
by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected 
distribution.  
third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are 
bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance 
premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view 
towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly 
fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more 
expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak 
call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer 
fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the 
fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.  
if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this 
helps,
john

John, Mike

I work for the London Research team and am looking at 
some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.
Dave Redmond the options trader told me that you had done 
some fundamental research regarding 
the gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help.

I would be grateful if you tell me 
what you have done or suggest 
someone else that I could ask.

a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to 
switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing 
plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the 
gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at 
$1....need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test 
of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management 
keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too 
many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy 
prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.  

funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 
friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each 
front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.  

what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas 
switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market 
too oversupplied to care?

system will allow me to make a choice market by lowering my offer, sometimes 
it won't.  The system will never allow me to raise a bid to make a choice

The sytem should continue to disallow inverted markets, a market where the 
bid is greater than the offer.

the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just 
not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of 
demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we 
gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground 
and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, 
distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.
good holidays,

Subject:  Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy



Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be "substantial."  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"
Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Mosey
said.

The $5,000,000 extra VAR disappears in about a week.  There MUST be a 
band-aid to the term VAR curve before this expires.  Again, the back of the 
board is realizing 35-60% vol and it's being credited with 15% vol.

We will have a good percentage of the west position rolling off over the next

Hey Buster,

Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
desperately!  

I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!

Thanks honey! Margaret

I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how 
you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so 
dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could 
produce that effect.  
The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into 
the winter.

Subject: Stress Test

The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested.  Under the 
$7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price 
curves proportionally shifted.  Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the 
price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX 
volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.


Key findings include:
$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%  
$9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% 

       

It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the 
financial desk actually decreased.  This would seem to imply that up to the 
seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces 
risk).  But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that 
the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and 
increasing VaR by 74%.  Does this make sense or is something else happening?

Frank

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

Subject: Executive Reports Viewer: NEW LOCATION  




As of midnight, Saturday, October 7th, the Executive Reports Viewer will no 
longer be accessible at its current location, due to IT modifications.  The 
system has been redesigned to allow access via Internet Explorer (you cannot 
use Netscape).  The new location is http://ersys.corp.enron.com. 
This change will ONLY affect the viewing of the reports; it will NOT impact 
the publishing of the reports.

A shortcut icon can be created by dragging the Internet Explorer Logo 
(located in the address field next to the URL) to the desktop.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call Kristin Walsh at 
3-9510 or myself at 3-9307.

Thank you for your understanding,

John,

Sorry again...  my last 2 trades (EOL # 1112587 & 1112596 - I sell 1/2 day 
twice
@5.55 on May) were done again by mistake on US Gas Daily instead of NYMEX.

I have called your help desk to try to remove US Gas Daily from my NYMEX 
screen
which we cannot do so far unless I select each quote individually.  However 
this
would run the additional problem of not showing up new tenors you may 
introduce
over time.

Thank you and best regards,

Herve

Brian,

I apologize if I didn't make myself clear over the phone.  There is a process 
that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with 
existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it 
is for a small subset of the population.  Furthermore, all applications must 
be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the 
desktops.  As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to 
install the application itself.

Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?  It is installed 
with IE5 and provides real time chat.

I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at 
this time.

Regards,

-jkc

John,

I talked to Fangming, and unfortunately, her program is not compatible with 
IE 5.0.  Let's proceed with the installation of IE 5.5.  This is an extremely 
important program that all of the traders will be using.  If you need 
additional resources, I can arrange for this.  Just let me know what you 
need.  

These are the people we need to set up with the upgraded version.

Thanks,
Brian

Hey John,

We'd briefly spoken on the phone last week, but I haven't been able to come 
by and talk to you like I'd promised.  Louise had mentioned you did not like 
Cynthia Kase's newsletter and may not want us to put Cynthia's weekly 
summaries on EnronOnline.

Since Fred (Lagrasta) and his group think publishing her summaries on 
EnronOnline will attract more of the smaller customers, would you have any 
objection over us publishing the Kase newsletters.

Pls. let me know ASAP so we can proceed with this further.

Regds.,
Rahil

I'm not sure if you have heard our fun news yet, but Rob and I are moving to
Boston at the first of the year!!

I will be working remotely for HBK while looking for something new up there.
Rob is continuing his career with Fidelity, though in a much more convenient
location.  The only downside is he will actually have to go into the office
every day!

We would love to see everybody before we leave, though it may not be
possible with the holidays.  I'll be back in Dallas once a week in January
and February, so we could plan to get together during one of those trips.
But before that time, Rob and I will be with a group of friends from HBK at
Martini Ranch on Thursday, December 14th right after work.  I'm sure we'll
be there late, given my love of martinis, so please stop by if you can.

Regardless, I really want to stay in touch with my Texas friends, so make
sure and send me your updated contact information if anything has changed in
the last year.  Please pass this on to people who I may have inadvertently
missed or I did not have their current email address.

Cheers,
Heather Robertson



P.S.
By the way, our house is on the market right now, so if you know of anyone
looking, please tell them about it.  The address is 6815 Vivian Avenue,
Dallas, 75223 and can be seen on www.ebby.com.

Jennifer and Peter, welcome back...!

Attached are the notes from the EBS team and BMC organization regarding the 
proposals to EBS and Net Works (etc.) from BMC.

I am curious, Peter (or Glenn), if it is reasonable of BMC to make the 
statement to the effect that, "...the 45% discount is applied only if
we have the EBS Enron Partnership agreement in place...".  Is that cutting it 
close on the restraint of trade issue?

Bob McAuliffe has informed me in a note that if his people (Matson & Cumming) 
choose the BMC product at testing conclusion, he would support their 
decision.  Smith and Ogg have given "no go" indications.  I have received 
that information from Bruce Smith in a telephone conversation, but Jim Ogg's 
lack of communication with me is what I have used to draw a similar 
conclusion for his situation...

BMC and EBS both, I believe, are wanting GSS to do the contract work for this 
deal.  It is my understanding, Peter, that the timing of that request might 
be a problem for your guys...Perhaps we should have a quick, informal pow-wow 
about this?

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff,

Attached are all the outstanding deal proposals from BMC.  Lets push for some 
addl discounts so we can get each of these guys a "win".  I have asked our 
BMC contacts to reduce these quotes already due to our partnership but I am

We need your help Jeff, we cant do it without you.

Hi Steve,

It was nice talking to you.  Included here are the Product quotes that we
sent to the groups.  The Incontrol has multiple spreadsheets for Bruce
Smith's projects.  Real Media is for Everett.  The other two are self
explanatory.

The concern that we have is that there is still not a quote for Jim Ogg and
therefore it is not a quantified amount for the deal we're doing together.
That is significant because it effects discounts, volume, and certainly the
more BMC product that Enron targets the better for this deal.

As mentioned in the phone call, I'll send you a soft copy of the Enron Corp
(which includes EBS) software license agreement with BMC if I can get it for
you.  Otherwise it will be a hard copy when you come over today.  It
includes the terms of liability, warranty, etc.

I look forward to seeing you today.

Best regards,
Ann

		 Subject: The EBS Enron agreement

Hi Jeff,

I hope you are doing well.  There have been some interesting developments on
the way to the Enron Broadband/BMC agreement since we last spoke.
Apparently, it is extremely important to Jim Crowder to get this agreement
in place by December 15.  As a result of the conversation between Jim
Crowder and Jeff Hawn, BMC Exec., I have been directed to help Steve Morse
and Chaz Vaughan in leveraging the best deal possible for the various
projects that Enron is considering with BMC.  As you are aware, we have
already proposed several individual deals.  In addition to those we are
including some deals in which there has been an expressed interest so that
Enron can take advantage of the pricing that this partnership will bring to
you.

The purpose of this e-mail is to give you a heads up on the acceleration of
timing that we have been directed to work towards and to let you know that
we have already agreed to bring our price down in order to make the price
more attractive to Enron.  We would very much appreciate your help in
expediting the process of bringing this agreement to closure.  In my next
e-mail I will send you a list of all the outstanding BMC proposals to Enron.

I think you're cheating trying to get a fixed amount.... I'll give $1 per

Good luck,

John-

My name is Clayton Vernon, and I am the Manager for Models and Forecasts for 
East Power Trading, reporting to Lloyd Will.

I'm helping Research (and Toim Barkley) with a data visualization tool for 
EOL trades, and I wanted for you to know I'd like to make this product 
helpful for you.

In doing so, I'd like to also let my colleagues Chris Gaskill/Hunter Shively 
avail themsevles of this tool. But, I need to find out if the desks are your 
colleagues or, as things shape up, your competitors, since some trades are 
between Enron desks.

Can Chris/Hunter see synopses of all of our EOL gas trades, after the fact?

Clayton Vernon

Hello Mr. Arnold,

I hope that things have calmed down in the gas market with the cold weather
finally developing.  I have been selected to come to Houston for final round
interviews.  Do you know if visitors can come to the trading floor to see
what the operations are like?  Also, if you have any hints on approaching
the final round of interviews, I would appreciate them.

Thank you for your help during the application process, and I hope you have
a good week.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer

Hey:
So I was thinking about your NY problem...I might have an answer.  The site 
http://www.bestfares.com/internet_charts/hotel_internet.htm
lists cheap hotel specials.  The problem is they won't list them until the 
Wednesday before the weekend.  Check it out though.  They have some 
reasonable deals.

fyi - our position is either pay the $2.5 million termination fee or pay the 
$4.1 million toward Compaq future purchases.  You will see a bcc of my EMail 
to Bob and Rob.  My reason for the blind copy is that I want to ensure that 
this communication is between Bob and our group.

Everett and Jim,

I have phone calls into both of you to gain your feedback and support on 
appropriate next steps with Compaq.   Everett, I am asking for your input as 
it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the 
relationship owners.  During the meeting yesterday - the following happened :
 a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately 
(his replacement has yet to be named).  My perception is that Keith took the 
hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales 
projections.   EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected 
targets.  
 b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his 
existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server 
Agreement 
 c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS 
Services.   For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed 
at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 
8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters.  EBS sent 
Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th.   Compaq has not paid the 
invoice.  Lou Casari's team is handling the delinquency and notifying 
Compaq.  Compaq ( Keith M.'s stewardship) had agreed to pay.  Bob stated that 
EBS has not performed to Compaq's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and 
Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS 
services (Bob's first negotiation position).   
 d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in 
the EBS Server Spend amount.    
  Compaq (Bob Jordan) value  - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and 
hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)    - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million 
for servers and hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in 
1999
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional 
services (costs for Server deployment)

 From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the 
following might occur
  EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000  at 8% would equal a Compaq 
purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)
  Compaq total is $5.1 million spend  at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase 
amount of $408,000
  EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount 
is $4,134,229. (I did not concede) 

 e) 2000 income.   Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had 
to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could 
defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, 
2002.  If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the 
right to spend against the amount.  To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS 
worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS 
consulting services provided to Compaq.   Again, under Keith M's stewardship 
- they verbally agreed to pay. 

Now with the above information - my offered next steps :
 a) Until everything is done - maintain the "stick" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 
million).  This is being done.
 b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee.   It 
does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages.  Prior 
conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee 
(again with Keith M).   This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. 
 c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on 
services of $4.1 million.   This is a good return for a commodity 
transaction.  So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier 
relationship.   

 So...... please let me know your thougths.   We have countered with the $2.5 
million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000.  

Please let me know your thoughts

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Thad,

Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us 
which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual 
meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to 
choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the 
western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in 
NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th 
of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  

However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I 
need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' 
availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The 
meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for 
the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of 
meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible 
alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:

1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential 
solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and
2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to 
determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the 
(common) markets served:  "sell with" (each other); and "sell through" 
(channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as 
sales channels for each other's sales forces.

These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would 
include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss 
areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value 
propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a 
go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of 
some of the 
"EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item 
#1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be 
addressed.

Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for 
your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to 
Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days 
synchronized with your executives'.  

Thank you,

Jeff

Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about 
how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we 
post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server 
automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we 
immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as 
it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on 
ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market 
gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was 
that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which 
system you like better.

Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will 
be implemented shortly.

I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing 
a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance 
of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 
2-ways and killing the broker markets.

Subject: Re: FW: LNG Weekly Update

Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

Hey,
Can you add Whalley and/or Andy Zipper to Pedrone's interview schedule.  He 
can come in earlier if necessary. 

If you need to talk to him, he is staying at the Omni and his cell number is

See attached.   In September 2000, Requisite filed for a $92 M IPO.  
Requisite hosts content for some customers in Denver, but the majority of its 
revenues are from licenses and contracts with SAP.  Based on negative net 
income for the past few years, I am sure that credit would take a big margin 
for these guys.  I was not able to find anything that mentioned who 
Requisite's network provider is.  

Please let me know if you would like more info.

Matt,
I have spoken with Mark who is part of the GSS organization and we are going 
to pursue this after the first of the year.  Mark has a relationship with the 
President of Requisite and we will be having a meeting with him to discuss 
opportunity.

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Thanks.

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

Following are the working transactions in the Central Region/Gas that include 
utility/producer outsourcing:

3rd Quarter

Peoples Energy Production Company
PEPC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples Energy/Chicago.   Transaction 
consists of back-office, risk management and production management for their 
Production company.  Currently performing due diligence and will be making 
proposal (in conjunction with Jean Mrha's group).  Total volume of 30,000 
MMbtu/d oil/gas equivalent for 3 years.   50% probability for closure.

4th Quarter

MGU-Michigan Gas Utilities
MGU is wholly owned subsidiary of Utilicorp.  Transaction is a complete 
outsourcing for the utility (28 BCF/year) for a term of 3 years beginning 
October 2001.  MGU will choose a singular counter-party to proceed to 
structure/negotiations in the next few weeks.  We have received very positive 
feedback from MGU and place our success rate at > 50%.  Original transaction 
priced as Michigan Index trade, but effort was to determine their choice 
counterparty.  Initial indications are that the final structure will consist 
of a basket of index Daily/FOM and fixed price.  Russell Murrell and I have 
been working closely with the decision makers at MGU to ensure success.

SEMCO (Project Pluto)
Utility based in Port Huron, Michigan with sales load of approximately 37 
BCF/year.  Portfolio currently outsourced to TransCanada (4/1/1999-3/31/2002) 
and has been extremely beneficial to SEMCO.  TransCanada (See Gas Daily 
4/30/01) currently holds all fixed priced risk for load following and 
management at around $3.60 and SEMCO was the only Michigan utility who 
effectively managed the arrangements the Michigan utilities negotiated with 
their commission.  Bids are due in August and a counterparty will be chosen 
3rd/4th quarter 2001 for a 3 year transaction commencing 4/1/2002.   Visited 
their office with Sylvia Pollan on 4/11 and our risk is removing the 
incumbent, TransCanada.   SEMCO will be proposing a fixed price structure to 
Michigan commission.

On MGU and SEMCO, the Michigan commission will play a significant role in 
dictating final structures.  If Enron is not successful, these utilities will 
be managed by other 3rd parties and we will keep you abreast of structure 
outcomes.

Thanx,
Laura

very funny today...during the free fall, couldn't price jv and xh low enough 
on eol, just kept getting cracked.  when we stabilized, customers came in to 
buy and couldnt price it high enough.  winter versus apr went from +23 cents 
when we were at the bottom to +27 when april rallied at the end even though 
it should have tightened theoretically.  however, april is being supported 
just off the strip.  getting word a lot of utilities are going in front of 
the puc trying to get approval for hedging programs this year.

Chaz and Steve,

Here's the latest, in a nutshell.  Basically, the testing is not fully 
completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is 
also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the 
purchase decision).  As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out 
on vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas.  
However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to 
surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation.

In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with 
the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at 
EBS.  The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema 
Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, 
especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation.  

Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential 
vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC 
purchase at this point.  I will be on vacation next week, but will be 
checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th.  Jennifer or I will keep 
you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor.

I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug's most recent communication to 
me.  The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net 
Works teams in question:  more testing, but looks like BMC's total sales 
opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your 
deal done.  The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from 
yesterday still apply.

Thank you,

Jeff

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - we feel that a competitor's 
solution is a better one for us.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be an excellent 
product, and would consider it to be a viable option for purchase.  I believe 
Net Works will still evaluate more similar tools, and related design tools, 
before making a decision.

Regards,
Douglas

John & Mike,

Could you please fill out the attach spreadsheet COB today?  There is one 
swap term and one collar term.

It looks like we are getting close to a finance deal and are working with 
John Thompson in the finance group.  The outline quotes would be a buy out of 
existing deals on Enron's books.


Thanks,

I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of 
the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot 
of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I 
found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no 
minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the 
lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.

Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on 
what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And 
when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the 
information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the 
big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest 
individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.

Hello...
Despite my thoughts, you like baseball.   So the question is do you like art  
(as in musuems)  ?
I'm leaning towards yes but don't know for sure.

Jennifer,
Due to the Vivendi merger, the Universal deal has taken on a whole new 
scope.  On a lead from Jeff Y., I contacted Kim Monk, Dr. Corp. Alliances, 
who reports to Nebergall.  Kim was interested in discussing this further and 
working on best leveraging BU strategies.  We are to catch up when she 
returns to Houston, but this is what we discussed in our quick phone call 
today:

Vivendi 
Enron delivered an MOU to Vivendi (Kim may forward)
Currently 5-6 initiatives including:
Vivendi overall - bandwidth, co-location, dark fiber, PAN European network, 
cable 
Havas (Viviendi subsidiary) - discussions with Havas CEO for distance 
learning, bandwidth, ASP and streaming initiatives
Initiatives in other subsidiaries including:  Canal Plus, Digitel

Blockbuster
Due to restructuring of Vivendi/Universal, EBS to work on Blockbuster's 
year-end (Phase I) initiatives first and then (Phase II & III) 3Q next year
Cox speaking with Universal in LA as content and distribution partner 
(although this is Blockbuster's obligation, Enron is also working as a third 
party to secure)

Enron-Vivendi Relationship
Vivendi sees Enron as both a competitor and partner depending upon the segment

Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the 
deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on 
the deal.  
Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical 
deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.

Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal

The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for 
roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured 
deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the 
next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken 
care of. 

In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and 
CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against 
the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from 
December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from 
roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 
17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the 
producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with 
more details. 

There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to 
clarify. 

First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like 
payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both 
the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the 
December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment 
would take place on February 15, 2000. 

Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. 
Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and 
Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we 
would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron 
Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. 
(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've 
done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). 

 There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with 
the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with 
EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. 
However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this 
transaction.

CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split 
it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting 
with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. 
Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end 
of this week. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Regards,
Russ

The attached report contains an analysis of fuel switching capability. It 
also details one  of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data  
contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no 
longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost  and quality of 
generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets 
around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were 
significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and 
deregulation at the state level.

Jennifer asked me to explain about the effect of the refinery fire.

The St. Croix refinery has their reformer offline.  The reformer is used to 
convert straight-run naphtha into a high octane blending component called 
reformate as well as some butane and lighter gases.  The effect would not 
really be a reduction in gasoline, but a reduction in a high quality blending 
component which would make it harder to make RFG.

As of this writing, the fire is out. If you have any further questions, feel 
free to contact me.

Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus 
opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the 
winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection 
season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those 
projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to 
price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the 
equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand 
(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies 
will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as 
to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a 
comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number 
indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  
Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be 
a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting 
noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand 
equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.  
If we get two low injections, watch out.

Subject: Market Opinion about AGA's


	

John,
I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.  In the 
beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull 
case.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under 
stored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change 
that expectation. 

However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of 
bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.

At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come 
from the physical market and weather. 

I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.

Thanks,
Frank

Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a 
good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get 
her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers 
tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but 
she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Last Friday, Scott Macrorie, an electricity trader for the Mid-Atlantic=20

About 500 university students in the U.S. graduate each year with bachelor'=

ENRON PROVIDES TRADING SERVICES TO MANX ELECTRICITY UNDER NETA
2001-03-08 08:43 (New York)


     (The following is a reformatted version of a press release issued
by Enron and received via electronic mail. The release was not confirmed
by the sender.)

ENRON AND MANX ELECTRICITY ANNOUNCE POWER TRADING AGREEMENT

     London, March 8 -- Enron announced today that it has concluded a
long-term power trading agreement with the Manx Electricity Authority
(MEA), representing one of the first deals with an embedded generator
specifically designed for the New Electricity Trading Arrangements
(NETA). Under the agreement Enron will provide 24-hour trading services
to MEA under NETA in an innovative deal structured to maximise the value
of the electricity interconnector between the Isle of Man and UK
mainland.
     The =01A45 million interconnector runs between Bispham in Lancashire
and Douglas on the Isle of Man and is capable of carrying 40MW in each
direction. At 105km it is the longest AC interconnector cable in the
world.
     "The development costs of the interconnector to the UK placed us
under pressure to put the link to the highest and best economic use and
we feel our relationship with Enron has accomplished this" said Mike
Proffitt, Chief Executive of MEA.
     "Our commitment to reducing the price of electricity on the Isle of
Man is firmly embedded in MEA's five year plan and our trading
partnership with Enron will greatly assist us in achieving this goal."
     Richard Lewis, Managing Director of UK gas and power at Enron,
commented: "This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well
into Enron's trading portfolio. MEA will benefit from Enron's expertise
as one of the UK's leading energy traders and will provide us with their
skills as operators of their generation plant and the interconnector. It
is significant in that we believe it is one of the first embedded
generation transactions specially tailored for the new trading
arrangements."

Energy Trading Companies Pay Big for Weather Talent, WSJ Says
2001-03-08 06:47 (New York)


     Kansas City, March 8 (Bloomberg) -- The growth of energy
trading floors in the past several years has made meteorology a
glamour profession, even for forecasters who never even intended
to predict the weather on television, the Wall Street Journal
reported.
     Weather affects commodities trading and determines
electricity and natural gas supply and demand. That's why large
energy trading companies like Enron Corp., Williams Cos. and
UtiliCorp United Inc. recruit top weather-forecasting talent, the
paper said. Meteorologists with graduate degrees can command
$60,000 to $90,000 a year, far higher than the $33,000 the
National Weather Service pays a junior staffer.
     Energy traders use in-house weather forecasts to make quick
bets on the direction of electricity and natural gas prices. Fast
and accurate predictions can earn huge profits, the paper said.
     Many meteorologists say they like the pace and action of the
trading floor. While some in the profession work in broadcasting,
most meteorologists labor in the less visible and action-oriented
worlds of academia or government research, the paper said.

Subject: Meeting to discuss 2001 direct expense plan

Hi John,

Since Jeff has left I am assuming that you will be responsible for the plan 
for your cost center - 105894.  Please correct me if I am wrong.

I have scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 4pm with you to discuss the 2001 
direct expense plan for Financial Gas trading.  I will have a schedule that 
details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and 
a template for the 2001 plan.  

I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you 
tomorrow:

1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?  If so, what level of person?
2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?
3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?
4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want 
to plan for?
5) Are you expecting any promotions?
6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement 
agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?
7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?
8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should 
plan for?  If so, how much and where?
9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, 
monitors and software?
10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should 
plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)

My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished 
before Paula Harris took over.  She will be coming to the meeting with me.  
Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the 
meeting.

Thanks!
Suzanne

David:
Do you have a simulation set up that will allow me to simulate trades by 
pushing a buy or sell button and will move the two way so i can try 
simulating actual market cicumstances?

John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally "False"


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

         INPUTS           OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  >220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  <30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  <10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  <4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  >3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  >20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). 
Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.




Dave

What design are you talking about?  Do I have pink elephants on all my emails 
or something?

I'm very enthused that I have the skillset to be an advertising critic when I 
grow up.  It's something I've always wanted to do.


PS.  I'm a little sarcastic as well.

John, John, John....very impressive analysis!  The first two commercials were 
supposed to be idealistic spots announcing Enron as an innovative company, 
while the next four are proof points to our innovation by showing the 
businesses we have created. 

I know you were elated to get an email from me this morning, thus proving 
that I had not been kidnapped and all those important things I work on would 
continue to be completed.  Oh and that certainly is a pretty design you add 
to your emails.  Very masculine!  

Smile, Margaret

ps, i hope you can read my sarcasm over email -- if you knew me better, you 
would understand it completely since it is rare that i'm in a totally serious 
mood. hope you don't take offense!

I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, 
bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level 
than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.  
Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different 
than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I 
think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very 
impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.  

Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car 
thief.

So, what did you think?!  Don't lie or stretch the truth either -- you won't 
hurt my feelings, I promise.  

By the way, by the time I arrived home it was completely dark so I went for a 
three mile run this morning.  Not fun, but I'm definitely awake right now!  
BUT, it's all your fault I couldn't go last night....he!he!

Trade well, MSA

Honestly and for your (Enron) eyes only - attached is the modified

we like their Change Management tools but not really interested in Patrol

We will have a more definitive answer by Thursday.  We DBA's (eCommerce,

I agree.  Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about 
this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward.  I'd 
definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall 
commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply 
in the very near future.  I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with 
HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless 
decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, 
and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably 
linked.  Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more 
recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg 
understand that his focus was different than ours.  

Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process.  I have 
certainly found her involvement invaluable.

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

John,
Is there a man by the name of Henry (Dutch) Quigley who will be working in 
your group?  His name was not on the list I sent to you previously,
but he showed up on another list from HR as being assigned to your group.  
Please let me know and I will make any necessary adjustments
to your cost center for him.

Thank you,

Dave:
A couple things about the limit orders:

1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open 
should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.  
Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.  
Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading 
session unless specified otherwise.  

2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.  
When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 
increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the 
quantity to be 15,000.  

3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.

4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.

Thx,
John

Sarah-Joy...
I just picked up your voice mail...

I am forwarding Byron Gaddis's e-mail in response to your question of who
PCC is working with at EES.

Let me stress that I am not working with anyone other than John (and now
hopefully you) at Enron to get PCC Ball Valves approved for international
use at Enron.

I am providing Byron Gaddis' e-mail address as he is in Portland at Corp HQ=
,
and is familiar with the issue. He may be able to provide a name for you at
EES that PCC is working to conclude an agreement on energy....note that the
activity is covered under a Conf Agreement to protect PCC and its data. In
addition, Byron was curious about your possible need for blades and the
mechanism you go through to acquire them.

As for me... we would like you to fall in love with our world class ball
valves from PCC Ball Valves (hence putting them on the approved supplier
list) AND also love our Emergency Shutdown Systems for pipelines by our
Barber Industries (again, feeling so smitten that they find their way onto
your approved list)... John has the information packages on both companies
and product lines...

For me... signing off from Milan Italy...where I have been living and
breathing these ball valves this week. Shipments of 40" and 48" units going
to Transgaz on a Romanian/ Russian pipeline as well as 36" units for a
Turkish pipeline are going out....

The only person I have been working on in Enron about Ball Valves is John

For Enron to come to PCC Ball Valves outside Milan Italy for a quality audi=

I have heard that  our=01;Byron Gaddis was trying to reach you=01; about an=

ideas you might  have for large structural parts (remember out titanium

In any case... we  definitely want to make sure PCC Ball Valves is your

How are we doing to  get that distinction?

Subject: Long Term Volatility

John, Mike,

As you may know I recently moved from the Calgary office to the London 
office. The vol curve here is marked very similarly to the Nymex curve at the 
front but drops off to a much lower level at the back. Richard Lewis, who is 
in charge of UK Gas and Power trading, would like to discuss the rationale 
behind the longer end of the NG curves, both vol and price.

Could we all get on the phone sometime next week (Monday is a holiday here) 
perhaps before the open or shortly after the close? (The Nymex closes at 8pm 
UK time.)

Thanks,

Dave

Jennifer,
I had forgotten to invite Roy, but I did tell him about the meeting, and he 
was OK w/getting the notes after the fact.  I also told him I would not 
forget to keep him in the loop and invited to any future meetings.

As for Ron Smith, I really have egg on my face.  I totally forgot about Ron 
(I was thinking only Instromet, and S-J was running with that).  I think that 
in my excitement and effort to get this meeting put together, I overlooked a 
few important details.  I will certainly do a better job next time!

Thanks for the reminder!

JY
p.s. I was unable to get w/George during the day yesterday, but I did catch 
him at about 6:35pm.  I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities 
(Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).  He gave me some good feedback, 
and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.  The only thing 
I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on 
feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do 
the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW 
felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I 
can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this 
case.  But next time, there won't be a next time - so that won't be an issue 
anyway!

The meeting minutes look great and that it was a very beneficial meeting for 
all parties.  Was Roy or Ron invited?  If not let's make sure that they are 
at the next meeting so we do not get any static from them.

Russ:

A couple of questions
1- Check the DOE Northeast Heating season  report.   There seem to be a lot 
of LNG terminal and facilities in the Northeast. How do they work? What are 
the logistics of transportation etc...


2- Arnold's buddy has been looking into the logistics of  trucking LNG to CA. 
Is this possible? Can investigate the probability?



Thanks

a couple of observations from here:
cash/futures getting whacked.  whereas last weekend cash traded $1 over G, 
this weekend will probably trade $.15 over.  the lack of weather giving the 
market time to regroup.  good thing because another week of cold and the 
system was going to break.   certainly still has that chance in feb.  saw 
utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting 
any extra demand through spot market.  in effect, they said we're not 
withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage.  they had to encourage 
marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even 
normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again.  
this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in 
mkt.  g/h getting whacked in sympathy.  
probably priced 25 term deals through broker market  and own originators in 
past two days.  24 were from the buy side.  it's as if pira came in and told 
everyone term was cheap.  however, they've got the opposite view.  customers 
just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now.  don't see any let up in 
back support for a while.  
front spreads the hardest call right now.  g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what 
to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody 
else.  almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping 
for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in 
cash.  probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less 
downside.  

doing well here.  actually having the best month ever 11 days in.  played 
front short against term length.  got out of front shorts today.   probably 
early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected.  
will keep term length meanwhile.   i've hated summer backwardation forever.  
agree about u/h.  a little less crazy about  the trade now because i think 
the easy money was made over the past two days.  unbelievable spec demand for 
next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and 
crushed on move down.  jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front 
virtually unchanged.

don't know what to think of this summer longer term.  certainly not as easy 
as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas.  
now $6 for this summer, i don't know.  we're gonna have to inject the hell 
out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.  but we will feel 
production increase hit the market.  just buy vol.

I want to pass on my sincere appreciation for the excellent work and 
assistance from Colleen Koenig during last weeks crisis management program in 
Venezuela.  Colleen was more than helpful and provided services that I found 
invaluable.  She was extremely well liked by the senior management of Vengas 
and spent a great deal of time with them in creating an environment conducive 
to teamwork and productivity.  Her language skills, knowledge and personality 
provided an incredible resource.  Thanks for allowing my program her services 
and I look forward to working with her again in the future.

I would like to invite you to a meeting with Jeff Shankman on Tuesday
January 16, 3:30 p.m.  at Jeff Shankman's office.

We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20

special project, proposed by
a corporation. The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the 
impact of
electronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will  
result in a report that
will be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation. I hope that  you will 
find this report useful.

 We have invited our tiger team to visit Enron. The students will arrive on 
Thursday, 
January 18, and will spend Friday at Enron. I would appreciate if you could 
find 30 minutes
on Friday to talk to the students.

The meeting with Jeff on Tuesday  should not last longer than 10-15 minutes.

Vince

i think you're absolutely right about q/u.  again just a question of when to 
put it on.  Seems as if I'm always on the offer of that spread.  yesterday i 
had a 4.5 offer all day and i think i got 50 or so.  i can almost leg it 
better by buying winter and selling summer and the j/q spread. i would like 
to see it widen another penny before stepping in and i think with the 
weakness in the winter and relative weakness of cal 2, on any rally that 
could happen.

was that you on the q/u/v fly yesterday?

Did the Palestinians settle with the Israelis? No.  Did Dan Reeves settle
with John Elway? No.  Did Anna Nicole Smith settle with her in-laws? No.

But Salomon Smith Barney and Enron have settled all the issues and have
agreed to the $50 million credit facility.  The documents are in Mary Cook's
capable hands and should be completed next week.

In addition, I hope that Jon Davis' cooling demand presentation on Wednesday
(3:15) will be valuable for your trading endeavors.  John Galperin (on our
desk) will introduce Jon.  Try to stay awake during John's introduction.

Eric, 

Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with Tom Moore and me.  
Attached is the (only) contract which I have received from the EBS 
origination team trying to close a deal with BMC Software.  Steve Morse and 
Chaz Vaughan report to Brad Nebergall (VP, Central Origination, EBS), who 
reports to Jim Crowder (VP, Enterprise Services, EBS).  

Please review, and provide your feedback to me, the EBS origination team 
(Chaz, Steve, and Brad Nebergall), and Tom Moore.  

If there are any other EBS deals/contracts on the table involving BMC, I 
would like to do whatever I could to help them close on this.  Please let me 
know if I can do anything else for you!  You can reach me at (x55968) or Tom 
at (x55552).  The origination team is at (Chaz: x58815, Steve: x37137, Brad: 
x34714).  On a final note, the originators have repeatedly driven home the 
point that they must have this deal closed with BMC by end-of-day this 
Friday, December 15.  I am focused on helping them win the business however I 
can.

Thank you,

To "Outstanding" Analysts and Associates:
I  am writing to inform of a possible opening on the natural gas derivatives 
trading desk.  It is an opportunity to work on one of the most profitable and 
demanding groups within Enron, as well as one of the largest financial 
commodity trading desks worldwide.  I envision the role as performing 
analysis initially, to grasp an understanding of gas fundamentals and become 
more familiar with the trading environment, and leading to a junior trading 
role.  Upside potential is limitless for the right person.

Candidates for the role need to possess the following qualities:
1. Have been ranked as outstanding on previous yearend reviews.
2. Excellent math and quantitative skills.  Candidates should have 700+ math 
SAT and/or 700+ GMAT
3. Basic understanding of economics including pricing differences under 
monopolistic and competitive market scenarios.
4. Ability to work under intense pressure.  

If you are interested please email with interest and attach a resume.  Do not 
call.

John Arnold
Vice President of Gas Derivatives Trading

theres only one thing i can think of...   storage field turning around gives 
cash market completely different feel.   instead of utilities looking to sell 
gas everday, they look to buy it.  huge difference in feel of mrket.  not so 
much actual gas but completely different economics of how marginal mmbtu gets 
priced.  tightening cash market causes cash players to buy futures... hence 
the tendency for a spring rally every year.  read heffner today...even he 
talks about it

agreewith all, im mega bear summer 2nd q but for the time being weather and
as u
said uncertainy likely to lend itself so little downside until either
weather
gets warm or injections get big. i dont see the flow as you know but i talk
to a
cupla utitlities and the bias same as you menioned. ive neutralized bear
book a
bit cuz i cant afford to fite this thing. with deep pockets tho-i scale up
sell
next 2-3 weeks take a bet on 200 ish injections in april and 400 in may-ie
records
  aug/oct-yes-low risk-wasnt substantially more inverted when we were 4
bucks
higher-low risk but not a great reward. oct/nov-yea-wont make much for
another
few months on that so it range trades but ill cont to bersd it cuz if end
summer
that strong im always always more bullish the front of winter.
  other thing i wonder is how wide these summer contangos cud get-as
everyone so
bullish futs for the next few weeks at least.
   weather here sucks to day-tree almost fell on me driving into work-close
one,sahud be about 2 ft of white stuff when its said and done. dunno how
long i
can stay but doesnt look all that great for me getting out to steamboat
manana!!

heres a hypothetical.... we agree that demand loss y on y somwhere from 4.5
to
5.0 today, do you guys think that we can see a substantial demand recovery
if
prices dont retreat? my ffeeling is no for at least another 90 days or
more.thots?
   any thots on flat px today-im slitely long vs bearsds?

Subject: American Express

Hi Tracy,

On Wednesday of this week we had a visit from Jennifer and Peter, and we 
highlighted a number of problem areas that we are experiencing with Amex 
Travel Management.  They suggested we inform you of the problems, in the hope 
that you would be able to take it to a higher level on our behalf.

Up until a year ago American Express were based on the Wilton Site.  They 
migrated to Newcastle (about 50 miles away)  and  migrated again some six 
months later to Edinburgh ( about 120 miles away).  Each time they have moved 
the level of service we have received has deteriorated.

Some six weeks ago we had a meeting with Lisa McKenzie (Area Manager) from 
the Edinburgh office, at which we detailed our concerns to her.  She said 
that she valued our business and promised to take these concerns away and to 
rectify all problems.  In reality nothing improved, to the extent that we had 
another meeting with George Blues (Account manager)  last week, and informed 
him that we had not seen any changes for the better.  We also told him that 
if things did not improve within the next six weeks, we would consider taking 
our business elsewhere.  We have actually made contact with a local company 
and are using them in conjunction with Amex for the next six weeks.

Typical problems are:-

Communications - trying to contact people in Edinburgh is difficult.  
Response when we do contact them is not forthcoming.  Not being able to speak 
to the same person twice.  Promises of return calls do not materialise.

Invoices - difficulty in resolving disputes.

Car Hire - not negotiating the best deal with regards to rates.  We 
negotiated better rates with Avis ourselves.

Hotel Bookings - not using Enrons preferential rates on hotels with reserved 
rooms.

Rail Travel - lack of detail on tickets.

We feel that they are paying lip service to what we are saying and making 
general excuses in the non performance of their obligations.

We hope you can assist us in getting a better level of service than that 
which we are currently receiving.  

Regards

Lesley

Thanks, Chaz, for the response.  What I am looking for in question #3 
(purchase commitment) is did I convey the info correctly re:  what BMC will 
accept from Enron to allow the EBS deal to close?  From notes to the Net 
Works directors and Bob McAuliffe, I have copied the following statements 
into the space below:  

"1)  The pricing is applicable if EBS gets their deal done, and you are 
willing to provide some form of commitment (at least in writing, either 
e-mail or letterhead) to purchasing a BMC product in 2001...  For example, if 
Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their current 
testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail (or 
other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 (the 
preference would be to get the "buy" done by end of 1st Qtr, if possible).  
This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with their 
purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC."  Is this correct the 
way I have presented it to NetWorks?  Will their replies work for you if 
completed as requested above?
 
I didn't want to put you in a bind when I told the NetWorks teams what BMC 
would feel is acceptable proof-of-commitment, nor did I want to have to go 
back to the Net Works group and change the requirements.

I've got another note to send you in a minute or so, from Doug Cummins.

Thank you,
Jeff

Jeff,

Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal.  We are making real progress.  
Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  
$4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services
2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  
No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 
3.  Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving 
purchase commitment from Enron?  
Not sure what you mean here
4.  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be 
done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?
We prefer the 14th, but if we can't get it until the 15th, that will work


Please let me know if you have any other questions.  I will call you tomorrow 
to touch base.

Steve/Chaz - 

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point.  

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc.  In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the 
"accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Your 
note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

I will call you to follow up on this note.

Thank you,

Jeff Youngflesh

Hey Liz,
Thanks for letting me use the phone.  A real life-saver.

My brother had a Nokia world phone on the trip and it seemed to work 
better.   It got reception some places where mine did not and is more 
user-friendly.

On a different topic...Greg talked me into upgrading to first class for a 
flight in December to Australia.  He talked me into it by agreeing to pay for 
half.   Cliff found it funny and agreed to pay for the other half.  I haven't 
expensed it yet so I'm having Barbara send it on.    
Thanks,
John

John -

I left a message about this last week, but wanted to follow-up with
additional information for your review.  We have three offerings currently
available (or coming soon) that I feel would compliment the small/mid cap
and fixed income exposure you already have through Redwood, Sequoia, and
Willow.

Quantitative Allocation, LLC: Integrates four quantitative investment models
to drive aggressive (and potentially leveraged) asset allocation decisions.
Generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and
futures transactions.  Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to
-175% of net assets.  This is clearly different from the largely
non-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own.  I would consider this to
be a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund with
a brain and on steroids - call me and I'll explain that comment in more
detail).

Juniper Crossover Fund, LLC: Managed by OrbiMed Advisors, and focused on
global biotech and pharma.  Up to 30% participation in private equity.  This
could be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-class
manager.

Tamarack International Fund, LLC: Long/short stock-picker fund focused on
the international mid-cap market.  I feel this fund is very similar in style
to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the
international markets that you currently lack.  This is a new fund and the
first closing will probably be in June.

Of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not
constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests in
these funds.  Please call me if you're interested in any of the strategies
outlined above, and I'll have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to
you.

Hi John !

My mistake again early morning...  I clicked on Gas Daily Henry Hub (EOL
#1107435,    I buy 5,000 MMBtu/day  May @ 5.51)  instead of NYMEX.

Could you change it to NYMEX ?

Thank you and sorry again,

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

John,

The guy from Nymex can not come until next week, Thursday  2/8/01 at 4:00.   
It will last at a minimum of three hours and a maximum of 4 hours (which is 
unlikely).
 There is nothing on your calendar for that day.  Will this day and time work 
for you?  Let me know and then I will send an email out to the desk to make 
arrangements to attend the meeting that day.

-Ina

Frank:
One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold 
front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In 
such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how 
Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures 
were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, 
and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position 
currently.  But in the winter that may change.
Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the 
assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter 
the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long 
cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.   
While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the 
payout probabilities may look like the following:

20%  $ -.05
40%     $ -.02
20% $ 0
19% $ .03
1% $ 1

Subject: Stress Testing

RAC is working on developing some "canned" stress tests regarding VaR.  For 
example, one test could be called "hurricane", were the prompt month is 
"stressed" on both price and vols, holding all other inputs constant. 

Anyway, I would like to know of any likely/realistic stress scenarios you can 
think of....

Let me know,
Frank

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

		 Subject: Computer Associates - Meeting Notes

Stephen Down and I met with Computer Associates in Toronto yesterday. Here 
are some of my thoughts on how it went.

We met with Julia in the morning -- went to CA's Toronto office, where we 
made presentation on EBS. Later Julia made a presentation on Computer 
Associates, their Sales manager talked about their "security suit of 
products", we were given a demonstration of their UniCenter TNG software, and 
then taken to lunch.  At lunch, we were joined by the President of Worldwide 
Online Corporation (a Canadian startup).

About Computer Associates:
Computer Associates is a highly centralized organization run by its founders. 
The company is the third largest independent software manufacturing business 
in the world. It offers more then 800 software products. Like other companies 
in their space, their stock has taken a beating this year losing more then 
half its value (Jan 00: ~ $70, now ~$27)

Julia Ruslys, is part of their "Strategic Alliances" team -- their mandate is 
to manage:
Strategic Business Alliances
Development Partner Program
eForce technology unit
Analyst relations

CA's APPROACH
Computer Associates sees EBS as a potential "development partner". Their 
interest seems to be in a long-term alliance with EBS, where they can package 
their software with a bundled network offering (from EBS) for their clients. 
They claim that their main product UniCenter TNG has a 30% market share of IT 
infrastructure management market. It is a cutting software package that can 
manage all LANs or remote networks for an Enterprise. With a stunning graphic 
interface, the software can be configured to manage:
All networks within an Enterprise
Each computer connected to a node within the enterprise can be monitored and 
managed remotely (software installation etc.)
Their is a plethora of add-ons to the basic UniCenter package including some 
advanced "Asset Management" tools that can predict future utilization through 
a neural network architecture.

She commented that with UniCenter TNG, our clients have "full control and 
flexibility over their whole network" EXCEPT  THEIR BANDWIDTH NEEDS.  EBS's 
flexible and intelligent BOS, if integrated with UniCenter TNG, can provide 
an enterprise complete control over their IT infrastructure with exceptional 
flexibility. Similarly they have a keen interesting in developing and 
expanding their storage solutions.

They seem to be interested in expanding their market opportunity and 
increasing revenues through increasing the number of "CA certifications" and 
joint selling initiatives. In other words, they would like EBS's network to 
be CA-certified by developing compatibility between UniCenter TNG and IPNet 
Connect. They currently have 1500 partners, including almost all top names in 
IT infrastructure space.

EBS APPROACH CONVEYED
Although I think we have conveyed EBS's approach of "looking at specific 
quick and clear opportunities", CA does not seem like a lean-mean 
organization. Furthermore, the people that we met with, did not seem to have 
an appreciation of the financial structuring and risk management capabilities 
-- instead seemed to be disconnected with the corporate financial goals of 
their organization. For example, when Steve Dowd talked about financial risk 
management tools, their sales manager started talking about how they help 
enterprises manage risk through their "security software packages."

WORLDWIDE ONLINE CORP.
Worldwide Online Corp. is a startup (with less then $2M revenues) that claims 
to have good connections with CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp.)  They were in 
contact with Brad Sims' group out of Portland. That group, at some point lost 
interest in Worldwide because Worldwide are looking for video streaming 
services. Being a start-up with no credit, it is understandable why they were 
abandoned by us. Steve made it clear that he knows nothing about the deal and 
he may give Brad a call. I personally do not see anything for us in the next 
two quarters or so even though the company has been promised many sports 
broadcast opportunities by CBC.

It is interesting that Worldwide Online is a small client of CA. Julia went 
out of her way to convince us to meet with Worldwide Online. At one point, I 
almost thought as if her main goal was to promote a dialogue between EBS and 
Worldwide online.

NEXT STEPS:
Steve and I made it clear that it will be important for us to look at some 
specific short to medium-term opportunity with CA. Julia is going to identify 
the people in her organization whom we can have constructive dialogue with 
regards to IP connectivity needs of CA (their network infrastructure 
procurement team.)  At the same time, we had to show an interest in bringing 
her team together with our product development people to see if any 
integration opportunities exist between UniCenter TNG and IPNet Connect 
BOS/Storage etc.

-Ali.

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

So my point shown a little bit right now..  Weather a little cooler for this 
week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got 
totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all 
the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the 
length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy 
inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short, 
just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to 
keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.   
With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going 
to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and 
hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.  
Leads to more upside potential in short term.  
My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell 
side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales 
have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was 
cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from 
california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points.   
i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that 
with little downside.  Thoughts?

After our meeting with Dell on 10/27, I sent a request to Charlie Ball (works 
for Kip) for detailed power data from TXU. Charlie delegated the task of 
getting this data to Randy Don Carlos, who has yet to return any of my calls 
to update the status of the request.

Charlie Ball left me a message this morning indicating that Randy Don Carlos 
was leaving Dell at the end of the month. He indicated that he will get the 
information to me as soon as he can. I'm not sure, but it seems that no one 
has sent the request to TXU yet. TXU generally will send out data within 1-2 
weeks of a request. It has now been 6 weeks since we asked Dell for the data. 
Assuming Charlie actually gets someone to send the data request to TXU, we 
should get something by the end of the year.

Similarly, Continental has not yet sent over data that they were to request 
from HL&P. I talked with someone in Mark's group on 12/4, and she indicated 
that they had the data, but their real estate group wanted to review it 
before they sent it to us. On this one also, it is unlikely that any 
transaction will get done in this calendar year.

Please call if you have any questions.

                -1000 December Nymex

 2.     -1000 July Nymex Straddles

 3.     +1000 July 2002 Nymex

 4.     +1000 July 2002 Nymex

 5.     +1000 July Socal Basis

 6.     +1000 July Chicago Basis
          -1000 July Michcon Basis

 7.     +1000 July Henry Hub Index

 8.     +1000 July 2003 Chicago Basis

Again, these are separate portfolios.  I'm trying to check that the VAR 
numbers make logical sense.

Savita:
A couple of issues:

1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis 
child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system?

2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they 
meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas 
dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually 
I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm 
restricted right now by issue #1.

Please advise,
John

Subject: Re: using new FF vols  

Hi, John,
following up the discussion with you on Friday we talked with Risk Control 
people who are not excited to use that FF vol curve
you sent to me. Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them 
for all the locations.
The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol 
curves from historical data.
I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price 
curves for NG and 
all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.
I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers 
based on these curves:

     5/30/00  5/31/00
AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000
AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761
AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685
AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225

You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. 
I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which 
would give more weight to recent data.
We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect 
backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.

Tanya.

On Friday I emailed a new vol curve to use for VAR testing.  I was under the 
impression that you could apply this vol curve to the price book and storage 
book and have a new experimental VAR number by Monday. I have not received 
any response.  Please reply with status of this project.

i think we would rally if march were the only thing traded.  Problem is 
summer and on out so weak.  trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to 
600.  some customer selling in cal 2.  so h/j and j/k need to blow out 
because no other spread is moving.  i'm a seller of j/k so h/j needs to 
blow.  all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly.  
it's a struggle each penny at this point.  at least one spread needs to break 
if we're going to run and i don't see that happening.

Jennifer, 

This is apparently the type of deal flip-flop which BMC has been blessing EBS 
with.  In the note from Doug Cummins which contained his updated spend 
projections, he had the "Professional Services" highlighted with a bunch of 
question marks.  It is at the bottom of his sheet, and lists a qty of 30 @ 
$2000 per = $60,000 --- I assume that's $2K/hour or per day.  Either way, 
it's not something that appears palatable to them (Net Works).  I'll be going 
over there in a few minutes, and will try to check w/each of the guys.  I'll 
keep you posted.

Jeff

Clarification on the below.

Point #1 our position has been $3MM on software (they are saying they need 
$4MM to get the deal done.)

Additionally, they want Maintenance and professional services to go with the 
dollar amount.  $2.4MM is their position here.  I need your help to clarify 
with each group who is on board with maintenance and profesional services.  
BMC's #2 guy Jeff Hawn told Jim Crowder this was critical for them.

Jeff,

Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal.  We are making real progress.  
Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  
$4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services
2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  
No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 
3.  Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving 
purchase commitment from Enron?  
Not sure what you mean here
4.  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be 
done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?
We prefer the 14th, but if we can't get it until the 15th, that will work


Please let me know if you have any other questions.  I will call you tomorrow 
to touch base.

		 Subject: BMC Update

Steve/Chaz - 

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point.  

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc.  In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the 
"accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Your 
note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

I will call you to follow up on this note.

Thank you,

Jeff Youngflesh

position summary does not sort by both product and counterparty, just by 
product.  It would be very useful if you can replace this. 
Thanks,
John

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

Hi All,

I think we should play hard ball with these guys.  They want a great deal 
more business, and we are going to have to see something in return for us to 
pull this trigger this year or early next year.  Lets have them help us find 
opportunity.  Also - Gary's idea of longer term is a good one.  Especially 
for a company of this size.

Re Rex, all BW deals go through EBS so we are accountable for the BW 
opportunity.

Couple things

1.  Dale/Patrick - can you guys please get involved here.  Gary has done a 
good job bringing in a live deal.  We need some focus to make it happen.
2.  Paula - can you please setup a conf call for Thurs, 11/30, morn.  Gary, 
Jennifer S, Dale, Tucker, and myself should be on the call.

Thanks!

MH

Spoke with Curtis today:

- he is still waiting for Dietmar to provide us the international cities etc 
so that we can size the opportunity
- reiterated what we learned on the call -- their is no storage opporunity 
since they self-serve
- told him we doubted that their network is at 60-70% utilization and there 
may be some intermediation opp yet to be discovered
- we talked extensively about EBS' concern that the size of this deal appears 
small, my comment was that we can create a larger deal by extending the terms 
to 10-years (or something greater than 2 years) with bi-annual renewals, this 
also ensures the two companies pro-actively work with each other
- Curits keeps asking me about deal size and I stated that if we don't get 
specific requirements from SAP we can not place a value on the deal so there 
is no use trying to pull a number out of thin air.
- Curtis asked about Rex and whether he gets comped for broadband - he is 
concerned about cutting Rex out since they were his first contact, I need 
help on this -- Anyone?

Bottom Line - ball is in their court to provide us details so we can take 
something to structuring and size the opportunity.

Subject: VaR

John,

We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues.
The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26
where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good
candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.

It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR 
system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative 
basis,
jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.
This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a 
big
jump in VaR.
This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look
at column D.

The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:

 a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the
                     code to review it.

 b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in
                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can 
propose, is to develop for
                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to 
review the fwd vol curve
                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  
it can be smoothed.

Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?


Vince

Come by Tuesday between 5:00-5:30 if you still want to see the new

I talked to Jay Surles and Kenny Policano at Adams Resources and concerning 
CATDADDY and POWERTRADE.  I informed Jay that it was in violation of their 
agreement to "sell, lease, retransmit, redistribute or provide directly or 
indirectly,any portion of the content of the Website to any third party."   
They indicated that they had provided the id to one of their marketers in New 
England.  They also suggested that they had a broker that watched spreads for 
a commission therefore theoretically the broker was an employee of the 
company.  After all the bull they agreed to have them shut down and they 
would refrain from doing it again.

Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product 
priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really 
shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the 
predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.  

One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new 
product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated 
basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated 
basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec 
Nymex.  Any ideas?

industrial demand the scary thing.  no question there are some steel mills 
and auto factories and plastics plants that were on last november that arent 
coming up now and its not due to gas prices.  the economy sucks and it will 
affect ind demand.

but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning
of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up
a lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand
will there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if
you can answer that.

off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day
swing y
on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their
feet and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes
as
current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is
no-not
unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q.
 remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started
only 6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full
swing.
we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the
summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring
a
greenhouse in the ohio valley
    good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon
and ill
keep you posted.

John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally "False"


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

         INPUTS           OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  >220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  <30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  <10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  <4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  >3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  >20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). 
Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Thanks.

John,
Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. 

First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock 
liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the 
plant, so that wouldn't help. 

Second, it seems there are more of these "portable pipeline" units floating 
around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas 
(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has 
one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. 
Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are 
about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic 
feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said 
yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the 
pipeline system in California. 

This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG 
consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that 
he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested 
in looking further into transporting LNG into California. 

Assuming that we could get a few "portable pipelines" and some trucks, there 
are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:

Location Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage 
(gal) Storage (mmcf)
Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2
LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2
Sacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8
LaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92      
Evanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2

Totals         26.48

Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The 
Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to 
providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with 
LNG fleet owners. 

I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting.

I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average

Subject: SMUD deal Asian options

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

I hope you know we were just kidding with you yesterday.  We don't get many

I think I am a couple of the "we are not" attributes in your book.  Is that

agree with contango story .   cash to futures pretty bullish but a picture 
where agressive inj now are bearish later.  so curve should flatten.  also 
back of curve (cal2,3) under a lot of pressure now.  customers will be buying 
all the way down and will get fucked just like last year.  contango has been 
under considerable pressure even with the front falling...any rally should 
result in those snapping in to 4.  good scalp in my opinion.
definitely seeing your side on the $5 level.  surprised we havent gotten more 
demand back as we sit at these lower levels.  
off to cabo today for a long weekend.  kind of exhausted at work right now so 
a much needed break.

i wud think apr shud also start to find support from contangos, storage 
players,
ie pretty attractive contangos given the bullsih mkt sentiment, and spec a
little short will eventually roll. i bullspd a little little at 5.5 just for a
scalp. if cash converges which it shud as we fall in px then shud see sprds 
find
support at the 5-6 ct level/month? ?
    other than that-im still bearish-5 bucks not sustainable longer term and
nothing yet telling me otherwise. economy and oil curve also not going to help
ngas. buying 4.00 summer puts
  thanks for comments on utilites-i'll bet they buy all the way down but i 
think
theyll have so much gas coming at em if we stay at these levels the mkt will
ultiamtely force em to back down.
  in ny yest and today-saw the red hot chili peppers last nite , was awsome,

By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you 
do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out 
today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that 
might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some 
serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign 
whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many 
things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, 
obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we 
thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should 
discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.

If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, 
we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august.

any questions please feel free to call.

As Final Exams Begin, Power Is a Big Question

c. 2001 New York Times Company

For final exams, prepared students pack extra pens, calculators, bottled 
water, granola bars. And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus 
this year, a flashlight. 
As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during 
California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 
31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts 
may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.
''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior 
communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. 
''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People 
have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' 
In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. 
Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the 
disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the 
options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a 
Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. 
Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms 
have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have 
sufficient natural light.'' 
The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of 
California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in 
a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in 
February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to 
the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy 
consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison. 
Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside 
campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the 
blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. 
At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress 
levels. 
''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because 
I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a 
sophomore majoring in political science. 
Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to 
grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, 
planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a 
problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. 
''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' 
Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member 
class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on 
the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to 
Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the 
final counts for only 20 percent of the grade. 
That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, 
is hoping for. 
''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my 
air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''

(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)

BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But 
others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company 
announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry 
BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This 
thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans 
as well as making future working capital more expensive. 
The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same 
BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that 
change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market 
prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures 
the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such 
costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, 
whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.
Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the 
whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no 
doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a 
result. 
In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages 
had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to 
cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has 
reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts 
have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. 
The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled 
is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears 
to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too 
much, so prices should fall further. 
The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth 
business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This 
sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the 
resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the 
greater advantage of shareholders.

OUTLOOK
Outlook
Houston needs to think small about future technology
WILLIAM DYLAN POWELL

(Copyright 2001)

OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook 
readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone 
mentions Houston? 
Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random 
acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While 
Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to 
start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology 
advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.
Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular 
scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power 
numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to 
construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered 
matter. 
Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, 
you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford 
residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The 
possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for 
their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories 
that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a 
patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. 
Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all 
manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the 
environment and from a business process standpoint. 
Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with 
fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a 
functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these 
have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS 
(nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. 
This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect 
Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's 
economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting 
research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, 
still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities 
of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic 
development. 
Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two 
separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; 
and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, 
nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent 
machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much 
technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet 
the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. 
Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister 
to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of 
semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye 
on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated 
$2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And 
a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of 
their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion 
dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its 
own projects, but they receive far less publicity. 
Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice 
University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic 
excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate 
and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting 
technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity 
and support than other less commercially significant disciplines. 
On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will 
converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends 
that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief 
executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue 
of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its 
potential economic impact on the region? 
I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of 
Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound 
benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. 
Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's 
going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while 
Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think 
small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to 
our city and its economic development.

A
Panel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of 
life top group's list of needed improvements

A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation 
as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to 
transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. 
The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated 
with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston 
must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to 
compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever 
they choose.
Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn 
enrich the lives of every Houstonian. 
"The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests 
of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management 
executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. 
A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force 
recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have 
discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 
years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public 
education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and 
current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of 
successors. 
The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role 
in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of 
business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined. 
"Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of 
the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major 
corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of 
Houston," the report states. 
"But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly 
diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter 
how benevolent those leaders might be." 
The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most 
successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned 
Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, 
president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president 
and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the 
Greater Houston Partnership. 
Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group 
is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. 
"They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool 
around with something that is ill-conceived," he said. 
Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who 
advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's 
work could be very influential. 
"This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the 
part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life, 
Klineberg said. 
The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a 
source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier 
business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan 
said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the 
center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. 
Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people 
representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, 
seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various 
guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston 
scenarios. 
James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined 
in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not 
necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, 
they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. 
In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and 
decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop 
participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to 
the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. 
Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air 
standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax 
rate increase. 
Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the 
gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a 
large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year 
hardship post on the way to something more desirable." 
Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system 
by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational 
resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn 
leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in 
the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. 
These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to 
state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school 
graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or 
technical training programs. 
The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they 
would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and 
federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent 
on more traditional educational programs. 
In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's 
reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that 
hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically 
competitive. 
These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable 
city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and 
redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and 
public transport in corridors that delight the eye." 
Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate 
pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range 
of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street 
light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail 
lines extending in various directions. 
To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome 
their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt 
"new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city 
centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the 
expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city." 
Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy." 
The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns 
its energy toward diversifying the economy. 
The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its 
business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology 
and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly 
become significant global players. 
The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements 
of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city 
in which to live and conduct business." 
Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees 
to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such 
as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to 
begin translating these ideas into policy, they said. 
Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce 
results as soon as possible. 
"If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a 
low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway 
said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the 
nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. 
"We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure 
that we educate these kids for our future."

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion

05/13/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.

Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided 
not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete 
construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. 
"It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into 
infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the 
board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the 
phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.
Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General 
Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. 
However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, 
the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the 
completion of the project. 
DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus 
marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. 
DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in 
last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been 
able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity. 
The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 
65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global 
debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC 
after its completion. 
In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity 
shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders.

Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED

05/13/2001
Agence France-Presse
(Copyright 2001)

DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a 
project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East 
Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday. 
Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the 
Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE 
Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between 
Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
"The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is 
being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told 
MEED. 
Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported 
last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for 
constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as 
too high. 
"There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to 
develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. "But whatever 
happens, we are staying." 
On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the 
project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic 
metres) of natural gas per day. 
Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the 
agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was 
inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. 
According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price 
formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following 
"high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi". 
TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar 
project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), 
with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. 
>From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to 
Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also 
planned, as part of a regional gas network.

SMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what 
amounts to limo service on the lake

KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden 
box he'd made at school. 
"This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago. "When I grow up, I'm 
going to live on a boat."
His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand 
until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure. 
On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter 
yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot 
luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay. 
"This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant 
boats. "The others are here to party, but this is it for me." 
The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against 
the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad 
executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party 
for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered 
among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white 
dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her 
neck. 
In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star 
Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment 
on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. 
Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million 
in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics 
to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked 
down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. 
One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. 
Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as 
regular on-board equipment. 
"It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore." 
Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the 
prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, 
transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The 
galley crew does the final cooking. 
Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its 
size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but 
Lober has hundreds of competitors locally. 
"I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, 
drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things 
you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on 
a boat." 
Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 
30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and 
VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a 
limo does on land. 
Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the 
Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters 
deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can 
seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. 
Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a 
supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in 
Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business 
after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M 
Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. 
But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat 
to providing exclusive entertainment on the water. 
In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of 
vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism 
or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, 
researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take 
to float his idea. 
Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 
passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the 
notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. 
"I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five 
feet deep in places, he said. 
Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. 
"This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober 
said. "They had no confidence. 
"I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank 
and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and 
tell me what it needs,' " he said. 
Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, 
he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a 
charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. 
After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel 
Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 
percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar 
engines on the boat. 
Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving 
drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. 
Clair. 
Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. 
The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but 
it didn't prepare him for marketing. 
"I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent 
$125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that 
he called "a total flop." 
Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as 
long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, 
he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a 
time. 
Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, 
insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave 
once," he said. 
Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he 
got one: target marketing. 
He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the 
boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate 
client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate 
customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy 
Mills mall. 
"We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi 
Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. 
"The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. 
Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back." 
Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star 
Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, 
the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of 
waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still 
undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober 
adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future. 
"We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the 
other boats," he said. 
After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting 
everything back into the business. 
The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate. 
But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers. 
"We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they 
prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said. 
It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector 
screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that 
some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other 
locations on the Houston Ship Channel. 
If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath 
the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor 
causes the player to bounce. 
Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from 
the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star 
Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements 
for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a 
major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's 
stanchions into palm trees. 
And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats 
instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being 
honored at a recent floating awards banquet. 
Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back. 
"They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first 
cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something 
different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they 
usually want to do it again." 
But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered 
boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards 
dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes. 
About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent 
corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company 
has chosen to have with Star Fleet. 
Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that 
Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are. 
"It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he 
said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just 
one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake, 
there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can 
actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor. 
So people have to be reminded." 
He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford 
cruises, Lober said. 
"Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare 
our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, 
country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And 
our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut 
corners." 
Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax 
and gratuities. 
Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his 
crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with 
some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras 
beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks. 
"We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the 
best and give it back to them." 
Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's 
business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make 
their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real 
opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three 
boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers 
moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 
guests. 
But one boat can still do a lot of advertising. 
At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were 
slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star 
Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they 
were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. 
As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge 
under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - 
the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star 
Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. 
It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from 
school years ago, Lober says. 
And he's going to live at the top.

More power to reform agenda
Soma Banerjee

THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the 
infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose 
of government support. 
Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private 
investments in this sector have failed to take off.
Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about 
Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its 
promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole 
consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy 
sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of 
this key industry. 
Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating 
new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health 
of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power 
plant developers. 
After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit 
only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in 
greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. 
The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection 
are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement 
that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution 
front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs. 
``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they 
are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say. 
But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms 
cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before 
they break even. 
The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if 
the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron 
too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry. 
IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop 
by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it 
difficult for investors to take decisions. 
``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up 
for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for 
eight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project 
is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source. 
According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance 
Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health 
of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs 
have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or 
escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. 
According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now 
responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the 
Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. 
But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield 
much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that 
can help this backbencher.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit Possible
By Himendra Kumar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

05/12/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s 
(ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute 
over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu 
said. 
In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact 
that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power 
price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.
A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with 
representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another 
meeting May 23. 
Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours. 
"I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first 
meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There 
has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the 
meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a 
meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes," 
Prabhu said. 
Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron 
Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly 
maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving 
issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open 
offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract." 
The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity 
from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 
billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. 
A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, 
recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour 
for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. 
The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial 
disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, 
failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is 
working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of 
excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of 
the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. 
The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a 
revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt 
naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron 
has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second 
phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant 
will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. 
Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest 
shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General 
Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.

India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue

Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 11. OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee 
headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power 
Company. 
Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last 
night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.
Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. 
Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development 
Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders, 
Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting. 
When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are 
coming again on May 23. What does that mean?" 
Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, 
senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the 
State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the 
rebate slapped on DPC. 
"Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by 
DPC to the centre-stage," the official said. "The company has not mentioned a 
single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or 
the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate 
in our letters to DPC," he said. 
Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the 
company would issue the preliminary termination notice. 
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and 
Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their 
stand vis-a-vis Enron. 
They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB 
does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. 
They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is 
learnt. 
MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it 
against the non-performance penalty. 
Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice 
issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that 
DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the 
Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default. 
The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three 
arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept 
the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - 
leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. 
The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to 
the conciliation notice from DPC. 
Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC, 
Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and 
Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC. 
Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and 
Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on 
May 23, Mr Lal said. 
Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and 
telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving 
Dabhol Power Company (DPC). 
The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr 
Harish Salve's candidature for the job. 
The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third 
conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the 
Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable 
conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. 
DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the 
substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three 
weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the 
conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force 
majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the 
project.

India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach

05/12/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.

Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a 
"willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power 
ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol. 
"I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC 
and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same", 
Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday.
He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra 
government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between 
MSEB and DPC. 
When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion 
that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should 
buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity 
and not buying one. 
"There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term 
power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying 
states", he reiterated. 
Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential 
buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same". 
Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the 
latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 
300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be 
commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.

LOCAL STORIES
DEFAZIO CALLS FOR STATE TO BUY PGE TO PROTECT RATES
DAVE HOGAN AND JEFF MAPES of the Oregonian Staff

05/12/2001
Portland Oregonian
SUNRISE
C01
(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)

Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's 
motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor 
"I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can 
insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business 
community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale 
markets." -- U.S. REP. PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.
The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General 
Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market, 
U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday. 
Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but 
others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing 
factors. 
Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to 
DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. 
Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio 
said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and 
generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon. 
"I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can 
insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business 
community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale 
markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore. 
PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and 
is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific 
Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible 
buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. 
While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders 
showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea. 
"I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this 
time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already 
has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and 
conservation. 
Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and 
talk with DeFazio. "I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't 
plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state 
government could run a utility as efficiently as a business. 
DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership 
would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway 
corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would 
provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be 
a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back 
into the state's coffers. 
The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. 
DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in 
the realm of possibility." 
DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob 
Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents 
customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE. 
Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the 
utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville 
Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to 
publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to 
buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity 
sales contracts that already are in place. 
And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't 
necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks 
said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned 
utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. 
The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE, 
but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it 
had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly 
owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention 
for DeFazio's potential candidacy. 
"I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose 
schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of 
those," Eachus said. 
DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area 
issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to 
build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with 
his plan.

Congressman suggests state buy PGE
By CHARLES E. BEGGS
Associated Press Writer

SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the 
state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. 
The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber, 
who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.
PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 
customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many 
Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets." 
DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and 
have the utility operate as a public power entity. 
He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission 
rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources. 
"While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be 
feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. 
Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. 
Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, 
citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political 
environment in the West. 
Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private 
utility, as long as it would benefit consumers. 
DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public 
ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville 
Power Administration's hydropower. 
The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature. 
"Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons. 
"Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a 
bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue." 
Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large 
businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating 
plants. 
Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the 
Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job 
like a utility purchase.

John - do you mind sharing your Fimat line with the crude traders?  Current 
usage is about $6 million.  Also Warren thought that he might be able to 
change the variation limit from about $10 million to $6 million.  This change 
would allow us to use the line for $14 million for original margin (they have 
a good rate.)  Warren is going to call you about it.  Sarah

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Team, 

Attached is the newest EBS orgchart, updated 2 days ago.  They have made some 
interesting changes.


Also, you can click on the URL below to go to the EBS intranet site, where 
you will find all sorts of information related to EBS, its market and 
competition, etc.  As a "high-tech" company, they actually do keep this 
updated very frequently, unlike some of the other Enron internal web sites.

(you will find Norm Levine's market/comp info here, as well)

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Jennifer, 

I hope James is getting the treatment he needs to get on the way back to 
normal!

As you can see below from the reply from Serge Minassian's AA, it would 
appear that the note I 
sent to Thad on the 21st hadn't been used to successfully transfer the info 
to Barbara...I will 
now call Kim Godfrey back (I was waiting on this response from Ms. Korp, so I 
could better know 
the Avaya Execs' calendars' status).

I'll talk w/you later...

Thanks for the message and especially for letting me know that the meeting

Barbara,

I do not know if you received a "heads-up" on this,
but since you are working with Executive calendars and the
Briefing Center resource, I wanted to make sure you had it.
Better safe than sorry, especially with the recent holidays.

Thad White and I agreed that in order to properly simplify
the communications channels between our organizations,
that he and I should be the primary points of interconnection
for this particular project and these meetings.  I apologize that
I do not have the calendar availability of the various Enron
Broadband Services executives, but given the opportunities
of having meetings in Basking Ridge either:  (for 1.5 days of a
3 day period) December 19 - 21, 2000 or January 9 - 11, 2001;
the (tentative) preference leanings are toward rescheduling
the currently proposed dates of December 13/14 to the
January 2001 dates.

I will keep Thad posted, and he will keep you posted.  I
apologize for any delays or confusion, if any, but I will
periodically check in with you as well, to make sure we're
all on the same path.  My primary communication focus will
be Thad, however, in order to minimize any confusion.

Thank you,

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't
have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being
possible alternates...

Thank you,

Barbara, et. al.:

After a flurry of phone calls, in which both Jennifer Stewart
and I have spoken with Serge Minassian, the following dates
look like the most likely targets:  for the 1st day (half-day session),
Wednesday, December 13.  For the 2nd day (full-day session),
Thursday, December 14th.

Serge has indicated his availability for a 2-hour block of time,
on the 13th in the afternoon.  That meeting would be essentially
an executive overview and strategy session for the appropriate
Avaya executives and the Enron Broadband Services exec-
utives.  The bulk of that meeting would be EBS' presentation
of their Value Proposition for the potential EBS/Avaya efforts.

The second day would be for members of Avaya's engineering
and development organizations, and possibly marketing; to
have a full day to meet with the equivalent EBS team.  Both
software/firmware and product platform-type of concepts would
be examined, and any other area in which EBS and Avaya
development folks felt that there were possible synergies for
a solution or solutions for the following 2 primary areas:

1)  "sell to":  EBS solutions to Avaya for internal use, and
2)  "sell through & sell with":  EBS and Avaya possibly
developing a solution for bringing to market in a similar
fashion to the Avaya/Siebel Systems' efforts.

By way of copying this to the EBS team, I am asking that
they will coordinate with me whom they would be sending,
and to make sure that the 13th/14th of December fit into
the appropriate calendars.  If there are any Avaya questions
related to development/engineering efforts, I would coordinate
as well, and most likely route to Larry Ciscon, or other EBS
engineering/development executive(s), as appropriate.

Thank you again for your help, and we look forward to the
opportunity!

Jeff & Thad,

I spoke with Serge this afternoon.  He definitely wants to meet with Enron
as soon as possible, but only for a maximum of two hours.  Two members of
his team will participate, Wayne Sam and Edward Chang.  I will coordinate a
date with them and send a message of available days and times.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to call or write.

A HUGE THANK YOU from me to you!  This is exactly what I was hoping for (even 
if the amount of purchase is not what some folks might have been wishing for, 
the reply is critically important)!  I really appreciate your having taken 
the time to help out by providing this information.  

I will check back with you on Thursday, if I haven't heard from you by then, 
to see about the "commitment letter"!

Thank you again,

p.s.  I will be forwarding your note to Randy Matson and Bob Martinez, to see 
if it would help them in their efforts.  I'll also copy you on that one.

Honestly and for your (Enron) eyes only - attached is the modified

We will have a more definitive answer by Thursday.  We DBA's (eCommerce,

We have a number of key initiatives in process with Continental including 
sales of broadband services, weather derivatives and facility management that 
have the potential to exceed the savings being offered by British Airways.  I 
would prefer that we stay the course with Continental plus I am confident 
that Continental can either meet or exceed BA's current offer.

George,

Enron Europe has negotiated a preferred supplier agreement with British 
Airways which will save us circa $3m a year vs Continental Airlines. I know 
there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me

Good Morning!

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be

an Enron counteroffer.   Any news on this?  

Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.


Appreciate it.

  What it's trading  what I think it's really worth 
apr oct   540    500 
nov mar 547    375
cal 2  491    400
cal 3   460    325

Obviously most bearish the further out you go.  However, the game right now 
is not sell and hold...although it will be soon.  The game is where will it 
be tomorrow and next week and next month.  The market is structurally short 
term gas thanks to our friends from california.  where ca is buying power, 
williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 450 or 475 or 500 
or 525.  irrelevant.  so term is not going down in the short term unless the 
front comes into the 400's and scares some producers to start hedging or we 
or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years.

Sarah:
Can you create a spreadsheet summarizing Enron's open futures interest broken 
down by commodity and broker, including maintenance and initial margin for 
all commodities (including rates, currencies, gas, crude, etc).  
Also, can you create a list of all margin financing agreements in place and 
the rates we pay.
Thanks,
John

australia definitely sounds cool.  might be a little tough though.   
i'd be in for keemah if you want to do that

I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in 
Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA 
certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in 
the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it 
may not be doable.  

Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few 
years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their 
own boat.

I will keep you posted -

Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time
Company Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation
El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share
HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG
<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today
announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in
our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said
William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy
Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.
Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.
Telecom Update
``We have made substantial progress in the development of our
telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.
Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,
we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant
Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''
Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.
With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews. Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

By Fiona O'Brien
   LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The head of the largest yet Internet
exchange for energy products said it will combine traditional anonymity
with transparency to give traders a better overview of market activity.
   The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based venture
initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August
24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go
live soon afterwards.
   While market transparency will increase as dealers used to
over-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, users
of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, Jeffrey
Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.
   "As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both
counterparties," he said. "The real strength is that you (still) get the
ability to manage your own counterparties.
   "You can list all of the people you want to do business with and put
in the credit terms under which you will do business."
   This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a
"giant matrix" within the system.
   "(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't sure
they have ever seen the entire market," he said.
   "(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals you
can't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market."
   Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently
aware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market
transparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who
fall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.
   The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock
and will be accessible via the public internet or a private network
connection.
   Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco
<BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale
<SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>.
   Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operation
and Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominant
internationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.
   Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and power
companies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy
<UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy
<REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>.
   Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that
the founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will
face additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to
trade a minimum volume.

   TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING
   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believes
trading over the Internet could boost trading profits.
"The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a
paperless back office can really save a lot of money," he said.
   However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off given
that dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing
systems, as they do in current OTC systems.
   Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties will
receive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those
players' own risk management systems.
   But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own
clearing system.
  "No one really knows how at the moment," Sprecher said. "There might
be some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists
peer to peer."
  In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurred
except those associated with trading. Membership is open to any
commercial market participant.
   Each product will have its own published commission schedule, which
Sprecher assessed at "slightly below the best prices someone would pay
in the voice broker business".  ((London newsroom +44 20 7542 7930)

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be "substantial."  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"
Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Mosey
said.

Jennifer & Shirley Jo

As per our earlier conversations, Jim Kirkpatrick (buyer) and I formulated 
the attached two (2) spreadsheets regarding OEC Central Purchasing's spending 
habits over the past two (2) years.  
I have only listed vendors/contractors where we have received in access of 
$5k per month and who I feel should be approached about a purchasing 
agreement that would benefit all Enron Divisions.
If you have any questions feel free to call.

Sincerely,
Jim Meyer

ps I know Roy Hartstein and Michael Frost in your group are interest in this 
also.

Mr. Shankman:

In preparation for the meeting on December 12th with Larry Kellner, CFO, 
Continental Airlines, I have noted below some background on the 
Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  Mr. 
Shankman, please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the 
attendees.    

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continental's crude oil.  
The relationship has been beneficial to both sides.  As a result, since 1999 
Enron has made over $9 million and Continental has saved over $45 million.  

The purpose for the December 12th meeting is to address three initiatives in 
order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and 
(3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.   Several new initiatives being 
proposed to Continental include the following:   

exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau, 
Originator)  
transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator)  
creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawney 
and Gary Taylor, Originators)
outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these 
products with Enron (Alan Engberg, Originator)

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Meeting Attendees from Enron:
Jeff Shankman, President and COO, Enron Global Markets
John Nowlan, Vice President, Enron Global Markets
Craig Breslau, Vice President, Enron North America
Mark Tawney, Director, Enron Global Markets (tentative) 

DISCUSSION: 
(Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg, Larry Gagliardi, Gary 
Taylor, Craig Breslau, Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz.)

Enron Buy Side with Continental:

Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was 
approximately $40 million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six 
months of 2000.  

Enron Sell Side with Continental:

(1) FUEL MANAGEMENT: 

Current Business:  Over the past 2 years, Craig Breslau and others have been 
managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford, VP, Continental Fuel 
Management, hedging Continental's crude oil.  The first transaction was on 
January 14, 1998 -- a one month Forward on Kero.  Since then, Enron has 
completed 29 transactions with two commodities:  KERO and Crude.  Current 
business consists of three crude call options, settling in December 2000 
($31.00) and January, 2001 ($34.00 and $35.00)

Value to Enron: Enron has earned $9,682,084 (1999-October 6, 2000)

Value to Continental:  Continental has saved $45,001,744 (1999-October 6, 
2000)

Possible next steps:    (a) A transaction where Enron exchanges call options 
on crude oil for airline tickets.

(b) Financial jet swaps on line:  Larry Gagliardi has already spoken with 
Rick Pressly, Director, Continental Fuel Management, regarding financial jet 
swaps on line.   At the time, Pressly was not interested in pursuing this 
product offering.  

Value to Continental for (b):  a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging 
with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge.  
Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multi-year options 
as well both with financial and physical jet fuel.

Possible next steps:  Would Larry Kellner be interested in (a) or (b)?  Enron 
could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following 
locations such as the US Gulf Coast, New York harbor, the US West Coast, and 
Europe.  (Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor).  
If so, Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Online 
identification number if Kellner's office wanted to review the product.

(2) WEATHER DERIVATIVE  PRODUCT:

Business proposition:  Create a basket of weather related risks - such that 
aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from 
Enron to Continental.

Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their 
annual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussing 
earnings.  It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge 
for all of Continental's weather related exposure.  However, it is not 
difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it.  
Continental has hubs in Houston, Newark, and Cleveland.  The weather 
conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include - 
rainfall above certain amounts, snowfall above certain amounts, temperatures 
below freezing (de-icing costs), winds above a certain speed, etc.  

Value to us:  Create value by designing a basket of these risks.  

Value to them:  Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continental's exposure.

Possible next steps:   Upper management would need to issue a directive to 
various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect 
the bottom line, how much they affect the bottom line, and then ask each 
group to attach a "confidence level" to each of their estimates - Continental 
could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted 
average of their exposure x their confidence level - or some portion thereof.

Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following:

Clear exposure.  Quantifiable.
Clear exposure.  Difficult to quantify
Potential exposure.  Quantifiable
Potential exposure.  Difficult to quantify

For each of the above categories, Enron would also need an indication of 
whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress 
historical weather data.

Enron's weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel, 
Director and Airport Services Division Controller, and some of his team (or 
others designated by Kellner) and brainstorm about different types of weather 
that cause increased cost to Continental.  (Gary Taylor made a brief 
presentation to Rummel on November 6th; no follow up action with Enron has 
taken place to date)  

(3)  PLASTICS:

Business proposition:    Alan Engberg proposed that Continental outsource 
their antifreeze risk (ethylene glycol / propylene glycol) and plastics (high 
impact polystyrene, polyethylene) by hedging those products with Enron.

Value to Continental: Cost/Budget certainty (assuming a perfect hedge whereby 
their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) and 
associated reduction in volatility of cash flows

Value to Enron:  The value is approximately $2 million notional value if they 
hedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure.  Since Continental 
has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, Engberg cannot comment 
on the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be much 
larger than $2 million.

Possible next steps
This proposition is being considered by Ron Howard's team at Continental.  
Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron.  Enron could 
then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of 
outsourcing their commodity risk to Enron.  Could a follow-up meeting with 
Ron Howard's team and Larry Kellner's designated contact be arranged to 
facilitate this process?

Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach 
to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful 
and rewarding to both companies.  David Port is already (x-39823)  looking at 
ways to outsource Enron's expertise in this area.  Continental could be a 
pioneer in the effort.  Factors to model would
include jet fuel, natural gas, electricity, currency, interest rates, 
plastics, antifreeze, paper, and, metal.

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate 
margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the 
front, they are also buying back summer.  el paso large buyer of next winter 
today taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong 
on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk 
premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, 
down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish 
to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments 
for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was 
trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of 
probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that 
has to be reflected in h/j.

I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and 
maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is 
$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing 
ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher 
clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope 
your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.  

Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El 
Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long 
futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin 
costs.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Karen,

Thank you for the update.  It looks like we'll plan on having the EBS/Avaya 
meetings on January 10th and 11th, 2001.  The first day will be a full day, 
the second will be 1/2 day, a.m. session.  You have asked me to provide a 
list of Enron attendees, titles, which day(s) they would likely attend, and 
some background information on the meeting(s) purposes.  An explanation of 
the meetings' proposed focus and probable attendees is in the attached 
meeting notes.  

The notes are from the November meeting which we coordinated and held for 
Enron Broadband Services and Dave Johnson.  By copy of this note to Kim 
Godfrey, we'll update the EBS executives on the meetings, and work on 
arranging their calendar availability.  So far, we have had the EBS execs' 
calendars penciled in for the time slot of January 9-11.  At this point, I 
would expect that the EBS attendee list would look something like this:  

Jim Crowder, VP, Enterprise Services; Enron Broadband Services - day 2 
Everett Plante, VP and CIO, Enron Broadband Services - day 2
Larry Ciscon, VP Software Architecture, EBS - day 1&2
  (selected team members of Larry's organization - individuals TBD by Larry) 
- day 1  
Steve Pearlman, VP, Strategic Development, EBS - day 2 and/or day 1
Kim Godfrey, Director, East Origination, EBS - day 1&2  
Jeff Youngflesh, Director, Business Development, Enron Global Strategic 
Sourcing - day 1&2  
    (others as suggested by Kim Godfrey or other EBS executive)

>From Avaya, the EBS team would like to meet with Dave Johnson, Serge 
Minassian, John Stephenson, and their selected Avaya team members.  

Per my conversation with you earlier today, the Enron Broadband Services 
meetings w/Avaya will need to be scheduled such that the overall agenda will 
"flip-flop" day 1 with day 2.  Originally, the first day was going to be a 
half-day executive strategizing meeting in the p.m. (allowing for travel to 
NJ), and the 2nd day to be more a product- or solutions-focused effort, with 
a full day's agenda.  Based on the fact that Dave Johnson will only be 
available the morning of the 11th, the meeting schedule will be reversed, 
such that the "full day/products/solutions" meetings will precede the 
half-day executive strategy sessions.  I have checked w/Barbara Korp, and 
Serge Minassian and John Stephenson are both available on the 11th, as well 
(John Stephenson would have a hard stop at 10:30).


Thank you,

Jeff Youngflesh

Dear Mr.. Lavorato,

The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our
account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to
have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds
are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.

Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.

2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the
beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new
instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.

REGARDS
MARIA.

Hello:
It is the Blue Men Group.  Two friends highly recommend it.  It's in the 
Astor Theatre on Lafayette in the Village.
43rd should be good.  I think you woul dhave had more flavor in Harlem though

I've been tasked with getting tickets to a show.  Was it 'Blue Men Group'
that you recommended we see?  And Michelle lives on W43rd, so it's not
as bad as you thought.

We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult 
process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be 
separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen 
this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year 
and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero 
or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there 
will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His 
contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will 
continue to be a subjective process.

A funny story:
Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of 
unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the 
exchange stopped trading for an hour.  
Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything 
was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange 
closing.  One yelled at Rappaport...
"Why don't you take your million dollar bonus and go buy Enron stock"

i read this as though 1.5 bcf/d of more switching takes place in the summer 
versus today.  is that because of the forward curves are backwardated for 2 
and contango for natty?

Subject: Incremental Fuel Switching For Distillate-- Summer Estimate

Given the shape of the curve, my guess for incremental substitution is 
1.5Bcf/d for No2 oil.  
So for the period  May-Sep01 an extra 1.5Bcf/d will be put back into the 
system due to No2 oil usage.

confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction?


From: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/07/2001 08:55 AM
To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc:  
Subject: rebuttal

I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months. 
Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand 
destruction. 
? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- 
Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are 
underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy 
is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is 
changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power 
demand as a result of  Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on 
what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying 
is  that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries 
will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure 
in service industries.
? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have 
imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly 
entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. 
Also they will  budget for these prices instead of $2.50
? See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos --- 
increases of 20%. When asked the implication for missed earnings and their 
plans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the 
bright lights business'
? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom
 First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much 
worse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates 
this week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar 
which will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will 
not tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction 
in big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this 
is not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming 
more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the 
whole story.
? Finally, I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here.

well there's my 2 cents.

be tomorrow and next week and next month.  The market is structurally short 
term gas thanks to our friends from california.  where ca is buying power, 
williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 450 or 475 or 500 
or 525.  irrelevant.  so term is not going down in the short term unless the 
front comes into the 400's and scares some producers to start hedging or we 
or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years.

so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not 
bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of 
recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a 
little far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have 
had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential 
industrial switching processing...    
as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was 
extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be 
running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 
5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from 
waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent 
reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where 
gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of 
more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build 
the stack now to estimate.  
frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will 
continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering 
right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 
100,000 last week as gas got to parity.  
let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from 
engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen 
demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.
bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really 
inactive.
to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj 
numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts 
to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short 
right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though
not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.  
however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to 
great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.  
notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?
in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 
cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.  
market needs to see some big stg numbers first.   
i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.  
Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last 
year's early weather, bombs away.

this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires
power px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient,
weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in
july-shud be marginal in apr-jun
   if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is
implied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys 
like
me turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be
less factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will
be closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think
we'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner
     now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx 
where
we are today
    all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider
extraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured
before-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie
liquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. some
ammonia/fert prod  has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d
industrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha
unction of an economic slowdown.
    anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your 
big
fund customers(ospraie). we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seems 
quieter
in the mkt lately.
  heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is
on a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then
means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and
be unable to inject all the gas available? thots
    also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct
discount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it 
bt
wondering if its transportation or storage cost related.
  have a good weekdn my man

i think you are done with hhd/cdd stuff -ie did you complete the cdds vs
utilites demand? also monthly hdds vs residential and commercial
demand?(combined)?, cdds vs total stock change??
 if all these are done add them to the summary sheet in usable formula 
form-ill
show you what i mean

then we start our price data base from bloom berg

check this out-using the regression you did for nov-march 99/00 came to a draw
of 155 with 195  gw hdds, i decreased the draw by the amount i beleive is the 
y
on y supply demand swing. ie 1.5 bcf prod
                                                  1.1  bcf./d import

                                                    .5 ngl neg processing
                                                   1.3 r/c conservation
                                               
---------------------------------

=7.4* 7=103 aga came in at 101, so excellant, back testing vs the week prior 
cam
to 81, vs aga 81!!!
nt bad-is a very bearish s&d is this continues cuz says injections will be
enoromous in the spring

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Jen and Paula are definitely going to NYC for the long weekend.  Think
about what you want to do, and I'll call you tonight to discuss:

Do you want to spend the long weekend with me or do your own thing?
If you want to spend it with me, would you rather go to the beach or
to NYC?

Michael:
Thanks for putting the paperwork together.  

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment 
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with 
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual 
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass 
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above 
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present opportunities 
such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong 
growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd listen.

John

We'll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options.  At some 
point, I'd like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- 
perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close?

Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look
into that for me.
John.

John -

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not
sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're
interested.

Hey Buster,

Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
desperately!  

I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!

Thanks honey! Margaret

>Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, a leading figure in Judaism's Reform
>movement as president of its seminary, has resigned from his job
>after being suspended by the movement's rabbinic organization for
>having entered into "personal relationships" in the past that the
>organization said violated its ethical code.
>
> Rabbi Zimmerman, president of Hebrew Union College-Jewish
>Institute of Learning, where he had been considered a charismatic
>and innovative leader, quit that post on Monday, after the Central
>Conference of American Rabbis suspended his rabbinical functions
>for at least two years, college and conference officials said.
>
> In a statement, the college said the suspension followed an
>investigation by the conference into "personal relationships" of
>Rabbi Zimmerman, which it did not specify other than to say that
>they predated his appointment as president in January 1996. Rabbi
>Zimmerman was the seventh president of the college, which was
>founded in 1875.
>
> Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff, the conference's executive vice president,
>said its board approved the penalty on Monday, based on a
>recommendation by its ethics committee, which looks into complaints
>about the conference's 1,700 members.
>
> Rabbi Menitoff said that conference rules prevented him from
>discussing the case but that the board decided Rabbi Zimmerman had
>violated a part of the ethics code, paragraph 2A, which deals with
>sexual conduct.
>
> It is included in the section of the code on "personal
>responsibility," which covers such matters as family life, personal
>honesty and finances. It calls on rabbis "to be scrupulous in
>avoiding even the appearance of sexual misconduct, whether by
>taking advantage of our position with those weaker than ourselves
>or dependent on us or succumbing to the temptations of willing
>adults."
>
> Hebrew Union, which trains men and women as rabbis and cantors and
>in other graduate and professional fields, has 1,500 students on
>campuses in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York and Jerusalem. Before
>becoming president, Rabbi Zimmerman, 58, was senior rabbi of Temple
>Emanu-El in Dallas from 1985 to 1995, and senior rabbi at Central
>Synagogue in New York, from 1972 to 1985. He is married and has
>four children. From 1993 to 1995, he was also the conference's
>president.
>
> Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was first reported yesterday in The
>Cincinnati Enquirer and The Dallas Morning News.
>
> Efforts to reach him through the college and its officials were
>unsuccessful. The college said it appointed its provost, Norman
>Cohen, as acting president and would search for a permanent
>replacement.
>
> Rabbi Menitoff said the conference followed "the same process that
>we'd follow with any rabbi in the conference in similar
>circumstances." He said complaints against a rabbi are referred to
>and investigated by the ethics committee. Depending on that
>committee's findings, the conference may dismiss the complaint,
>privately reprimand or publicly censure a rabbi or suspendn or
>expel a rabbi.
>
> Rabbi Menitoff said the decision to suspend Rabbi Zimmerman was
>"very difficult and painful for everyone involved."
>
> Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew
>Congregations, the Reform movement's synagogue organization, said
>Rabbi Zimmerman did not contest the findings or the judgment
>against him but responded to the decision "with great dignity."
>
> Rabbi Yoffie said that during his tenure as president, Rabbi
>Zimmerman added younger scholars to the faculty and expanded the
>college's Los Angeles branch so much that it will begin ordaining
>rabbis in 2002.
>
> Another member of the conference, Rabbi A. James Rudin, emeritus
>director of interreligious affairs at the American Jewish
>Committee, said Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was "a real loss" and
>"a shock to the movement."
>
> Hebrew Union's chairman, Burton Lehman, praised Rabbi Zimmerman as
>"a great, great leader." Mr. Lehman said that Rabbi Zimmerman's
>resignation would "have an impact" but that the college was strong.

i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late
morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point
on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily
trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes
equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k
cash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet
that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get
there k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will
be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last
year.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are
selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling
their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z
spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in there
right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primary
juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm a
seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it either way though.

you got me wrong-i wanna sell oct buy nov forward. look-two scenarios med
longer
term. we inject like mad early summer-economy stays crappy the frot of the
curve
gets slaughtered.-oct/nov goes to 3 cts sometime between now and end sep
   scenario 2-they dont enject what they want-oct /nov wil stay tite
between say
3-and 10 cts like this year but man after this winter they will panic at
some
point and buy the hell out of the winter strip and blow out oct /nov to 30
cts
cuz they panic. to me if that one was to ever backwardate it was this
summer-low
low stx and injections and they still blew out cuz they panicked about
winter-as
we see this winter now for good reason..?? capeche? i thinkit a win win

 you still in the damn mar/apr-i only sold a little prenumber-cant beleive
how
this got killed after-what changed?? from 1:30 to 2:05

We are still on for drinks on the 19th.  You have called the market very well 
since you started sending me updates.  Unfortunately for both of us, a couple 
of good calls does not a soothsayer make.  Thus, keep sending me your updates 
so I can at least get a little broader judgment of your abilities.   In terms 
of my trading style, I take positions to make $.25-$1, not $.05.  Too much 
noise in this market to trade differently for me.

I hope you know I was just fishing for a reaction on the phone before.  I
assumed we would discuss a potential relationship when I'm in Houston on the
19th.  We're still on for drinks after work, right?  By then, you should
have a comfort level with the quality of my work.  I think the analysis I've
given you has been quite accurate as to market turns and price behavior.  It
would be helpful if I had some idea of how you trade/view the market.  Are
you mainly day-trading or do you hold positions for several days/weeks?
That way I can structure my comments in order to best serve your interests.
Let me know.  Thanks,

John:

The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing. My
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural
appears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is  poor,
particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The  market
appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If  we
are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be
extremely  bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so
great.   Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger picture
is still  very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of
what I would  call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move
to the  upside.

Let me know if this stuff is useful for you. I certainly  don't want to
waste your time. In addition, if you prefer I call when I  have something
to pass along, let me know. I don't know how often you  check/see your
e-mail. Thanks,

Mark Sagel

Sarah-Joy,
Here is an update per your request.

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer.   Any news on this?  

I spoke to John briefly this morning.  Fed-Ex (Memphis) has not been in 
contact with our legal all last week.  John supports our move today to begin 
moving business to UPS.  I have left a message to Carmen to call me ASAP.  My 
message is to inform her of our movement of significant corporate office 
business beginning today. I have every expecation that Carmen will call me 
back this afternoon.  Since the discussions aren't happening, I doubt that we 
will be flying to Memphis, but I'll advise of any changes as they occur.


Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.

Pattillo?  Please send e-mail updates this week to both me and Jennifer 
Medcalf on points a) through e) noted below.

Thanks.

Jeff:
Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit 
confused by the question. 
In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market 
conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.  
Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount 
of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very 
favorable.
I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level.
John

Thx for the spreadsheet.   2 questions : What time frame does this entail and 
does the correlation between the trader and AGG GAS include that trader's 
contribution to the floor's P&L.  In other words, is my P&L correlated with 
the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me?

Web server noticeably slow today.  I'm getting a lot of bad failed trades 
(2-3 seconds behind when I change a price).
Not necessarily slower than yesterday, but definitely slower than a month 
ago.

i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 2.8.  
whther that price level is 425 or 725 is arguable.  i think it's close to 
here.  but when we get to november and we have 2.8 and don;'t repeat the 
weather of this past winter and we have 2.5 bcf more supply and people 
realize that we have 2.3 bcf to withdraw before there are any 
problems...bombs away.

the end of the season is typically the best month to hold. Even if the first 
part of the summer is weak, people will be hesistant to sell the back half.  
Same with the winter.  That's why I'm long H2.  It has good correlation with 
the front on up moves and tends to hold value on the down move.

Hope the London trip is going well!  Thanks for the suggestion below which 
was perfect.  Mr. Thompson called yesterday to confirm that he would be 
working with me to schedule a conference call with the two Kinko's contacts 
early next week.  I'm glad I came in last Friday to send out those e-mails to 
him.

Thanks again for the suggestion.

Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity 
with Kinko's as he sees it.  I would like to forward this on to James 
Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and 
cc Mike Rabon).  Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it 
overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary 
King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?

Thanks for your suggestion!  SJ




Mr. Thompson:

Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband 
Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate 
broadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met Mike 
Rabon in the October 6th meeting. 

Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had 
expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.
IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.
IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.
Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about 
your storage strategy and growth.
Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the 
actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the 
hubs.
Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality 
H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like to 
speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.
Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be 
communicated to the proper person.

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

Russell:
I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill 
Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an 
extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as 
someone "who thinks outside the box".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years 
and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been 
successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.  
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out 
ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed 
out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally 
don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for 
Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within 
reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be 
considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk 
exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an 
independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for 
someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not 
conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor 
his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is 
at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade 
counterparty.

I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread 
option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the 
trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that 
Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This 
was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing 
models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that 
they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental 
price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, 
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within 
variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a 
correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, 
we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this 
methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since 
been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very 
few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.  

Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to 
Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting 
credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade 
considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.
Thanks, 
John

Jim:
The list I gave you is a list of brokers that can clear through you, NOT 
brokers that you clear exclusively.  You do not clear any of my brokers 
exclusively.  All trades that clear through you will be done on discretionary 
trade-by trade basis.  You MUST have your floor personnel reverse everything 
they they told my brokers this morning.

I am not happy.

> 1. Natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit March at
> roughly 700-800 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the
> end of the traditional withdrawal season.
> 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this
> year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or
> production added per rig.
> 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other
> variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and
> industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning
> of winter will be near or below last year's 2,800 Bcf level.
> 4. Thus, it appears likely that the "heat" will remain on natural gas
> prices throughout 2001.
> 5. Consequently, we believe that many E&P shares will post solid gains
> again this year, spurred largely by mounting confidence in the
> sustainability of strong natural gas prices.

they are crazy but mite have to scale in which i have a little and have some
sort of length on,sprd length in the front to hedge weather risk-if ny stays 5
bucks or so above hub seems hard to think jan /feb gonna fall much. also know
aron and some of them "pre rolled" jan/feb goldman rolls not sure if they bot 
em
back, start pxing tomorrow.doubt they have much any impact on the sprd.
    am a bit worried as are most what we must be doing to industrial
demand,switching at huge px sprds. tend to think ealry mid jan y on y stx gap
will fall do to aforementioned and rationing this mkt gonna fall-who knows 
from
what levels?? thots when you have a chance. distillate mkt save for addional
demand it shud be getting from natgas switching wud have been in trouble i 
think
so it will stay discount to gas

Gentlemen:

Thank you for your time this morning. Patrick and I feel this call swayed a 
bit
off track, and would like to make some corrections to the messages that were
delivered today.

Enron is looking for a much deeper and more strategic relationship with HP 
than
a quick storage trade. We see  value in working to define a big picture which
both HP and Enron find rewarding. Ravi did a great job explaining our trading
model, so now you understand the role of the trading desk. Our job is to 
uncover
how best to use the trading desk in whatever strategic structure we build
together.

As we are both Fortune 20 companies, we feel there is a world of opportunity 
for
us together. Your internal initiative of "always on", fits well with our
bandwidth and storage on demand initiatives. We look forward to working with 
you
to figure out the best way to put them all together.

I just briefed Lavorato on the credit issues.  His comment was that Bradford 
is going through defcom 3 over California right now and to give him a week 
when things start to get sorted out there.

the implied market on that from put spreads is 5.3:1.    I'll take 4:1.    
that's all the juice i'll pay.

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

i think thats rite -think curve flattens somewhat.back end the overvalued
part for now. i think we more consolidate sideways choppy for a few sessions
but if the present  rate of injections continue the end users/utilties will
have to stop buying cuz of real phys limitations to take the gas into
storage. funds short but only 6% of open int and have covered later part of
last week.
  think vol comes in again too.i think it sale 4.50 scale up-talked to some
others to o thinking it cant go below 4.00 so i actually think more the
suprise in the short term for a break of 4.00!! so who knows/cud work the
other way.
   agree-disappointed at lack of producer selling-we had one deal come thur
but its been worked for months so not price relevant.
  when are you in town next?

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.
