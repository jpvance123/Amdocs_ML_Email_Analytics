John--this is the recap from Thursday afternoon of RTO week.  Although Andy=
 did not focus on it in his report, there was an individual who sat on the =
panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market =
postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy.  His name is Bil=
l Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp=
ringfield, Missouri.  In his comments he stated that his utility was "whole=
heartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO" and then went =
on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss=
ues if FERC doesn't stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs.
=20
He stated that "flexible" standardization would not work and that the FERC =
should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti=
lity or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or d=
ifferent, then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for a=
n exemption, not the other way around. =20
=20
I'm thinking that this gentlemen would be an excellent choice for a committ=
ee hearing if you have the opportunity to suggest folks to testify in the f=
uture. IF you are able to get transcripts from RTO week, it might also be w=
orth it to review his comments and pass them on as appropriate. =20

RTO Week

=20

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I sent to Kevin the names forwarded to us from Paul for possible panelists from Western governors' offices for FERC's November 2 Energy Infrastructure conference in Seattle.  From the financial community, I sent him the name of Leonard Hyman.  Andy Vesey (the person on Jim's Barton subcommittee panel) suggested Leonard as a possible speaker.  I also spoke with Margaret Morgan (Price Waterhouse and and an EPSA member) to see if she has any ideas, and she too suggested Leonard.  She says Leonard is very knowledgeable about California issues and would be a good speaker.  Margaret is checking with colleagues to see if they have any other recommendations.  I'll keep you posted.

Kevin:

It was good to meet you yesterday.  I decided to watch the Commission
meeting on television so I wasn't at FERC today, but I wanted to pass on
this information to you about possible panelists for the November 2
Infrastructure Meeting in Seattle.

>From Governor Geringer's office, a staff level person is Steve Reynolds
(Wyoming Business Council, also staffs the Wyoming Energy Council).  

    His contact information:  (307) 777-2841.  sreyno@state.wy.us.
Steve is great, pro-RTO, pro-economic development.  

Lt. Governor Ohs (Montana) or Steve Snezak.  The Lt. Governor runs
Economic Development for the State.  

    Steve is the Lt. Gov.'s Chief Policy Aide.  406.444.3111.   

    Both Wyoming and Montana are pro-RTO.  

Other options:  Governor Leavitt is pro-infrastructure development, but
probably not a strong RTO supporter.  

        Jeff Burke (State of Utah Energy Office) is probably the
contact in Utah for this matter if you want a staff person.  

        His contact information is:  (801) 538-5428.
nroerp.jburks@state.ut.us

We are still looking for names to represent the financial industry.  I
will let you know what we find out.  Please let me know if you have
questions.

Per Jim, Enron is going to participate in EPSA's cost benefit analysis for the SE RTO.  Mirant and possibly others have said that they will perform a cost benefit analysis for the Midwest.  We are not going to participate in those.  (Please keep in mind that Enron did the "natural markets studies" for the SE and the NE).  Thanks.

RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussed congestion management.  The panelists were:  Na=
ncy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; C=
arol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkl=
ey and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Gro=
up.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system is not going to change =
in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Opening Statements

Nancy Brockway:  focus on two topics:  1) flowgate vs. LMP; and 2) relation=
ship between congestion management (CM) and resource planning.  She support=
s LMP and standard market design in New England.  Flowgate rights are cumbe=
rsome, create unnecessary uplift costs - freezing power distribution factor=
s is bad and could result in some free rides.  She is a Hogan follower, and=
 Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult.  With regard to th=
e relationship between CM and resource planning, transmission is a monopoly=
, and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision - decide where=
 to site generation or transmission and take a risk.  FERC should not overr=
ide that principle.  Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut cong=
estion management.

Reem Fahey:  RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator.  Ca=
nnot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion.  CM should have=
 a bid-based structure with LMP.  Design of CM should allow flexibility for=
 market participants to be in the spot and forward markets.  Transmission r=
ights - must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hed=
ging in real time.  FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs a=
nd market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load. =
 These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system.

Carol Guthrie:  Her company has diverse interests in electricity market - o=
ver 4,000 service locations, over 150 suppliers, more than 15 sites where t=
hey have industrial generation serving own load (500 MW). =20

Shmuel Oren:  Advocates minimal ISOs, direct assignment of congestion costs=
 in real time, flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralize=
d coordination and supports forward rights.  Does not support "one size fit=
s all."  Need to understand gaming, modes of market failure.  Problems in T=
exas - people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve t=
he congestion.  Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable.

Andy Ott:  There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works=
.  It's an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during c=
onstraints.  PJM has been using nodal pricing since 1998.  Utilities have r=
un their system on this approach for years - economic dispatch to meet dema=
nd.  Cannot do balancing and CM separately -- does not work.  Transmission =
rights must be financial.  Spot market is physical.  Financial model is the=
 hedging.  You need this separation because it allows players to do bilater=
als or buy or sell from the spot market.  Also allows FTRs to be traded and=
 used to protect from congestion. =20

Michael Schnitzer:  There is a preferred method of CM - the LMP based CM sy=
stem with financial rights.  DAM and RT bid-based security constrained loca=
tional pricing markets.  Bilateral transactions are allowed.  Transmission =
rights must be financial, not physical.  Allows transmission users to hedge=
 congestion costs.  Why is CM so important?  Need to get the prices right t=
o give the right signals to the market.  Three goals:  1) get dispatch righ=
t - show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can re=
spond accordingly; 2) price signals to generation for location purposes - c=
larifies responsibility and risk allocations; 3) market signals for when to=
 expand the grid - LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FT=
Rs.

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  The panelists=
 agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tr=
adable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or=
 flowgates are actually more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable;=
 Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

 Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

 Let me know if you have any questions.

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns that the legislation will unduly delay the development of the competitive wholesale power markets that provide consumer savings and reliable power supplies.  The process underway at FERC is on track to produce substantial benefits, and should be allowed to continue unhindered, not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

We should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

Key question: is the "electricity gerrymandering" too tough?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

Northeast RTO Mediation Report

The Commissioners heard a report from the ALJ who presided over the Northea=
st RTO mediation.  As you may recall, the Judge did not support our positio=
n (which was to get a single Northeast RTO up and running, with PJM leaders=
hip and based on the PJM system) by no later than November 2003 (the PJM pr=
oposal).  As expected, the Judge reiterated his disagreement with the PJM p=
roposal and urged the Commission to take a "go slower" approach that includ=
es a minimum 12 month up-front assessment of technology and "best practices=
" determinations. =20

Pat Wood first questioned why the Board makeup should consist of existing I=
SO board members.  He acknowledged that the existing ISO board members have=
 experience but questioned whether the benefit of having their experience i=
s outweighed by the possibility of continued parochial interests that may b=
e retained by these board members.  He thinks perhaps the board should be m=
ade up of totally new board members.  Ironically, in the mediation only a c=
ouple of consumer advocate-types supported this type of approach.  Everyone=
 else believed that using the existin ISO board members makes more sense si=
nce they all have experience.  We supported a board makeup weighted in favo=
r of PJM so that implementation of the PJM system would be assured.  Pat se=
ems to think this presents too much of a political problem.

Pat also expressed concern that FERC not take action that would upset the e=
xisting, functioning markets.  He said FERC should not force a result if it=
 does not know what the outcome will be and could disrupt the existing mark=
ets.  He questioned whether they should take a different, slower approach i=
n the northeast, perhaps putting some regional functions into place soon (e=
.g., interregional transmission planning and expansion) and put off other i=
ssues (a single real time balancing market) that may be harder to implement=
 at first.  Pat says that technology assessment is a big issue and can be a=
 show stopper if it is not done correctly.  Under the PJM proposal, the new=
 RTO would form by the end of the year and would start market design (based=
 on the PJM system) immediately.  Doing an upfront assesment could delay im=
plementation significantly.  He said perhaps some things can be done sooner=
 than 18-24 months.  If he is thinking that long-term is 18-24 months, then=
 we could be okay because the PJM plan takes 24 months to implement.  But, =
his statements on technical assessment are troubling and sound like he may =
be willing to delay the startup of market design until this takes place.

On the positive side, Nora Brownell reminded everyone that New York and PJM=
 have very similar systems but they have a lot of problems working together=
 and that these problems may be a hindrance to the developing retail market=
s.  She seems to think that things cannot remain as they are.

Nothing was decided and it is unclear when FERC will issue an order in this=
 proceeding.  We will keep you posted.

Do we need to specifically rebut this?  Enron did file a study to support the natural markets of the SE, and, while we generally have stated responses to his issues in various forums, do we need to respond item by item?  (FYI--I have never heard the "lake" analogy before -- his characterization of it as the opponent position helps his case, but it is incorrect because as far as I know, there is no one proposing a system that ignores constraints).

Also, we have not focused much recently on the transmission pricing issues.  This may be an opportunity to discuss this in context.  He seems to use it as a reason against the Southeast RTO.

He says they favor wholesale competition, but he then goes on to talk about the virtues of geographically smaller RTOs, with a phased approach of smaller RTOs that could later merge to become larger (although the Barton discussion draft would prevent such mergers).  The statement also chronicles their involvement in the Southeast mediation process.

In his oral testimony, Franklin kept ephasizing the lack of FERC cost/benefit studies on RTOs and the similar (alleged) lack of studies and analysis to support the 4 RTO model.

Barbara--
 
Very helpful and encouraging report.  Sounds like the Gov. and the Consumers Counsel are with us on RTOs.  Would they be willing to write their own letters, I assume separately, to the Ohio congressional delegation? There are several Ohio members on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Is the Consumers Counsel a Democrat (that would help since there are three Ohio Democrats on the committee -- Brown, Strickland and Sawyer?).  Even if he is a Republican, support from within the state would help a great deal.  Thanks.
 
John

Subject: OH Energy Summit -- Summary of comments



Kerry and I attended the Ohio Energy Summit today in Columbus.  Overall, the message on RTOs and restructuring was very positive.  Gov. Taft and Chairman Schriber strongly endorsed FERC's recent moves regarding RTO's. Also, all talk on restructuring is to move forward and not backwards towards re-regulation.  There was also consensus on adopting a national energy policy -- and many speakers linked a national energy policy to national security.

Following is a brief summary of comments from various speakers: 

Senator Voinvich: Supports Congress passing a national energy policy by the end of the year.  His concerns include: need to develop nuclear energy -- said he and Sen. Lander are working on a bill; impact of high energy prices on low income consumers and small businesses b/c we are too reliant on natural gas (did not offer any alternatives to heating w/ gas); the need to harmonize energy and environmental policies (business and environmentalists need to come to the table); very opposed to Sen. Jefford's multi-emissions bill - called it a "threat to Ohio's economy" - said he is working with others on a compromise; new source review problem needs to be fixed; and if new ambient air standards go into effect then entire state of OH will be out of compliance.

Governor Taft: Announced that he is forming a Federal Energy Policy Group to build consensus in Ohio on promoting the development of wholesale markets that will lead to strong retail markets.  PUCO Chair Schriber will chair this group.  The Governor's staff learned this at the same time the rest of us did.  I have asked Tom Winters to follow through with the governor's office to find out what their plans are.  I told him we likely would be interested in having a spot in the group.  He is going to look into this further and get back to me.

The Governor announced that transmission issues, particularly RTOs are his highest priority.  He also announced the Smart Community Challenge Awards for communities that decrease energy use.  Also, October is officially Ohio Energy Month.

Senate President Finan: His comments focussed on the state making efforts to promote use of Ohio coal, burning it cleanly and helping companies afford the environmental technologies so they can burn Ohio coal.

Speaker Pro Tem Cates:  Did not say much other than a coherent energy policy is absolutely necessary. 

Consumers Counsel Tongren: Took credit for success of municipal aggregation. Wants to work with federal government on energy policy.  Laid out questions he has for state and national energy policy.  Rob thanked FERC for their work last week on RTOs

Allen Hill, CEO of DPL:  Said he was very encouraged by FERCs aggressive agenda and that it is important to get RTOs in place and operational as soon as possible.  He supports a national energy policy.  Says industry needs environmental certainty.  Said SB3 will survive b/c it was based on consensus.  Ohio needs to finish rules on supplier defaults.

Jerry Jordan, President, Ind. Petroleum Producers Assocation:  Urged Ohio to stick to the effort of electric restructuring.  He reviewed the history of gas restructuring in Ohio and illustrated how the industry evolved and that it took time.

Tim Timken, Jr., President National Association of Manufacturer's:  Came out strongly in favor of FERC moving forward aggressively on RTOs.

Niel Ellerbrook, CEO, Vectren:  PUCO should look at monthly GCR adjustments. 

Tom Catania, VP Govt. Affairs, Whirlpool Corporation: He is member of NAM, US Chamber and Business Roundtable.  Very pro-restructuring.  Pushed tax credits and exemptions for consumers who purchase energy efficient appliances.

Jim Rogers, CEO, Cinergy: Comments focused on supply and demand balance in ECAR.  Said major factor that is pushing prices up is environment.  Spoke against Sen. Jeffords bill.  Environment is Cinergy's biggest priority.  Said that Ohio should stay the course on competition.

FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell: During our conversation with her, she suggested that we work with Ethan Brown at NGA on the task force with DOE. Chairman Schriber is getting involved in this effort as well.  I will work with Sue Landwehr on this.

Finally, Governor Taft recently hired a staffer for his Washington office to focus on energy issues.  Her name is Sara Sleighter.  She used to work for the PUCO and as an aide in the Ohio House.  Sara left the PUCO when her husband accepted a position as Rep. Tiber's chief of staff in DC.  Sara is very willing to sit down with Enron to talk about our issues.  I will  contact John Shelk separately to discuss.  (Christi -- Sara said you were very helpful to her during the SE RTO mediation -- at that time she worked for APPA's law firm.)

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 614-396-4359.

Great idea.  

My key points would be that (a) FERC needs to push ahead with its "right sized" RTOs and (b) focus on standardizing the tariff and market design [no more collaborative efforts].  Two simple, easy to understand thoughts.  

Also, I think that it's a mistake to use the term "large RTOs".  We don't want large RTOs.  We want RTOs that cover natural markets and benefit consumers.

Below is a link to the prepared testimony of Michael Travieso, Maryland People's Counsel, at the Barton RTO hearing last week.  His comments on the importance of a fewer number of RTOs, each with a broad geographic scope, track our own views.  As with the CFA report by Mark Cooper several months ago, these consumer groups are important to showing third party support for our efforts, particularly among Democrats in Congress.

I have a few thoughts that I think are important:

At the opening of the second paragraph, I would laud him for mandating RTOs for all generators.  That's not insignificant and I think its important to offer some praise with our very valid criticism.

I think we need to take the opportunity to point out that the "right" number of RTOs isn't simply an arbitrary number picked from a hat.  Right now, it seems to be, especially with Pat Wood suggesting last week that CA might not need to be in a west-wide RTO.  Now we're at 6 RTOs.  Do I hear 7?

Lastly, I believe the final paragraph is fraught will peril.  I feel strongly that telling a chairman, or any member of Congress, "this issue is too big and complicated and politicians will get it wrong" is a big mistake, though it's regrettably true in most cases, Dick Armey excepted.  In their view, and probably in the view of most Americans, they get paid to deal with big and complicated issues.  

I believe we also set a dangerous precedent in saying "trust the regulators."  As you note, we're lucky that this FERC mostly gets it.  But the next FERC might not get it.  Nobody knows.  

Our point, that Congress doesn't need to act, has to be made in a more ambiguous way.


The real answer: Don't trust politicians, or regulators.  Trust markets.  Repeal the Federal Power Act.

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns that the legislation will unduly delay the development of the competitive wholesale power markets that provide consumer savings and reliable power supplies.  The process underway at FERC is on track to produce substantial benefits, and should be allowed to continue unhindered, not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

We should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

Key question: is the "electricity gerrymandering" too tough?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate
By Bryan Lee

10/04/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.
The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO. 
The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers. 
FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. 
Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that "a bunch of bureaucrats" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of "what it does for local reliability." 
DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

 RTO Week

Day 3 -- October 17, 2001

Standardizing RTO Tariffs

The morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  

The panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.

General Observations

This panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an "as available" basis.   The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.

I am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.

What Services Should be Standardized?

Overall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  

XCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  

Should FERC Retain CBM?

Ricky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.

Network Versus Point to Point Service

Peter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  

Should all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?

Most of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.

What Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?

Jim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize "as available" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.

Ray Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

On this same subject of Chairman Wood, I am told that he met with Rep. Doug Ose (energy subcommittee chairman of the Government Reform Committee) and Ose's "energy advisory board" on Wednesday of this week and said similar things.  He made a big deal out of a Big Mac analogy -- saying that whether you ordered one in Portland, Oregon or Portland, Maine the product is the same.  With RTOs, he supposedly said this meant if the rules are standardized, the number of RTOs becomes less important.  Those in the room, including EPSA staff, came away with the impression that Wood is backing away from only 4 RTOs based on this and other comments.  Ditto on a 12/15/01 deadline.  On the positive side, he did say that he had been consulted on the Administration's comments on the Bingaman bill and agreed that legislation without RTO language or bundled/unbundled is OK.  He understands the high risk that Congress would go the wrong way on these issues.

For those who attended the FERC meeting yesterday, can anyone elaborate on the reference in the Energy Daily article today that said Pat Wood remarked at the meeting that the Barton RTO language is "balanced" and that he likes it.  I am working on our own and helping EPSA with their comments on the Barton language which is, as we know, a retrenchment from current law and FERC's plans on RTOs.  But if Pat Wood likes it and thinks it is "balanced" that undercuts our position.  Since the trade press is not always accurate, I thought I would first check with those of you who were there.  Thanks.

Per the documents below that were sent to you on October 10th regarding Enron's RTO positions, please DO NOT DISTRIBUTE them.  Unfortunately, there were factual errors that were not identified until today.  
 
I will send everyone a replacement set next week.  
 
Thank you and I apologize for the confusion.

Virtually everyone wants us to move forward, define some market rules, define some new tariff rules, so that a little guy, a trader in Arkansas that wants to trade in Maine, can do so easily without having to understand rules for 17 different RTOs. I think this is a banner week for RTO policy. I think we finally have political will for bold, decisive action. We've got a head of steam up. We're going to move quickly." - FERC Commissioner William Massey on RTO week.

Rick:  now will you quit picking on poor bill?

The EPSA Leg. Affairs Committee is having a special meeting this afternoon (out of the normal biweekly cycle) to discuss how EPSA should respond to the Barton RTO discussion draft.  In addition to the e-mail yesterday morning, I spoke in person with Gene Peters of the EPSA staff to convey our strongly held view that mere "technical corrections" were not enough to fix the Barton RTO proposal, as the EPSA draft letter stated.  Gene came around because in a subsequent meeting we had with Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS), a member of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, Gene said that silence would be better than what is in the Barton draft.

He did indicate to me (not to Pickering) that some EPSA members, without naming them, didn't want to come down too hard on Barton because in their view the draft could have been worse.  These unnamed companies (or company?) claim to have told of earlier versions not released that would have been more restrictive on FERC's discretion.  Some companies also think FERC could wiggle out of the strictures of the draft.  I told Gene that there is no way to wiggle out of the definitions of minimum size/scope that FERC would be forced to accept and the various procedural advantages for recalcitrant utilities.

While I am checking with counterparts at other EPSA members in advance of the afternoon meeting, you might want to do the same as you speak with contacts at other EPSA members.  I am confident we can get the EPSA letter to better reflect our position -- my suspicion is that the unnamed company Gene referred to is Reliant, but I can't prove it. 

John

(although I am interviewing a potential hire from 3-4 p.m.) if you wish to
discuss.

FYI.  The Harvard Electricity Policy Group maintains a web page with recent
papers on "Standard Market Design" for restructured electricity
markets.  You can reach this page at:

http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/hepg/standard_mkt_dsgn.htm

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has announced plans for a
rulemaking proceeding on a standard market design.  You may find these
papers of use.

Rick, 

Note Sarah's message below that we encouraged Gail to seek out Nora at next week's NARUC meeting.  Do you want to give Nora the heads up as to our conversation with Gail.  I think we've made progress with Maryland and it is ripe for Nora to seal the deal.  I assume you will be talking with Nora soon, otherwise I am glad to call Kevin.   (We will be following up with Steffes on his ideas, too.)

Great news.  Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms. McDonald thinks we should visit with?  

On the idea of NYISO vs. PJM, I was reading in Restructuring Today yesterday about some elements that NY thought was better than PJM.  I think that we need to "find" three things to give to the NYISO in the development of a single market...allocation of FTRs comes to mind.  I agree that PJM and its staff are the key elements, but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that NYISO does something well??

Should we do another round of New England meetings to push our support - with McGreevey winning in NJ, will the NJBPU change its focus?

Jim

Subject:	Lunch with Gail McDonald (MD PSC)

Linda Robertson and I had lunch with Gail McDonald, Maryland PSC commissioner, yesterday in Baltimore.  Linda knows Gail and her husband (it's an old Oklahoma thing), so Linda arranged the lunch for us.

On the RTO front, Gail told us that the MD PSC is not opposed to one Northeast RTO.  They see it as inevitable but they do have concerns about the "contamination" problem (i.e., PJM is a good, functioning ISO, New York is not, and Maryland does not want PJM to be contaminated by New York).  They were particularly troubled by FERC's statements that "best practices" from New York and New England should be included in the new Northeast RTO.

I told Gail that we are very aligned with their position.  I said we believe PJM is the best market in the U.S. and the ISO is a sound, independent organization.  I said our traders like the liquidity of the western hub, and our goal has been to spread PJM throughout the rest of the Northeast.  I told her that we too are concerned about contamination from New York, which is why we worked so hard to endorse a plan that put PJM firmly in control of the development of the new RTO market design and of the new RTO.  We discussed how New York and New England are opposed to weighting the board towards PJM, but that we believe (and presumably Maryland would support this position) that the new board must be weighted by PJM board members to ensure proper implementation of the PJM model.  At a minimum, PJM must be in charge of implementing the new market design.

Gail also said the MD PSC thought the seams process should be worked out before a single RTO is in place.  I explained to her the problems of the MOU and that we (and most market participants) do not believe that the three ISOs will ever be able to work out the seams issues as long as they remain separate entities.  She was not familiar with the MOU process but seemed to agree that if the seams were not resolved by the entities over the last two years, that it is unlikely that they will ever been resolved.

Gail is going to NARUC next week (she's on the gas committee, which Nora asked her to be on earlier this year), and we urged Gail to find Nora and discuss these issues in more detail.  We told Gail that Nora (coming from the Pennsylvania PSC) understands and agrees with the concerns raised by Gail, but that Nora seems to believe that the way to fix the problem is to implement PJM throughout the Northeast.

Gail also asked about the State/FERC initiative and asked what happened with the Regional Reliability Organization concept.  I told her I will look in to it and get back to her.

As we were finishing lunch, Gail said our discussion was very helpful for her to better understand the issues surrounding a Northeast RTO.  She also said she will try and "turn down the rhetoric" from the PSC.  Linda and I again encouraged Gail to talk with Nora next week, and we said we hoped that we (Enron) could work together with the PSC to ensure that the right RTO is implemented in the Northeast.

Linda and I were quite pleased with the lunch and are hopeful that we can get something going with Maryland.  Ending Maryland's opposition to a Northeast RTO would be extremely helpful in the political debate that seems to be taking place.

Let us know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah

JOhn--I just had a chance to review his testimony and I just don't think we could ask for a better (and still be believable!) statement from a consumer advocate.  I was thinking that although this is testimony before COngress, it would also be good cover for FERC.  Do you or Sarah or Christi know if FERC does or can include Congressional testimony in their analysis or can they only use formal intervention type documents?  I was just thinking that whoever interacts with FERC in the DC office could make sure that they have a copy?

Below is a link to the prepared testimony of Michael Travieso, Maryland People's Counsel, at the Barton RTO hearing last week.  His comments on the importance of a fewer number of RTOs, each with a broad geographic scope, track our own views.  As with the CFA report by Mark Cooper several months ago, these consumer groups are important to showing third party support for our efforts, particularly among Democrats in Congress.

Sam -- Here are some thoughts we had for the Motion (plan to file 9/4/01).

For those not committing to join a big RTO:

No market based rates
Lower rate of return
No further stranded cost recovery
FERC opines on allowing a "safe harbor" on tax issue for those divesting
No innovative rates (could be a carrot too for those that join)
For non-jurisdictionals -- loss of all reciprocity tariffs/ subject to pancaking
Loss of native load exception
May be some other items that Pat Wood used as incentives in Texas

I have to respond in the SE RTO at 3:30 Houston time today and have a brief 4:00 conf call, but Sarah and I could either chat after that or on Monday (my cell 713-301-3421).

Thanks and we are happy to have you helping us!  Christi

I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.

In addition, California's response of "DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -=

."

I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat=

 MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET"..because "FEATURES OF THE RESTR=

THE ELECTRICITY MARKET."

Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (toge=

Subject to receiving more information, my recommendation is not to make a "=

John,

My take on the paper is that is wasn't particularly flattering to the gener=
ators/suppliers.  It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had=
 addressed and that the ISO did not implement.  It is reasonably sound as f=
ar as "history of the formation" is concerned but some of their statements =
and conclusions I have to take issue with. =20

Off the top of my head, they use the term "idle".  In my mind as a utility =
person, idle means available but just not running.  As they apply the term,=
 they use it to describe any unit not running, either because it was forced=
 off or was off for maintenance, I realize it's only a word, but it carries=
 many different inferences, mostly unfavorable.  Early in the document they=
 refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding su=
pply to manipulate the price.  They never substantiate this claim.  In fact=
 as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case sho=
wing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high pric=
es, but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have und=
erstood the full picture.  They also don't really touch on the lack of supp=
ly side response.  According to Greg Conlin, the President of the P{UC when=
 AB1890 in CA was designed, was a key part to the equation, they spend litt=
le, if any time discussing how this part of the puzzle never developed.  Th=
ey also give insuffucient explaination of the "per-se" reasonablness clause=
....There are other more specific instances I can send to you at a later ti=
me.

I left my notes on the document back in my office, I can give you a summary=
 early next week if that's OK.  I am currently fact gathering about PJM and=
 NYISO congestion models with Steve Walton for RTO West...

Jim,

Last week some time I had been on the distribution of a paper published by =
the CBO entitled, "Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis".  In re=
viewing this paper several things struck me.  The paper is not particularly=
 accurate, they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse, they ign=
ore the lack of implementation of demand-side response programs that were s=
upposed to be a integral part of the AB1890 and they use inappropriate term=
s, such as "Idle" when describing plants that were unavailable because of m=
aintenance or repair.

My reason for writing is to ask you, how politically influential is a paper=
 like this?  Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on =
problems, especially with those associated with the problems experienced in=
 CA?  And if so, because of some of the mis-representations it contains, do=
 we want to develop a fact sheet for our folks in DC to use to refute some =
of the claims made in this paper?

Thanks,

Rick:

Here are a proposal from Richard to analyze the benefits through a detailed modeling approach.  He assumes the Mirant study can be used in the Northeast and the Midwest (provided they do one), but he does not include in the proposal pulling all of this data together to come up with an analysis nationally of the benefits of RTOs.  Presumably that would not be the bulk of the cost of the project.  I am sending next the Seabron proposal which is different from Tabors, so it's good to see different approaches.  

Larry Ruff has not returned by calls.  I know he was busy with the ICAP affidavit, but he should have called me by now.  I'll  try again.  I'm also going to see what kind of ideas the Brattle group (Peter Fox-Penner) has.  

There was a lot of discussion about the need for a cost benefit analysis during the Thursday morning RTO conference with the State Commissioners, so this remains an important project.  We need to discuss timing.  Neither Tabors nor Seabron can work on this immediately due to the California refund proceeding, but they could do the work if we were to submit a study along with comments in the NOPR proceeding (which would likely be due mid-December).

Let me know what you think.  

Sarah

Sarah

Attached are three RCR requests for doing the C/B studies for the Southeast
and the West

Several assumptions are built in.

1.	The desire is to have an analysis that is pretty air tight, i.e. not
assertions but analyses
2.	Mirant has done the NE (we have the evidence of that) and it is also
pretty air tight.  I can't prove this from the PUF article but the numbers
look pretty good and we know EEA and they do good work
3.	Mirant is going to do / is currently doing the Midwest.  This bye
the bye is as big a headache as the West so hopefully they are focusing on
the challenges there - like is it possible to have it be a single RTO?
4.	To do the west we need to do two things.  A.) coordinate with what
we are doing for the people in RTO/W.  Ellen will need to do some talking
with them as we go on this.  B.) do a market description analysis as we did
for the SE, NE, etc.  It MIGHT be possible to skip this but it would be
dangerous.  Our take is that there are really two (possibly 3) "natural"
market areas in the west and that a single RTO would not make a lot of
sense.  This is empirical at this point so figuring it out would be good.

The obvious point is that for us to do this will require serious resources
(you are used to that).  It is a tiny bit worse making it fit in 8 weeks max
but that looks OK given current staffing and other things that are underway.

Let me know where you are on this when you can.

Many thanks

Following up on last night's e-mail, here are some specific suggestions to strengthen the draft EPSA letter on the Barton RTO draft.

The second paragraph and the first few bullets after it should be rewritten as follows to make it clear that the current legislative proposal on RTOs is far off the mark as opposed to being fixed by "technical corrections" as the draft letter now states:

You have identified RTOs as critical to the development of a well-functioning transmission system, and we wholeheartedly agree.  We commend you for including all transmission-owning utilities in the RTO provisions and for requiring that transmission be conducted on an open-access basis.  However, to accomplish the RTO and transmission goals we share, it is essential that any legislation on RTOs not slow down the process already underway at FERC.  Unfortunately, the discussion draft as issued on October 9th does not meet this test.  Specifically, the proposal

Establishes a lengthy and cumbersome process that will delay the formation of RTOs by imposing procedural requirements that advantage those who oppose properly functioning RTOs, including evidentiary hearings and court appeals review under standards of judicial review not normally applicable to Federal Power Act cases.  

Removes the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to deal with an evolving marketplace by statutorily freezing market and operational structures in place as of date of enactment regardless of changed circumstances.

[rest of the bullets as in the draft letter]

We appreciate the opportunity to offer these suggestions to strengthen the draft letter.  Please call with any questions or comments before the Legislative Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow.  Thanks.

John

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns that the legislation will unduly delay the development of the competitive wholesale power markets that provide consumer savings and reliable power supplies.  The process underway at FERC is on track to produce substantial benefits, and should be allowed to continue unhindered, not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

We should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

Key question: is the "electricity gerrymandering" too tough?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


>From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

I spoke with Craig Glazer (PJM Wash Rep) yesterday afternoon regarding the status of the northeast RTO efforts.  As you may recall, we, along with many other market participants and PJM, advocated a Board makeup for the new Northeast RTO board of 5 PJM Board members, 3 NY board members, and 2 NE board members.  New York and New England are pushing hard for parity - 3 from each board.

PJM is concerned that FERC is going to take the political way out and go with parity.  Our concern with this approach has always been that if all three ISOs are equally represented, progress will not be made in forming the new RTO because the other two ISO board members will retain their bias and preferences for their own ISO sturucture, and development of the northeast RTO will be delayed indefinately.  These three ISOs have been working on the seams issues, through the MOU process, for the past 2 years and absolutely nothing happened -- no progress was made.  FERC recognized this in its July 12 order on mediation.  

If FERC does take the political route and order parity on board makeup, then it is imperative that FERC issue a clear, unambiguous order directing that the PJM system be implemented, that not many changes are made to the PJM platform (in the form of "best practices" from other ISOs), and that the new Board members' fiduciary duty must be to the new RTO.  If they go this route, we would also want FERC to require that PJM management and staff be the Project Leader in seeing that the new RTO gets up and running.

Other issues of concern are:

California Audit
	See ISO report and generators response (generators' response is attached -- faxed ISO's report)

Congestion Management
	Preference for ERCOT system?
	Preference for PJM type system?

Types of cost/benefits analysis that would be helpful
	Would a Mirant study in the midwest be helpful?  One in the southeast?  One for the entire country showing general benefits of regionalization?

Talk to you soon.

Sarah

It looks like Brownell is staying the course on RTOs.  See the highlighted part of the case below.  This case is about a customer wanting the right to buy ancillaries at market based rates.  The Commission denies the request but Brownell uses the opportunity to make the point that RTOs will provide customers more service options and choices that are not available today, services that customers are asking for.

United States of America                  
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION 


     Carolina Power & Light Company               Docket Nos. ER01-
                                    	              2301-000
                        			                           and ER01-2301-001

                         (Issued November 1, 2001)          

     BROWNELL, Commissioner, concurring:

          In this order we accept Carolina Power & Light's proposal to
     makes sales of certain ancillary services at market-based rates. 
     We find that the proposal is consistent with certain conditions
     as set forth in Order No. 888 and our policy in Avista
     Corporation, 87 FERC   61,223 (1999) (Avista). 

          In Order No. 888, and subsequent cases, the Commission
     required transmission providers to offer certain ancillary
     services at cost-based rates as part of their open-access
     transmission commitment but also contemplated that third-party
     suppliers (that is, parties other than the transmission provider
     in a particular transaction) would also provide ancillary
     services.  The Commission left open the possibility that
     ancillary services could be provided at other than cost-based
     rates and stated it would entertain requests for market-based
     rates by third-parties if supported by analyses that demonstrated
     the seller lacked market-power.  In Avista the Commission set
     forth several criteria that allowed a third party to make sales
     at market-based rates, without making such a demonstration.  The
     Commission concluded that the protection of the cost-based
     backstop under the open-access tariff in conjunction with the
     criteria set forth in Avista provided an appropriate and
     effective safeguard against potential anti-competitive behavior.

          North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC), in
     the case before us, claims that for the portion of its load on
     CP&L's system, CP&L is the only game in town because no other
     entity offers such services in the control area.  NCEMC believes
     that the rates under CP&L's market-based rate tariff may be lower
     than the open-access transmission rates and may offer a greater
     range of products and thus that it should have the opportunity to
     purchase ancillary services under CP&L's market-based rate
     tariff. 

          NCEMC's request underscores the value that an RTO can bring
     to the region.  First, access to information, standardized rules
     and procedures (including generation interconnection) and
     comparable access to the transmission grid - - all things that an
     RTO can bring or enhance - - should incent additional suppliers
     of energy and ancillary services in CP&L's control area.  Given
     the opportunity, a third party supplier will have 

                                     2

     an incentive to compete business away from the transmission
     provider, if it is profitable.  Second, control of the
     transmission system by an independent operator should mitigate,
     if not eliminate, concerns of anti-competitive behavior and








     affiliate abuse and thus produce greater options for customers -
     - ones that NCEMC appears to be seeking now.  

          CP&L did not request to sell ancillary services at market-
     based rates to customers on its own system and we do not direct
     CP&L to do so.  I believe that the order is consistent with prior
     orders and Commission policy.  I also believe, however, that
     today's order has not satisfied NCEMC's needs and has not
     advanced customer choice or flexibility, both of which I believe
     are necessary for the wholesale competitive markets to thrive and
     can be advanced through RTO formation.
                                        
           
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                   
                                        Nora Mead Brownell
                                        Commissioner

 10  October, 2001
To: James D. Steffes,  Enron
From: Enron  Forum
Content: Intellibridge has compiled the following report  in response to your request.
Request:
What  would be the amount of installed capacity of each of the FERC RTOs (assuming  Californiais ultimately in the  Western RTO) and what is the total peak demand in each  area?
 
Response:
 
Intellibridge estimates the following peak demand and installed capacity  figures for each of the four proposed FERC RTO regions based on the most recent  complete data available.  Peak load  data sets that were deemed complete and reliable are for 1999. Installed  capacity information is from forecasts made by NERC for 2001.
 
[IMAGE]
 
 In response to FERC  Order 2000 of 6 January  2000, utilities throughout  the United  Statessubmitted proposals to  form Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) for coordinating and controlling  electric power grid systems in their area.   FERC responded to these proposals on 12 July 2001, in a series of orders  that made clear the Commission's vision of four large, regional RTOs making up  U.S. bulk power markets.  FERC said  in these orders, "We favor the development of one RTO for the Northeast, one RTO  for the Midwest, one RTO for the Southeast, and one RTO for the  West."
 
Though the eventual shape and scope of the regional RTOs remains in  question, estimates of capacity and peak demand can be made based on groupings  of North American Electricity Reliability Council (NERC) regional councils or  regional ISOs and bulk power markets.   For the purposes of estimating installed capacity and peak load in these  regions, the following groupings of NERC regional councils and ISOs were assumed  to correspond to the four RTOs proposed by  FERC:
 
Northeast:
?         PJM
?         ISO-New England
?         New York ISO
 
Southeast:
?         Southeastern Electric Reliability Council  (SERC)
?         Florida Reliability Coordinating Council  (FRCC)
 
Midwest:
?         Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP)
?         Mid-American Interconnected Network, Inc.  (MAIN)
?         Southwest Power Pool (SPP)
?         Eastern Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement  (ECAR)
 
West
?         Western Systems Coordinating Council  (WSCC)
 
Peak Load  Data:
FERC  Form 714 hourly load data were used to calculate coincidental peak load for the  Midwest and Southeast RTOs.  FERC's  most recent, complete set of Form 714 data are for year 1999; FERC is still  collecting data for year 2000.  Year  1999 data were consequently used throughout for the sake of consistency.  Peak demand for the Western RTO was  taken as the 1999 annual peak reported by NERC for the WSCC in its year 2000  "Summer Assessment".  Coincidental  peak demand for the Northeastern RTO was calculated from 1999 hourly load data  available on the PJM, ISO-New England, and New York ISO web sites.
 
Installed  Capacity Data:
NERC  Electricity Supply & Demand for 2001. While some sets of this data for 2001  are estimates, it can be assumed that the Summer 2001 installed capacity data is  reasonably current. Other estimates can be made available.

Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues from both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

All commissioners were present.  Shelton Cannon was the moderator and facilitator.  Purpose is to have intensive discussion to develop FERC guidance.  Focus is on functions rather than characteristics - what should and should not be standardized?

 Midwest Commissioners' Presentation

Several Midwest commissioners were invited to make an opening statement.  David Svanda, Michigan PSC, made the comments.  He said Midwest state regulators believe there are arbitrary boundaries between ARTO and MISO.  State regulators worked hard on the settlement that includes single rate and IRCA.  MISO and ARTO have not resolved critical issues and now there needs significant bolstering of the IRAC effort.  Would like to work with FERC on details of Midwest issues.  They propose to create a Joint Board between FERC and State Regulators, pursuant to section 209 of the FPA, to formalize a FERC/midwest partnership.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Although this was an issue to be discussed by the second panel, the issue was raised in the first panel when the discussion centered on ancillary services.  Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

Standardized Markets

Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Breathitt asked whether there could be an entirely bilateral market with no mandatory balancing market.  All of the panelists agreed that you must have a real time energy market even with bilateral contracts.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet, the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

ICAP

Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Brownell said she thinks the ICAP debate is one that needs to be resolved now, before RTOs are put in place.  She wonders whether ICAP requirements are needed in the interim until RTOs, with working markets, are up and running.  Not many of the panelists agreed with this, saying temporary ICAP requirements will not send the needed signals to build.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?

Steve Naumann said he assumes two Midwest RTOs, but most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Midwest Commissioners' Proposal to Have a Joint Board

Massey asked all the panelists what they thought of this idea.  None of the panelists, even the Connecticut commissioner, thought this was a good idea, citing the inevitable disagreements and problems that will arise, and the risk that such a Board could slow down progress.

 

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

We'll have both Facts about FERC's RTO Order talking points and the Bare Essentials piece to distribute during the joint meeting of the Electricity and ERE committees' discussion of the draft on Monday morning.  I think that should cover our bases.  If you have any edits to the documents, let me know.

Are you sure?  It seems to us that what you mentioned to Lynne is closer
to Section V, C, 3.  What section of IV is the problem?  We'll have all
of our recent RTO handouts at NARUC to distribute.

Rick, what section of the draft specifically is it that you spoke with
Lynne about?  I'll see if we can come up with some alternative language.

As you know, the Commission last week issued several important notices and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to address over the next few months.  These issues are extremely important to Enron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve (most) of these issues for many years.  There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act, and we need to be ready to respond.  

In an effort to coordinate our efforts, we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives.  The Washington advocacy group will also work closely with all of these teams.  If someone is interested in a particular issue and was not included on that team, please feel free to call the Project Lead to have your name added to the team.  All assistance is welcome.  As you will see on the attached chart, many of the deadlines for responding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks, so the teams need to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly.

On the attached chart, we have listed in the left column each of the FERC initiatives that will be starting or are currently underway.  A "Project Lead" has been named for each initiative.  The Project Lead will be responsible for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in the proceeding.  The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the next couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward.  The team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues should be addressed, what is the best way for Enron to respond to them, and producing draft comments.  Once draft comments are prepared, the comments will be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enron's important issues.  

There is a column of "Inside Counsel" and "Outside Services."  In some areas, we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not.  Where we do not list outside counsel, we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments (with significant input from the team members).  Please remember, however, that even if outside services are listed, the RCR process must still be followed.  If applicable, Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible.
The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lead named for each proceeding:

RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:  Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding.  The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October 15-19, and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels.  Comments will be submitted to FERC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  This team will also be responsible for these comments.

Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead.  Comments are due in approximately 45 days.  Several issues are raised in this proceeding, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal.

ICAP Inquiry:  Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead.  Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit expert testimony on this issue.
California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation:  Alan Comnes will be the Project Lead.  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaking season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will be starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be needed this winter.  This team will be responsible for both of these proceedings.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  Steve Walton is the Project Lead.  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  -- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues.  The team will also oversee the progress in these proceedings.
Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead.  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required, including at least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.  Comments are due on October 5.
California Refund Proceeding:  Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead.  The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact.  
Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  Bob Frank is the Project Lead.  The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  Briefs will be filed in response to the decision, and the Commission will review the Judge's order.  
Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Mike Roan is the Project Lead.  Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocating, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly.  Proceedings may be ordered.
Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead.  Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before October 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.
Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead.  Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before October 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.

I am working on an analysis of the details of the Barton draft RTO language.  While it is highly objectionable and our goal is to kill it, to do so we need to respond to requests to be specific about why we don't like it.  One of the more objectionable provisions says that FERC can't change the scope, governance, etc. of any RTO that has been "approved" under Order 2000 prior to enactment of the legislation.

If this applies to PJM, the legislation would stop the Northeast-wide RTO in its tracks since several of you and PJM's Phil Harris testified last week that FERC has "approved" PJM.  By contrast, committee staff and the section-by-section they distributed on the RTO legislative proposal say that to date FERC has NOT approved any RTOs under Order 2000.  They say that the legislative language would not apply to any RTO as of this date because FERC approvals of PJM, Cal ISO and NePool have been approved under the "ISO principles" of Order 888.

Your thoughts on the above would be helpful. Either way, I think we can argue that the provision shows why the Barton proposal is a retrenchment rather than an advancement on RTOs.  If it does not apply to PJM and the others as they contend, there is no good reason to include it other than to "freeze" the process at FERC merely by having the legislation pending on the Hill, much less enacted into law.

HEADLINE: Southern Co., Regulators Clash in Power-Grid Fight 

BYLINE: By Matthew C. Quinn 

BODY: 
Southern Co. appears to be on the verge of losing a big-money power struggle over control of its four-state electricity transmission system. 

But both sides in the tug-of-war offer different takes on which result would help consumers and which would hurt them. 

At issue are long-distance transmission lines, mounted on huge steel towers, that carry electricity across state lines to towns and cities. Atlanta-based Southern Co. has invested $ 3 billion in its 26,000-mile system, but federal regulators want it to cede control to a larger agency that covers eight states. The matter is coming to a head now after three years of wrangling. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wants to carve up the country into four regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, for the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West. Under such a plan, local utilities like Southern would be unable to stop competing power shipments from out-of-state suppliers. 

Regional transmission organizations "yield significant customer savings," said FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. Commission spokeswoman Barbara Connors said lower rates will result when barriers to competitively priced electricity from outside the region are dropped and transmission costs reduced. 

But there are sharp differences of opinion on that score. 

Andy Dearman, Southern Co.'s chief transmission officer, cites estimates that a super-regional agency could cost more than $ 100 million to establish, and he says those costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates. According to Georgia Power Co., a Southern Co. subsidiary, transmission costs already account for about 6.5 percent of Georgia electricity bills. 

There's also a question of reliability when a new system is established, Dearman saud. "It impacts the ability to keep the lights on," he said. 

Some state regulators, who stand to lose regulatory control, see a Washington power grab. 

"We've got low prices and a reliable system," said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Stan Wise, who sees a back-door move toward utility deregulation of the sort that has failed with electricity in California and been severely tested with natural gas in Georgia. 

"Don't tell me about the new system when I've got blood on my face from the last battle," Wise said. "There are some parallels that make us squirm." 

PSC Chairman Lauren "Bubba" McDonald wrote President Bush following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks urging a delay. "This is not the time to consider or implement any change to the management of the nation's transmission grid," he said. 

But the federal commission has only toughened its position. 

Wood, a Texan recently named chairman by Bush, said last month he wants to use the commission's authorities as a "stick" to force reluctant utilities into line. Wood would deny utilities that refuse to join a "new world" of regional power grids by Dec. 15 the authority to charge deregulated prices and delay merger approvals for those firms. 

The commission plans a series of workshops in Washington next week for what Wood called the "brightest minds available" in the utility field to brainstorm over transmission reorganization plans. Southern Co. is sending a representative. 

Companies like Enron Corp., the Texas-based national energy suppler, are pressing for RTOs as the first step toward a national transmission grid -- a concept favored by the Bush administration. 

Prodded by federal regulators, Southern Co. in June agreed to dilute its control over the 26,000-mile system by joining with public power agencies in five states to form a larger, 39,000-mile transmission agency to be operated by an outside company. But a federal mediator rejected the plan. 

The issue has also split Southern Co. from onetime subsidiary Mirant Corp., an independent power company with plans to expand into the Southeast. 

Large regional grids are "more cost-effective and reliable" than the present territorial hodgepodge, said Mirant spokesman Buddy Eller. 

By encouraging development of new and cleaner power plants, the environment would benefit too, he added. 

But Wise called such predictions "totally unproven."

Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate
By Bryan Lee

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.
The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO. 
The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers. 
FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. 
Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that "a bunch of bureaucrats" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of "what it does for local reliability." 
DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing. 
The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits. 
"We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest," the Public Power Council testified. "Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good." 
"Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest," declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities. 
"The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small," said a group of aluminum producers. 
Similar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast. 
'RTO Week' 

FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during "RTO Week" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate. 
"I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now," Wood said at an "energy community" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va. 
Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting. 
The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings. 
Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits. 
During the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators. 
Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as "economically dangerous." 
Arnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC. 
The state regulators want "an opportunity to be at the table," McRae said. If such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted. 
FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was "blindsided" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate. 
Later in the day, Wood told reporters that "RTO Week" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators. 
At the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition. 
"This process needs to be goosed," said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders "an external catalyst" to get the process moving. 
"If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that," he said.

Subject:=09Teams for Upcoming FERC Proceedings


As you know, the Commission last week issued several important notices and =
papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to ad=
dress over the next few months.  These issues are extremely important to En=
ron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve (most) of these iss=
ues for many years.  There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it=
 is ready to act, and we need to be ready to respond. =20

In an effort to coordinate our efforts, we have developed coverage teams to=
 respond to these FERC initiatives.  The Washington advocacy group will als=
o work closely with all of these teams.  If someone is interested in a part=
icular issue and was not included on that team, please feel free to call th=
e Project Lead to have your name added to the team.  All assistance is welc=
ome.  As you will see on the attached chart, many of the deadlines for resp=
onding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks, so the teams nee=
d to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly.

On the attached chart, we have listed in the left column each of the FERC i=
nitiatives that will be starting or are currently underway.  A "Project Lea=
d" has been named for each initiative.  The Project Lead will be responsibl=
e for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in t=
he proceeding.  The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the nex=
t couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward.  Th=
e team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues sho=
uld be addressed, what is the best way for Enron to respond to them, and pr=
oducing draft comments.  Once draft comments are prepared, the comments wil=
l be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial =
people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enron's important issues=
. =20

There is a column of "Inside Counsel" and "Outside Services."  In some area=
s, we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not.  =
Where we do not list outside counsel, we will rely on our inside counsel to=
 draft the comments (with significant input from the team members).  Please=
 remember, however, that even if outside services are listed, the RCR proce=
ss must still be followed.  If applicable, Project Leads should submit the =
necessary RCR request as soon as possible.
The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lea=
d named for each proceeding:

RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:  Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will =
be the Project Leads in this proceeding.  The RTO meetings will be held in =
Washington from October 15-19, and we hope to have an executive from Enron =
make a presentation on one of the panels.  Comments will be submitted to FE=
RC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  This team will also b=
e responsible for these comments.

Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead.  Comments a=
re due in approximately 45 days.  Several issues are raised in this proceed=
ing, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's =
marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is=
 a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commissio=
n to adopt this bold proposal.

ICAP Inquiry:  Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead.  Chairman Wood has=
 indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requireme=
nts, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the=
 market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we p=
lan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit exp=
ert testimony on this issue.
California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation:  Alan Comnes will be th=
e Project Lead.  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the Calif=
ornia ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended t=
o cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proc=
eeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, =
a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the curr=
ent price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps i=
n an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaki=
ng season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will b=
e starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could disc=
ourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be =
needed this winter.  This team will be responsible for both of these procee=
dings.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  Steve Walton is =
the Project Lead.  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission cons=
traints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  =
-- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission p=
lans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a hig=
h priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated tha=
t it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to id=
entify energy infrastructure issues.  The team will also oversee the progre=
ss in these proceedings.
Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  Susan Lindberg is the Project =
Lead.  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market partici=
pants to provide more information than is currently required, including at =
least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a signi=
ficant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of c=
ommercially sensitive information.  Comments are due on October 5.
California Refund Proceeding:  Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead.  The Commis=
sion has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the Califor=
nia ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a h=
earing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact. =20
Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  Bob Frank is the Project Lead.  The J=
udge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that re=
funds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  Briefs will be filed in =
response to the decision, and the Commission will review the Judge's order.=
 =20
Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Mike Roan is the Project Lead.  Various f=
ilings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTO=
s in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocati=
ng, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO =
in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly=
.  Proceedings may be ordered.
Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead.  Mediation to=
 create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pend=
ing before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before Oct=
ober 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.
Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead.  Mediation =
to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pe=
nding before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before O=
ctober 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.

Jurisdictional Disputes Intensify
As FERC Seeks to Extend Its Authority=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Dow Jones] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (F=
ERC) kicks off a week of workshops today as part of its effort to reframe r=
ules requiring utilities to turn control of their power-grid assets to inde=
pendent management. The controversial effort to carve up the nation's elect=
ricity system under control of four or five regional transmission organizat=
ions (RTOs) is a top objective for FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. The workshop=
s, dubbed "RTO Week," were called by FERC to garner what Wood calls "buy in=
" for the effort, which is encountering stiff opposition from some utilitie=
s, state regulators and members of Congress.=20

Analysis: The objective of this week's workshops may be to gain support fro=
m the industry for FERC's controversial mandate, but they are also having t=
he effect of casting light on what is a growing debate over FERC's jurisdic=
tional boundaries. The issue has become rather evenly divided. On one side,=
 critics say that FERC has gone too far in its most recent RTO order, which=
 as noted has become somewhat of a "cause c?l?bre" for new Chairman Wood. O=
n the other hand, supporters say Wood has breathed new life into the commis=
sion and is taking an important step to ensure equal access for all power s=
uppliers into the nation's transmission system. By Wood's own directive, th=
e discrepancy over how far FERC can extend its regulatory oversight into wh=
at were previously considered state or utility matters is reaching a boilin=
g point, as a Dec. 15 deadline that carries stiff penalties for resistant u=
tilities is fast approaching.=20

Certainly, the arrival of Pat Wood as FERC chairman (after replacing Curt H=
?bert last month) has signaled a new era for the federal commission, which =
oversees much of the energy industry's wholesale market and the nation's po=
wer grid. As noted, Pat Wood has made the formation of RTOs one of his key =
objectives. Wood recently demonstrated that FERC would become much more int=
erventionist when he declared a deadline of Dec. 15, by which time transmis=
sion-owning electric utilities across the country must submit plans to join=
 an existing RTO in one of four large regional entities. Using what he has =
referred to as a "big stick," Wood warned that failing to comply with the D=
ec. 15 deadline would cost transmission-owning utilities their right to cha=
rge market-based rates for power and could delay any merger proceedings in =
which the utilities might become engaged.=20

This issue alone has drawn a line in the sand, but has also sparked an inte=
nse debate on the regulatory power that FERC should be given in the deregul=
ating energy market. Standing up to lead the effort to put more constraints=
 on FERC's authority are many state regulatory officials and congressional =
leaders, who view the commission as stepping into areas in which they tradi=
tionally have been the sole jurisdictional gatekeepers. State regulators, p=
articularly from Southern states where electricity prices remain comparativ=
ely low, argue that that their system is working just fine the way it is. S=
uch states want to retain their present regulatory oversight (rather than c=
ompletely forfeit control of these assets over to FERC), and also believe t=
hat now is not the time to be making huge changes to the way in which the n=
ation's transmission system is managed. Also in question is the extent to w=
hich regulatory conflicts may arise between state and federal commissioners=
 if FERC is successful in mandating very large and broad RTOs that transcen=
d state boundaries.=20

Southern Company is one utility that has refuted FERC's authority to force =
it to participate in an RTO. In its July order, FERC directed Southern Comp=
any (along with the Southwest Power Pool, Entergy Corp. and Grid South) to =
form a single RTO for the Southeast region, most likely adopting a structur=
e modeled after Grid South. However, Southern Company already has sunk abou=
t $3 billion into its own 26,000-mile system, over which it wants to retain=
 independent control.=20

FERC has said that the formation of regional RTOs will result in significan=
t cost savings for customers because the barriers to competitively priced e=
lectricity will be removed and transmission costs will be reduced. However,=
 Southern Company claims that the cost to establish a large regional RTO co=
uld run as high as $100 million, which could be passed on to customers in t=
he form of higher rates. Southern also disagrees with FERC from a philosoph=
ical point of view and questions whether or not the commission's vision of =
four regional RTOs will truly make transmission activity more efficient. On=
e of Southern's concerns is that the four regional RTOs could become too la=
rge and end up operating like monopolies. Ironically, the issue has caused =
dissension between Southern and its former subsidiary Mirant, which as an i=
ndependent power producer seeks equal access to the transmission grid. Whil=
e Southern disagrees with FERC's authority to force RTO participation, Mira=
nt supports the federal government's efforts to streamline transmission act=
ivity.=20

Leaders of RTO West-the transmission entity in which FERC wants to include =
the transmission assets of states in the Northwest, Southwest and Californi=
a-also question the value of a large regional entity and are resisting FERC=
's authority to mandate this structure. Leaders in the region have said tha=
t the formation of RTO West would result in substantially higher rates, con=
sidering that the Northwest transmission grid currently lacks the capacity =
to meet high demand in the area. In other words, although FERC may be endor=
sing market-based rates for those transmission-owning utilities that join R=
TOs, some transmission grids remain unstable and may not be ready for incre=
ased activity.=20

Nevertheless, along with Mirant stand fellow generating companies such as D=
ynegy and Enron, which have sunk billions into building merchant facilities=
 and want to ensure that they have access to transmission systems. Hence, t=
hese companies agree with FERC's emphasis on RTO formations, as generation =
companies want to ensure that control of transmission facilities is moved f=
rom utilities to independent management companies.=20

In addition to the RTO issue, the bankruptcy proceedings of Pacific Gas & E=
lectric Co. have also brought the issue of state versus federal jurisdictio=
nal authority to a head. The utility's parent PG&E Corp. is pursuing a "rin=
g fencing" strategy in the restructuring related to the bankruptcy proceedi=
ngs of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Put simply, PG&E Corp. is trying to prote=
ct other valuable assets by transferring them into a new, federally regulat=
ed subsidiary. The restructuring plan has raised jurisdictional issues beca=
use the California Public Utility Commission, which presently regulates the=
 utility operations of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., believes that it has the=
 right to approve the transfer of assets into a new subsidiary. Further, th=
e state government in California believes that PG&E Corp.'s plan would give=
 too much regulatory control to FERC, and by the same token reduce the amou=
nt of control that California would have over generation assets that are pr=
esently contained in a regulated subsidiary.=20

The complicated issues surrounding how far FERC should be allowed to extend=
 its regulatory authority are presently working their way through the feder=
al legal system. In fact, last week the Supreme Court began hearing argumen=
ts from federal lawyers, state regulators and private industry, addressing =
not only FERC's authority to mandate RTOs but also the commission's 1996 or=
der that required utilities to provide equal access to their transmission s=
ystems. Measures are also moving through Congress that would clarify the Fe=
deral Power Act to explicitly give FERC the authority to mandate participat=
ion in an RTO. At present, the commission had danced around the issue by ca=
lling for "voluntary" participation, yet still affixing stiff penalties for=
 utilities that refuse to comply.=20

In addition, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the Energy and Air Qual=
ity Subcommittee, is reportedly working on a broad electric restructuring b=
ill that he hopes to introduce during this congressional session (which cou=
ld prove difficult as legislators want to close the current session by earl=
y November). Barton is a strong supporter of RTOs, and his draft bill repor=
tedly would give FERC the ability to order RTO membership for public and pr=
ivate utilities that own power lines. At the same time, however, it is beli=
eved that Barton's draft bill would give utilities the option for an expedi=
ted federal court hearing if they disagree with FERC's order, which again w=
ould further temper the extent to which FERC has unrestricted authority on =
transmission issues.=20

Moreover, Congress and federal courtrooms may be the best venues for this d=
ebate over FERC's authority as disputes between state and federal regulator=
y oversight are sure to increase as thorny deregulation issues emerge. Howe=
ver, given FERC's deadline of Dec. 15 for RTO participation, the issue has =
gained a sense of urgency as big utilities such as Southern Company dig in =
their heels and rebuff the federal commission's mandate.=20

My comments --

I assume that in the Enron filing we will make a stronger argument for sticking with the 12-15-02 date?  Also, critical to highlight that the FERC should have one "major" change date, not multiple given the liquidity problems with significant regulatory change.

Finally, break out competitive retailers in the list of the ONE RTO Coalition. Every state inside this region (except VT) has competitive retail access.  Furthering this effort with further the policy directions of the states by lowering wholesale prices and making business "easier" for companies like EES.  We should play this up.  We are really pushing hard on the physical retail gen side in NYC and Boston and taking another look at PA and MD - this is the real benefit - that consumers' bills go down.  I didn't see that language on consumer benefits.

Rick, Jim and Susan:

Enclosed is the One RTO draft comments on the Northeast Mediation.  We would like to include Enron as a signatory party to the comments, so please read them to make sure that you are okay with us signing on.  Although the date issue is somewhat amorphous (we support PJM (with a Nov 2003 date but we also urge implementation as soon as possible -- Dec 2002 if possible).  

This was the best we could get the Coalition to agree to -- there are many parties who strenuously opposed advocating any date early than Nov 2003 and I had to threaten to take our name off the comments if we didn't say something about an earlier date.  We have not given final signoff, but they would like to hear from us by the end of the day (comments are due tomorrow).

Susan, please show the comments to Kevin, Dana, Paul (and anyone else who would like to see them).  We are also writing our own comments, which we will circulate by COB today for filing tomorrow.  They do not need to read the affidavits -- just the comments to make sure we're not saying anything they disagree with.

Also attached is the Henning affidavit that supports the Mirant study.  Although Mirant probably did not make the best choice in using an internal regulatory person to do the study presentation at FERC, everyone who I have talked to thinks that FERC staff reacted favorably to the study's findings.  One person overheard FERC staff say that they expected $440 million in savings per year, and they weren't questioning these savings, but wondered if these were enough savings to justify a movement to one RTO.  It seems to me that $440 million is significant savings, but who knows.  Anyway, we need to discuss whether we want to join in the Mirant Midwest study.  Provided that a similar study can be conducted in the midwest (since there are no ISOs there), with a similar good outcome, I think we should consider supporting the Mirant effort.

Please let me know what you think.  Thanks

Sarah

Participants:

-Prof. Charles Cicchetti, Univ. of Southern California
-Comm. Robert Nelson, Mich. Pub. Serv. Comm.
-Marji Phillips, Exelon Power Team (attorney)
-Sonny Popowski, PA Office of Consumer Advocate
-Craig Roach, Boston Pacific
-Anjali Sheffrin, Dir. Market Analysis, Cal ISO

Summary:  Market Monitor (MM) should be independent.  Too much MM transparency is a problem -- MM function should be done privately to FERC.  MM should be an early warning signal.

Specifics:
The morning started on a rather humorous note with Marji Phillips introducing herself as "the guilty party so to speak in front of you" (referencing the PECO/Exelon purported violation of standards of conduct).  She stated that it is not the role of the MM to interfere to make sure that power prices are the lowest in each hour -- the MM should monitor the RTO and the markets and be part of a creative solution (without imposing its own MM penalties/mitigation).  She used the Midwest price spikes of 98 as an example, and stated that a poor MM would probably have worsened the market solution that was reached without intervention.

Most of the group agreed with Prof. Cicchetti that the MM should not be the policeman, judge and jury.  He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).  As Craig Roach said, the MM should look at more than market power -- it should also look at market conditions and market rules and be a vehicle for innovation.  Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not "go to the farmer for costs."  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.  

Many thought that there should be some standardization of the information provided to the MM.  Most agreed that the information should be provided on a confidential basis, especially before any specific problem has been found.

Sonny Popowski stated that the RTO must be truly independent or the MM simply catalogs the market failures.

Comm. Nelson said that the MM should have unfettered access to all costs and should have the ability for "cease and desist" orders.  Also, stated that ITCs/transcos should be monitored to the extent that they favor transmission solutions over DG and generation.  On the very positive side, he said RTO policy should proceed.

Ms. Sheffrin said that it would be simple to implement a rolling 12 month cost plus 10% competitive benchmark, and prices above this should be mitigated.  She said this would allow bidders to "self police" so as to not hit the benchmark.  Most of the others disagreed with her, pointing out that a simplistic test such as this does not account for market conditions.  It was pointed out that there were too many different MMs in Cal with no one acting.  Someone also commented that one reason participants did not want to turn data over to Cal ISO was because it was a contesting party.

All thought that DSM should be included in the market in order to be considered in mitigation.

Comm. Breathitt asked Ms. Sheffrin why the price cap wouldn't work in Cal.  She responded that the problems in Cal were with the need for LT contracts and other issues (she also said that it is not a zonal/lmp issue).  Importantly, she said that consumers are now conserving 3000-5000 MWs annually since getting the appropriate price signals.  Mr. Popowski said that he likes the price caps in PJM.  Margie countered and said that "icap" in PJM is the problem.  

FERC staff asked if the MM should monitor bilaterals.  Marji said absolutely not (between consenting companies and should not be unraveled).  Both agreed that the MM may at times need access to these in order to understand what was happening in the spot market.
