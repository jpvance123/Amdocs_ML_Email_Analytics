The PPA auction is going along well I think.  We are leading on Sundance B 
and have been for 3 rounds now.  Some weird things are occuring so it is too 
early to tell what will utimately happen.  The government has said that it 
will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning.  We 
would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on Sundance B.  
Currently we are bid  $112,000,000 Canadian and a swap price of 33.5 CAD.  
But again its too early to get our hopes up.

Please give me an update on the overall status of Chris Dorland relocation 
from Calgary to Houston.  As Lavo has already indicated to you, Chris will be 
joining the East Power Trading group as the PJM cash trader.  Chris is 
anxious to get the process rolling so he can make the transition to Houston 
no later than October 2, 2000.  In particular the following package needs to 
be put together and overnighted to Chris this week.

 1) Visa paperwork (Canada to US)
 2) Relocation specifics (move coordination & $'s for move)
 3) New US salary (Chris expectation is $80k/yr US)

Please give me an update as soon as possible.

Thanks David.

Subject: GRMS Slowness

I said at yesterday's meeting that I would get back to you concerning the 
speed issues of the V@R calculations - here's the response...

I spoke with Steve Stock, the Director of RAC systems.  He agreed that there 
are performance problems and this is being addressed in a technology review 
being conducted by my application architecture group.  There are plans to 
re-architect the application so it can handle real time calculations.  Once 
the results of the review are known - I will be more than happy to share them 
with you.  The V@R process currently takes 11 hours from start to finish.  We 
also find this unacceptable!

Also, the front end is very slow in accessing data.  There is a new front end 
in development that will address these problems.

I'll keep you posted as new developments occur.

Beth

We need to think about trying to get more VAR for the gas floor before all 
these other commodities go to the Board and scare the hell out of them.  I 
have several reasons for this so lets discuss.

John,

Here are the simulations for:

Normal roll:  (same as before, but included for completeness)
No Roll: (liquidate position at end of each month)
Roll to fill price gap

I have included in place of the Roll P/L, the cumulative price gap over all 
the contract rolls ($/bbl).   Negative value means a backwardated market.


Normal Roll No Roll  Fill Gap





Will send the same set of runs for 2nd last day later this morning.

Subject: Updated WTI Trading Simulation

John,

The updated model does not give answers too different from the earlier 
version.   The changes made were in correcting the handing of contract rolls 
and correcting some of the roll dates.

The model still gives a higher profit, sometimes, for the cases of 1,000,000 
bbl position limit vs.  5,000,000 bbl limit.   I took a look in detail at the 
5 MM bbl case which gave lower profit (3 yrs out of Nov 95).   The intuition 
is that there are two offsetting things which happen when you raise the 
position limit.

1) you have a larger position to profit from when the market reverses a 
trend, but
2) you loose much more money in a long term trending market, and to the 
extent that you still hit your position limit, you will not make it all back 
when the market reverses.

In the specific above case, you hit the position limits for both 1 MM bbl and 
5 MM bbl, and the superior strategy is a trade off between limiting losses 
vs. having a larger position from which to gain on major market reversals.

Subject: N.A. Systems



I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list 
of agreed apon tasks.

1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we 
have huge business risk if it blows up. 

 -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to 
maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  
        (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds 
like it should be a high priority)

2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to 
long hours on the part of our back office staff.  

 -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to 
address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are 
expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add 
hardware and reduce the time problems.

3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately 
combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real 
time risk.
TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the 
traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by 
the               traders to meet their needs. 

 -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in 
consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to 
come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.

4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is 
leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made 
progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the 
next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.

5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin 
Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements 
deals and volume management deals in the east.

6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).

7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their 
books through an interface with Houston.  

 -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its 
worthwile to put servers in Portland.    

 -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering 
all his needs.

John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas 
desk VaR dropped to $3.8


Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think 
it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider 
sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, 
maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to 
both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them 
to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts

Ed, sounds like you have this handled - I would like to use your report as 
the example to use in other groups.  It can wait until you have it all 
completed.  You may want to think about EOL as well (ie) how many companies 
have you brought on-line, etc.

 summary:
  - coverage metrics;
  - market iniatives;
  - completed deals;
  - hot list;
  - EOL metrics.

Subject: Monthly Mid Market Coverage Report

Dave:

I want to be sure I am on the right track for providing you ,John and Kevin 
with meaningful account coverage data. I envision a one page 
summary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage 
ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set 
at 100%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards 
would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commercially 
active customers. Less active or inactive customers would be contacted at 
least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose 
product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each 
commercial team's coverage effectiveness or lack thereof.  I will 
derive this summary from a master customer list that will show contact dates 
and specific comments on customer status. I anticipate this master 
list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list 
quarterly in order to corroborate the monthly summary. Do my proposed 
coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations?

In addition, I have asked my commercial teams to prepare regional business 
plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans will be
identification of major new business initiatives by sub-region. Tammy 
Shepperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this week. I 
don't want to provide you with something "half-baked".  Is it acceptable to 
allow my commercial teams to complete their plans then provide
you with our suggested initiatives by July 13 ? 

Finally, I have provided Tammy with reports on 1st/2nd quarter completed 
transactions plus a deal flow "hot list" .

Sorry for being verbose. Please advise. 

Thanks,     Ed

Subject: APEA Gas Sale: Force Majeure by Clark PUD

Dale,

Further to my phone call this morning, I have contacted John Watts at Avista 
requesting a copy of the Force Majeure letter they are sending to APEA.  I 
will forward this as soon as I receive it.  The event in this case is 
preventative maintenance.  It appears that there are stress fractures in 
certain of Clark's generation equipment.  GE is installing equipment to 
assess the problem.  The installation and removal of this equipment will 
involve an outage totaling 5 days over the next 2 weeks.  The question is:  
Is preventative maintenance a legitimate Force Majeure event under the 
APEA/Clark contract and thus under the APEA/ENGMC contract?

Thanks for your help,

Laird

John,

Terrell Benke was a summer Associate from the University of Chicago who has 
just accepted Enron's full-time employment offer.  Erik, her husband, 
currently works at Goldman Sachs as a junior trader in Chicago.  Therefore, 
since Terrell will be moving to Houston, Erik is very interested in pursuing 
potential trading opportunities at Enron.

Please look at his resume and inform me if you have any interest in his 
background.

Regards,

Jean

Here is my resume. I would like to interview and meet people in natural gas

can reply to this e-mail or reach me at home at 773-667-6740 if you need to
get in touch with me.

John,

FYI Clickpaper should be up and running by the end of the month.  We will be 
quoting mostly the same products as we currently do in EOL (except longer 
term and one new physical offering).  We will also continue to make quotes on 
EOL but probably with a wider spread.

Some newsprint stuff for you.  As with any other commodity, the inventories 
and operating rate/capacity are the key drivers.

John,
I left a copy of Nelson Ferries contract with Kim Hillis.  Nelson signed this 
draft and returned it to me today.  Please advise on how you would like me to 
proceed with this contract.

John, Jeanie Slone and I met with Nelson on Friday to discuss the contract, 
and I think that Nelson was seriously considering not signing it.  He told me 
that he would get a response to me on Monday(Fred L had given him a deadline 
of last Friday).  I do not have an email from Nelson or JEanie today so he 
may not have gotten back to anyone.  Jeanie, could you get a copy of Nelson's 
contract from Michelle or Twanda and drop it off with John?  Could you also 
touch base with Fred Lagrasta and see if Nelson has made a decision?  Thanks.

Sir,

I could not e-mail these reports to Kimberly Hillis as usual because I was 
getting the mail returned for insufficient disk space.  Kimberly should be 
able to print from your e-mail.  I also sent a back-up copy to Tim's

Some of the traders interviewed Key on Friday and unfortunately he didn't

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook 
the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year 
for the next five.

Thank you very much for your support of me and Enron in the annual Summer 
Stroll for Epilepsy.   The event took place this past Saturday and was a lot 
of fun.  Your generous donation of $50 enabled me to pass my personal goal of 
$3,000 by $65. Thank you!!

We have been asked to collect the money by Friday, May 19, so if you will 
call me once your check is ready, I will be glad to pick it up.  Please make 
your check payable to the Epilepsy Foundation.  Thank you again for your

This memo follows up on our discussion this morning.

With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to 
Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following:

1.  5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from 
the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).

2.  Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the 
trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).

3.  With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the 
"Cross Commodity Trading Group" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and 
use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only 
employee).  This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we 
need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading 
groups staying within their VAR limits).  However, I do see the need for a 
true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability 
trades accross the commodities that we trade.  This structure may help to 
start us down this path.

Please let me know what you think.

John

All of a sudden Mark Frevert asks me everyday about when we'll know about 
hedging re PPA's and if we can delay the auction 2 weeks.

The dream is still alive.  

Let's see my boys come through.

Northland Power (a power plant operator) from Toronto has joined hand with 
Nepco to build a large cogen plant in BC with possible power off-take 
agreement for US Pacific NW (Washington/Oregon). Northland power asked me if 
Enron would be interested to quote indicative prices for this project. Would 
you please advise me with who is responsible for this kind of projects?

Thank you very much for your support of me and Enron in the annual Summer 
Stroll for Epilepsy.   The event took place this past Saturday and was a lot 
of fun.  Your generous donation of $50 enabled me to pass my personal goal of 
$3,000 by $65. Thank you!!

We have been asked to collect the money by Friday, May 19, so if you will 
call me once your check is ready, I will be glad to pick it up.  Please make 
your check payable to the Epilepsy Foundation.  Thank you again for your 
donation and support!

I am working with CIBC on another credit mitigation deal.  They are 
interested but they have said nothing yet on pricing levels.  I am sending 
them something on Monday that will propose a Enron payment on Friday December 
17th of approximately $16 MM CAD.   Again, this payment would come from the 
U.S. office so if there are any administrative things that need to get done I 
suggest we get on it quickly.  I assume Juanita needs to deal with funding 
and Louie needs to secure a letter from CIBC re credit mitigation.  I'm in 
Houston part of the week but you can track me done through my secretary.  

Regards

Sorry I didn't get back quickly.

You need to tell me what the premium translates into from a dayrate 
perspective.  In addition, I thought you were going to write an outline of 
what they would try to do in the next little while. (ie how much one way 
exposure)  This way I don't have to get involved in every deal until they 
prove to me that is big enough to allocate a risk manager to the market.

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook 
the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $1.05/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year 
for the next five.

Subject: Authorized Traders

Gentlemen (and I use the term loosely!):
Now that you have been duly authorized by the COO and CRO of Enron to have 
global risk responsibility, you need to authorize the individual responsible 
for each individual commodity group delineated in the Risk Management 
Policy.  I took the liberty of making a stab at it for you.  Please review 
attachment and let me know if you have  any changes.  If ok, I will forward 
to you for your signature and on to Rick Buy to make official.  These 
individuals will then be responsible for designating those that can transact 
on their behalf.  
Any questions, please call me asap. 
Ted x3-3324

I just realized that you do have "financial desk excluding futures" on report.

Get rid of the other "financial desk" and when you aggregate it exclude the 
futures trades.

We can make this even simpler.  All broker trades are confirmed the next 
day.  We would only need to record trader deals when they deal direct which 
is rare and all marketer deals.  If we do this we might consider keeping the 
tapes for a longer period because only the confirming part would be on tape.  

Please advise.

John, I thought I would send you a note to outline our conversation re. David 
Redmond.  Dave will return to the London office in late May.  In late 
February we will pinpoint the group/job that will best suit Dave and Enron.  
All efforts will be made to get Dave an option trading related position. 

Regards,

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

		 Subject: Enron Direct Systems for Canada

Mark and Beth;

Further to our discussions, I have followed up with Beth to talk about 
resources to build the Enron Canada retail business.  She has suggested the 
we use Cap Gemini to help convert Daniel's systems for the Canadian 
business.  I have also given Beth a name of a systems guy that came 
recommended that would be an employee here to help translate the differences 
in the markets and would ultimately be the Dan Maitland of Canada to look 
after the product as we build the business.

I think that it would be very helpful to have Daniel involved in the scoping 
due to his familiarity with the systems and the settlement requirements with 
the wires and pipes companies.  If Daniel could direct the development out of 
London, that would be great as well.  I heard that he did a great job on the 
Spanish effort.

Dave Delainey and John Lavorato are supportive of building this business here 
and the Canadian president(Rob Milnthorp) is also keen to grow this 
business.  I think that we can be much more effective using the UK systems 
than trying to build our own from scratch.  I would rather build this without 
looking to the EES IT resources out of Houston, as I believe that we will be 
more successful importing the latest ED systems and modifying them for this 
market in time for market opening--just 2 months away.

I really appreciate your help on this, and hope that we can work together to 
deliver another success to Enron as a whole.  I'm sure glad that I know you 
guys as I know that I will end up with a product that works for us.  Don't 
worry, I will not try any coding myself.

Best regards to you both, and I hope you are staying DRY in wet old London 
Mark.

Cheers,

Dave

end in conjunction with the PRC process.

We will wear the ICAP position with the following marks that represent the 
true mid.

 2001 2.00 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2002 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2003 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)

These new marks result in $9 million of incremental value that will hit 
Dana's P&L tonight.   Based on our discussion earlier, East Power (Dana 
specifically) is now fully wearing this position and fully assumes all 
downside and upside associated with the position.

I wonder with Joe Sutton gone if they can cancel the worldwide Analyst and

Subject: Final Associate/Analyst 2000 PRC - Jacoby

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

I know that you'll give me hell for this but I'm out of town for my 
Sister-in-Law's wedding that weekend.

you meet me Tuesday morning with all the deals they have with us.

My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well 
with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are 
very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should 
slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire.  
I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on 
International business.

John

Get Chris Abel on my schedule early Monday.
Also can you make sure that I have a computer set up for me in Portland and 
Calgary and that it gets me into my network.  I especially need to be able to 
get into the executive reports.

The number of trades doesn't seem to match between your presentation and the 
spreadsheet data.  The spreadsheet shows 17 power trades this year and your 
presentation shows almost that many every month.  Same comment for the gas 
side.

Subject: Approval for transfer to EBS

John:

My name is Husnain Mirza. I have been working for ENA as Senior Specialist.  
I work in Andrea Reed's group, and report to her through L'Sheryl Hudson.  On 
August 8th, on behalf of Andrea Reed, L'Sheryl Hudson told me that with the 
dissolution of CTG, Andrea's group would change significantly and that there 
would be  no growth opportunities for me in this group. I was told that I 
should look for opportunities and growth elsewhere. 

After talking to numerous people in Enron, I found someone who told me to go 
to EBS. In EBS I approached Paul Trieschman of HR and Larry Lawyer. Paul 
Trieschman said he would check in EBS and forward my resume to people who 
might be looking to fill in vacant positions. Larry sent me to Ravi 
Thuraisingham, who was looking for someone with telecom background. Ravi 
talked to Jim Fallon, who was also looking for someone with telecom 
background. 

My background in Williams Communications Group, Inc., and specifically 
working on Fibre build business plan and related subjects, like cost study of 
fibre capacity, provided a direct fit with the position that Ravi and Jim 
wanted to fill. Ravi, after asking what I had done at Williams 
Communications, went to discuss my background with Jim Fallon. In the 
afternoon he called and made me an offer to join EBS. I accepted the offer. 
He told me that the projects that I will be doing are about Fibre build.

Upon receiving the offer, I went to Andrea Reed and told her about the offer 
and the excellent fit that this position has with my telecom background.  I 
told her that this position gives me great opportunity to make contribution 
to Enron's broadband efforts. Andrea, knowing that there are no growth 
opportunities for me in her group,  said she fully supports my transfer to 
EBS. She has already called Paul Racicot and told him of her support for my 
transfer to EBS (Please see Andrea's email below).  

Jim Fallon and Paul Racicot, understandably, are very sensitive about my 
transfer to EBS. They want to finally check it with you and get your support 
for my transfer. Everything related to my transfer has been finalised, except 
that Jim and Paul want to hear directly from you and get your approval.  
Andrea Reed fully supports my transfer and has no concerns about it. I would 
appreciate if you could O'K my transfer to EBS. I do not want to miss this 
opportunity, and would like to start as soon as possible.

Regards,

Husnain Mirza

I wasn't double counting.  My 5 Million was the Cross commodity group.  I'm 
fine with your comments re. Sherriff.

John,

We are working with the traders and have pushed the responsibility for 
building consensus on Phillip Allen.  I just wanted to keep you in the loop.  
Any assistance that you can offer is greatly appreciated.

		 Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


>From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

As part of the info you should put together I thought it would be good to 
have the historic head count (for 1-2 years) by month and by level to try to 
get a sense of how many people we hire.  Might even need the number of hires 
and fires/resignations.  My thought is to try to figure out how difficult it 
would be to have a few committees to interview candidates before offers would 
be made.

John,

Sorry to bother you with this but, we are working with these cities to assess 
the extension of their gas supply contracts with Engage.

The price under the Engage contracts is effective July 1st - June 30th of 
each year and is based upon indices in the US Southwest and Alberta for the 
previous 12 months.  Thus, we can project the price for the contract and 
compare it to our forward curve (at AECO) to determine the best course of 
action:  extend or terminate.

The following summarizes the comparative pricing I need.  If the analysis 
indicates that these contracts should be terminated, Enron would be in a 
position to supply gas to these entities at AECO.

Quantity:    8,000 MMBtu/d baseload
Term:     July 1, 2000 - June 30, 2001
Delivery Point:   NIT (AECO)
Pricing:    Fixed in $US/MMBtu

Thanks for your help,

Laird

I'm going to extend and offer to someone who currently works at Koch.  I will 
extend the offer at the Director level but this person could easily pass as a 
Vice President.  I think I need to add some stock or options to the offer.  
Can you please advise me on how I can accomplish this.

Thanks

On Ed Graham.

I pushed the issue with Cliff and Kevin Hannon.

Kevin, Cliff and Jeff Donanue (current head of M&A for Broadband) met on the 
issue after I talked to them.  They have decided to give him 6 months to 
perform or he will be let go.  His bonus for 2000 will be 0. 

I know you wanted a different outcome but this is the best I could do.

If you bring Dina some cheesey (spelling) 80's movie on DVD like "16 Candles" 
she would be in heaven.  We got a crazy cold spell last week but it should be 
gone when you come.  In case you guys want to go to a nice place to eat you 
might want to bring some casual pants but for the most part jeans should be 
fine.

John, I thought I would send you a note to outline our conversation re. David 
Redmond.  Dave will return to the London office in late May.  In late 
February we will pinpoint the group/job that will best suit Dave and Enron.  
All  efforts will be made to get Dave an option trading related position.

Regards


John Lavorato

Subject: Requested information on Transport

John,

I want to update you on the additional information you requested yesterday 
(intrinsic and extrinsic $ assigned to each deal when originally booked).  

Due to changes in personnel, the time that has elapsed, and the Excel model 
used in the original valuation of the deals, obtaining the initial values has 
proven to be more of a challenge than I had initially anticipated.  I am 
working with the current book administrators for the transport model to pull 
together what information we can find.  I have also spoken with Colleen and 
placed phone calls to the prior (and original) administrator of the transport 
option model.

I am not sure, at this point, that we will be able to pin down the original 
values for all of the deals.  I will get you what I can, as soon as I can.  
In the meantime, please let me know if you have questions and/or concerns.

Greg

Subject: collar structure





John,
Doug asked me to send you the amended model for the proposed collar structure.
You will see that is is essentially a larger version of the previous model, as
it covers the full calender year of 2000.  There are therefore 48 options 
which
results in daily volume being reduced to 42K GJ/Day.  There is an amortization
schedule to the far right which calculates the implied interest rate on the
deal.  Call me if you have any questions about the model or changes you would
like to see.

Through the course of the year 22 people have been identified by east power 
as the key to their real time group.  No request will be granted on an 
emergency basis but will go through the usual process of getting facts and 
checking with me.  Another thing is that I don't know why we are not doing 
these things in conjunction with PRC so late in the year.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

Guys,
This Enpower calc issue is a joke.   How can we be the most Innovative 
Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.  
Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our 
power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, 
settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.

In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because 
they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on "holidays".  This 
whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt 
with accordingly.

Please advise.  Thank you.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the 
power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

Subject: athena vs quark

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our 
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power 
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

We actually forced Craig Breslau and Fred Lagrasta to unwind an unapproved

John,

In general, results are not too different from last day roll.    For "no 
roll" and "roll same position" strategies, the 2nd last day seems to 
outperform slightly more often.

Let me know if you would like to 
1) look at quarter to quarter earning volatility of these strategies or
2) look at effect of incorporating some transaction costs for 
rolling/liquidating positions.

I hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong.  I think we need 100% 
of reviews done.  Do you agree.

I totally support having a separate marketing and trading team in Ontario to 
focus on the opening of that market.  However, with respect to creating a 
redundant physical system operation/real-time unit monitoring/dispatch 
function in Ontario, it simply does not make economic or logistical sense.  
With the integration of the  6 peaker plants into our operation and the 
associated IT support, control area operations, plant operations, hourly 
trading, and real-time monitoring system here in Houston, we could provide 
all the necessary tools and support personnel necessary to perform this 
function from Houston.   All the critical trading information would obviously 
be available to the Ontario office, yet they would not have to be burdened by 
the additional overhead to build a stand alone physical operation.

>From my standpoint, it just doesn't make sense to re-create the physical 
capabilities the Houston office has developed over the past two years.  The 
Ontario guys are doing a great job and I like their aggressive attitude, 
however, rationale business decisions should still prevail.

Your thoughts?

Attached is the data you requested today.   The schematic detail requested 
can be found in the email attachment at the bottom of this email.  Please 
also contact Ed Baughman on the TIE proposal for dispatching, scheduling and 
trading services that was recently done to leverage of the existing Genco 
facilities and staff.

On the dedicated ring downs all work was co-ordinated by Darren Adamik 
(713-853-4764) if you require additional details.

Generally it will take 4 staff for a 24 hour operation plus one vacation/sick 
relief.  Depending on the complexity of the operation you will have to 
determine the level of industry expertise.  A good plan would be to hire a 
senior lead utility type and then bring on junior staff.  The quality and 
quantity of staff will likely be based on the value at risk and the 
complexity of dispatching these units. 

If you consider the operation critical a diesel and UPS will be required.

Plasma displays run $10,000 to $15,000 per display plus any switching/av 
equipment.

We have a PI consultant on contract that could be available for your PI 
project - typically $ 150.00 per hour plus travel and expenses.

The above assumes that no special hardware/software is required from The IMO 
to dispatch these units.

Subject: Alberta Power Purchase Arrangement Auction

I have considered on a preliminary basis the potential use of a limited 
liability subsidiary of Enron Canada Corp. for the purposes of bidding on the 
PPAs.  The issues and preliminary answers are in summary the following:

1. It is not clear that Alberta would permit qualification of another Enron 
Canada entity at this point.  I believe that it would be more sellable if 
that Enron Canada entity was a replacement to Enron Canada as a Qualified 
Bidder, rather than an additional Qualified Bidder, and if that Enron Canada 
entity was similarly guaranteed by Enron Corp.  I need to discuss this matter 
further with Rob Hemstock, Alberta and Charles River.

2. With respect to the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as mentioned, it is not free 
from doubt, but I believe that the Guarantee is only in respect of bidding 
on, and paying for a PPA and not for ongoing performance or payment 
obligations under the PPA.  In other words, the Guarantee guarantees 
"Obligations" which relate to the bidding process and not to the PPAs 
themselves, although there is some wording which could be viewed as including 
in "Obligations" ongoing obligations with respect to the PPAs themselves.

3. With respect to limiting liability, such Enron Canada entity would limit 
exposure for a successfully acquired PPA to the contributed capital to such 
Enron Canada entity, assuming the Enron Corp. Guarantee would not extend past 
the bidding process as noted in paragraph 2 above, and subject to the common 
law relating to "piercing the corporate veil", which in essence means that 
the limited liability protection of a shareholder through a corporate entity 
can be looked through if the courts determine that the corporate entity was 
established merely for the purposes of avoiding liabilities properly 
attributable to the shareholder.  Although this is a difficult test to prove 
given the intended purposes of corporate and other limited liability 
entities, it is best to establish the limited liability entity in such a way 
that it has the greatest appearance of an operating company (for example, a 
separate board of directors, separate management, separate employees, 
separate operating agreements and leases, etc.).  As mentioned, however, it 
is all a matter of degree and generally speaking it is difficult to establish 
a case where the courts will allow the "corporate veil" protecting 
shareholders to be "pierced".

4. With respect to capturing tax losses incurred in the limited liability 
entity, if Enron Canada is the sole shareholder so that there is no change of 
control on a winding-up into Enron Canada, Enron Canada can avail of tax 
losses incurred in the Enron Canada entity through a winding-up.  Obviously, 
however, this would mean that Enron Canada takes on the liabilities of the 
special purpose entity as a result of the winding-up, including the 
liabilities for any acquired PPA.  Otherwise, the general rule is that the 
tax losses, if any, would be captured inside in the Enron Canada entity and 
would not be available to be used against Enron Canada's taxable income.

5. With respect to Project Stanley, there is really no established case 
authority directly on point, but the better view is that any sanction, if and 
when imposed on Enron Canada, would be imposed in a way that would prevent 
Enron Canada from indirectly avoiding the application of the sanction, such 
as by moving certain business operations into a special purpose entity.  In 
other words, if Canada or Alberta were intent on suspending or affecting 
Enron Canada's abilities to transact through the PPAs or otherwise in the 
Alberta Power Pool, it is likely that the sanction would be imposed upon 
Enron Canada and its affiliated entities also transacting through the Power 
Pool.

Based upon the preliminary answers, please let me know if you want a more 
detailed legal opinion to consider these issues further and whether Hemstock 
and I should be approaching the Government to qualify a special purpose 
entity.

Regards, Peter

Agribusiness Consultant role.  Mark will be on contract for a 6 month period 
and may be brought on full time pending his success.  His rate of pay is 
equivalent to $80k annually.  If  Enron breaks the contract within three 
months Mark will be paid a breakage fee of 20k.  If contract is broken after 
three months Mark will be paid the amount remaining under his agreement.   If 
Mark is hired full time during this contract there will be no associated fee 
involved.

Call me on Beau.  A couple thoughts.

If they are so screwed why can't we get a couple million in fees.

Also, remember that the Canadian commericial group wears the debt not the 
credit group.

The Zufferli stuff seems like it is getting a little confused in Canada.  
They might need to change his Contract to Canadian language but none of the 
terms should change including the end date except for his agreed upon 
Canadian $ pay.

This stuff looks good.

Why don't you combine all your stuff, maybe include the org chart also and 
see if we can get a 3 or 4 page report.  Send it to me and I'll run if by 
Dave.

Following up on our summit.  I wrote down that you would follow up on the 
synergies or lack there of between the research group and the group run by 
Scott Tholen.   I would be happy to coordinate this myself.  Please write 
back and let me know if this is okay.

Can you tell me how many Enron entities are members of the AGA (American Gas 
Association).  The fee is 100K and I think HPL is a member and not us.  But I 
wonder if some of our other piplelines are members.

In the past couple weeks, Janelle Scheuer has been contacted about a couple 
job opportunities. Initially by someone on the crude desk offering her a job 
to head
their marketing group. Jeff Shankman followed up to encourage her to become a 
candidate for the job. Separately, Fred LaGrasta approached Janelle to ask if
she would be interested in coming back to work for him in Breslau's 
Industrial Group. 

My concern is  that none of these individuals provided me the courtesy to 
check if it would be appropriate to discuss job opportunities with Janelle. 
Given that she has been in power for only  5 months and is performing a 
critical role in our effort to increase deal flow, I will be in a bind if I 
loose her. Janelle did the right thing by divulging this information. I 
wanted you to be aware of this.

Thanks,   Ed

I wouldn't mind waiting a few weeks to go to Portland.  PRC is going to eat 
up a lot of time in the next few weeks and it would be nice if Mike Swerzman 
was in town when we went.  However, whatever you want "I will follow"(U2).

In the future, if you have a message regarding John Lavorato's schedule, 
could you please send it to me instead of sending it to John.  

Also, you did not provide the time, however, Kay Chapman indicated that the 
meeting will take place at 2:00 p.m.  John is not available at 2:00 p.m.

Thank you

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    "Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. "This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice." Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    "We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,"
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. "We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance."
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to
the province 10 years after the market opens.
    British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive
process over the last two years. They have significant operating experience
and a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.
    To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licences
from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario Energy
Board. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing and
operating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy Control
Board.
    Ontario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generating
company. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity to
consumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to be
a premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generation
and wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open and
environmentally responsible manner.
    British Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. British
Energy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the United
States through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be a
worldwide electricity leader building on its "Safety First" culture and track
record of commercial success.

Can we put something into our trading system where it would stop us from 
entering a counterparty in if we were full on credit.  This could help the 
communication problem that currently exists on companies like Perry Gas.  
Please advise.

Kyle is working on the PPA.  However, Dave and I told Kyle that unless he can 
get Fastow to sign something that we can walk on the counterparty (in 
otherwords that it is truly non recourse) we are not interested.  

Let me know if we are missing something.

Can you type up thank you letters for me.


Dear xxxx

I would like to thank you for your generous donation to The Order of Good 
Cheer fundraising effort.  Our organization raised over $200,000 for the 
Enviros Program.  The money was much needed and will allow this wonderful 
program to continue to improve the lives of young Calgarians who have 
experienced hardship.

Yours Truly





John Lavorato.

I thought I would give you an update on what I am doing from a systems 
perspective.  I'm trying to get a systems plan together from Beth.  We simple 
do not have one.  From there I will coordinate with traders and back office 
to try to create a plan that everyone can by off on.  My new motto is 
"Systems will be fixed or people will die".  I will keep you informed.

John

Now that we sent the first blow, lets get everyone together to discuss our

Also, did Blakes definately drop us on this file or have they reconsidered.

Subject: Initial Thoughts On Alberta

As a result of meetings in Calgary last week, I have come up with the 
following capabilities that we need to develop in Calgary to effectively 
trade, schedule, and settle in that market.  I envision a series of 
transition teams, organized by function, that are responsible for 
transferring systems, knowledge, and people from the east and west power 
desks up to the Calgary office.  These are my initial thoughts.  Things will 
obviously change as we learn more about the market rules and when we get the 
head of the desk in place.

Trading
Transition team - Tim Belden, Mike Swerzbin, Bill Greenizen
Hire head trader.  John L. and Tim are currently working with John Zufferli 
to guage interest and come to terms on relocation.  John Z. is planning a 
trip to Portland and Calgary as soon as he is able to fly.  Hopefully the 
week of September 16th.
Get EOL products defined and posted.  Greenizen hopes to get this done by 
September 16th.
Develop curves.  Currently using implied PPA bid curves.
Develop position reports.
Give offers to origination team.  Tim/Mike/Bill will provide prices to 
origination until head trader has been hired.

Risk
Transition team - Monica Lande and Kathy ??
Kathy traveled to Portland on 9/5 and 9/6 to learn about our risk process and 
book deals.
Book positions.  In process of entering five deals.  One for each unit, line 
losses for each unit, and payment for the PPA.  Will run mini book to ensure 
that close to zero value is created when all deals are booked and run against 
our curves.  Should have this done by September 8th.
Drop curves.
Create position reports.

Scheduling
Transition team - Jeff Richter, Bill Greenizen, Peggy H.
Learn and define scheduling requirements in Alberta.
Learn about California scheduling systems.
Assess applicability of California scheduling systems to Alberta market.
Hire a scheduler.

Real Time
Transition team - John Forney
Assess whether we need to run real time group in Calgary.  We may be able to 
start with someone on days and have nights and weekends covered from 
Portland.  Legal issues with Portland providing service to Calgary.
Assuming we want a real time person in Calgary ... hire a RT trader/analyst.  
We may be able to draw from Portland's real time desk for this.

Fundamentals
Transition team - Tim Heizenrader and Stephan ??, and Chris Wiebe
We can use the Portland fundamentals team to do much of the work before 
January.  We have the systems and most likely the staff to come up with the 
first generation of Alberta fundamentals.
Train a person who will eventually be located in Calgary on West Power 
Fundamentals -- systems and processes.  Stephan or Chris W. may fit this 
bill.  Must get buy in from Heizenrader and head trader.
We have a person in Houston, Sanjeev Khanna, who used to work for Enmax and 
now works for structuring in Houston.  He is not interested in relocating to 
Calgary, but would like to help us learn about the market.
Should consider trying to hire industry expertise from local utility.  Derek 
will work on this.  Sanjeev may have some ideas here.
Establish better network connections between Portland and Calgary.  Dan 
Dietrich.

Volume Management
Transition team - Murray O'Neil, Peggy H., Laura Scott
Learn market rules for settlements.  Get 1 person from Derek's group to try 
to spell out the settlements formulas on both the pool side and the contract 
side.
Compare Alberta Power Pool settlements procedures to California settlements 
and determine whether Volume Management system will do the job.
Come up with a manual backup plan until VM system will work.
Hire someone to do volume management in Calgary.  We are currently assessing 
whether anyone from Portland could do this job.


I will be out of the office until September 16th.  We have already made plans 
for Bill G, Kathy, Peggy, and Laura to come to Portland to check out our 
systems and processes.  Shortly after I return we should be able to nail down 
the head trader position.  Tim Heizenrader will call Sanjeev to see if there 
is a role for him to play in our Fundamental Analysis effort.  It may be 
worth waiting until the head trader is in place to do this.

I'm off to Montana for a week.  Debra Davidson will be able to get in touch 
with me.  She can be reached at 503-464-3820.

Regards,
Tim

We have just completed a one week transfer of trading and e-commerce 
knowledge and experiences with both Houston and London. This had been done to 
better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the 
results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem 
appropriate for our activities.

The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial 
depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The 
advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult 
to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different 
states of development and application of business strategies.

The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is 
obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of 
evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that 
the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK 
market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these 
similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent 
of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business 
experience and corresponding strategy.

I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and 
foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our 
business.  

MFG

P.S.  

At the end of the term of each simulation do we assume that we close the 
position on that date and take a hit or do we leave the simulation with an 
open positon.

I have asked the crude group to give a presentation on fuel oil supply and 
demand which will take place Wednesday July 12 at 2:15 in the big boardroom 
on the 30th floor. I would encourage everyone to come and bring any traders 
that you think would benefit from it.

that we get pummled and left for dead.  I'll let you know.

As you know we were trying to do some funding deals prior to the end of the 
year.  We executed a total of $65 Million CAD with 4 different companies (TD, 
CIBC, Bank Paribas, and BMO).  Everyone who I cc'd this note to did a great 
job of helping us execute.

I agree.  If we ultimately trade out of Toronto, the P/L responsibility will 
probably role into you.  It looks like we were trying to close Garret Tripp 
(Associate) to move to Toronto and start looking at this stuff.  If he is 
going, you should meet with him before he goes.

Chris,

We will not be able to publish a preliminary DPR or position report for 
10/31.  Port Calc has suffered a serious code crash, and the numbers 
generated are erroneous.  Our IT support will be working through the night to 
repair the code (Zhiyong's group), and hopefully by tomorrow morning we will 
be able to rerun an official book.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to call.

Thanks,

Mike,

Tonight John and I are going to be migrated to Outlook.  Please note that 
John has a laptop computer that is at his home.  I have spoken with Randy 
about this and he is to be following up with you.  I would like for you to 
accompany Greg out to the Lavorato home to complete the migration on to his 
computer.

Also, please note that I gave my and John's passwords to a lady that stopped 
by my desk today (she is with the migration group).  Could you please confirm 
for me tomorrow that they have been shreaded.

Thanks

As many of you already know, we have officially embarked on building a 
commercial credit trading business based in Europe but globally focused with 
trading operations in London and Houston.  We are focused on externally 
launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy 
credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we 
expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very 
quickly.  The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit 
department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently 
distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review 
prior to going live.  The intent is to capture as much of the corporate 
credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal 
resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new 
mediums for communication.    To this extent, any ideas that you might have 
for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know.  

This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading 
initiatives.  We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop 
as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on 
ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and 
customer base.

I am with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and am trying to find out 
more information on market and financial risk management devices.  Enron 
appears to have one of the largest varieties of measures and is extremely 
well respected in this field.

Can you provide some information about the Market & Financial Risk Management 
products that you provide for the US Natural Gas Industry.  I am looking for 
pricing information  as well as availability.  Information pertaining to the 
Northwest would be greatly appreciated.  For example cost of a natural gas 
future (range of premiums)  Cost of weather insurance based on what measure? 

If you do not have that kind of information but can point me in the right 
direction it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your assistance,

Subject: Re: New Associates  

In the fundamentals group under Hunter, there is also research going on 
regarding LNG, and distillates, (and gas, weather, etc).  Vikas' background 
is in crude and products, and worked at Aquiva with two of Lagrasta's 
marketers.  I agreed to take him (6 months ago) and was planning for him to 
research crude/products.  Celeste Roberts knows the conversations we had with 
Vikas in particular becuase he wanted to start meeting people in my group and 
originally did not come through the associate program, where we finally put 
him, and she was involved from the beginning.  Li Sun is a Wharton MBA that 
Lavo did not originally pick when he went through the list with you, and was 
slated to go elsewhere.    I picked her up, after that, and she too is 
someone about whom Celeste and I had many conversations. I had met her last 
summer, and at Wharton recruiting events.  Prior to John's coming down 
Celeste and I had agreed she could come into my organization (gas) to do 
research, or to work with Vince--she is an unbelievable modeler.  I have no 
idea who the other two are or where they are going, and have not met either 
of them.  

I suspect now that we have delineated recruiting and staffing, which occurred 
recently, we won't have this confusion among the associate program 
administrators again.  

Not trying to kill you,

Jeff

Jeff, you are killing me - we targeted that group specifically to build the 
risk business in gas and east power in the short run.  This was well planned 
effort.

Dave and John, I spoke to Jeff Shenkman and he has indicated that the 
following new associates are to support him in his role in Global Markets:

Dustin Collins
Vikas Dwivedi
Li Sun

Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are 
identified in our system.

John after speaking with you, it is clear that you have not been in contact 
with Jeff regarding these associates supporting him.

Dave, can we discuss this matter?  I can be reached at 713/853-7351.  My 
pager # is 1-800-980-1665.  Thanks.

John,

Hunter Shively needs Doyle Baughman to monitor the construction of a pipeline 
in the U.S.  Doyle has done this for us in the past.

The terms of the agreement are as follows:

1st month $10,000 + expenses
2nd+ months $  9,000 + expenses

Hunter anticipates that we will use Doyle for several months.  We can 
terminate our agreement at anytime.

Regards,
Brad

Hello again everyone.  One last structure pre-christmas.  I'm am working on 
an option structure with TD bank that would see 20,000,000 CAD go out the 
door on Wednesday December 22nd or Thursday December 23rd.  There will be no 
special documentation necessary, only standard option confirmations.  The 
money will return equally over the 12 months of 2000.  TD is charging us a 
fee of 50K CAD for the idea but since it is different than the deals we have 
already done I'm OK with it.  What I need is the following.

1 -  If there are any questions or concerns please call me early Monday 
morning.

2 - Jordon - Please call me and give me your OK.

3.  Juanita - Let me know if you can handle the payment in time.

4.  Joe - How's are Line of Credit coming - we're running out of time.

Thanks 

John Lavorato

Ignore expenses.  We just split the whole office in half to split the trading 
and marketing.  You are also not authorized to see some of those expenses.  
So please ignore them.

Same a mid year

I'm smarter than everyone else.

Just in Case

*  Managed a Trading group that is up 2 Billion (more if you included hits 
taken) - probably not due to me.
*  Left a lot of money in Canada - some is still there.
*  Led the PPA deal - which I will resign and buy personally if you want to 
turn it back.
*  Created the Gas Fundamentals Group which every business unit is copying.
* Came up with LTP which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in 
the future and every company is copying.
*  Trained many great young kids in Calgary that are now key players in 
Houston.
*  Created structure and communication around our system strategy - brought 
traders, IT, and back office together to create a plan that everyone has 
bought into.  The future success is unclear but the exercise was very 
worthwhile.
*  Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and 
reporting of VAR.  Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and 
the risk group.
*  Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the 
continuation of the increase in Gas.
*  Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank 
that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion.
*  Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours 
devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.  You will see this 
implemented in 2001.
*  Experimented with the "Pay PRC"  which I think was very successful.  I 
think this will start our organization to think a little differently and 
hopefully in a way that will benefit us.
*  Possibly the best accomplishment is "Killing the Dragon".

I'm glad you made me write this list down because for the first time in 
months I realized that I was smiling while I was writing.

Regards

John

I have been requesting that the Canadian gas reports be broken down by trader 
for a while.  I am not comfortable not knowing the P/L or positions by trader 
in Canada.  Why is this not done yet and how can I help get it done.

Subject: TDC Energy

I need to make you aware of a potential lawsuit we may be filing jointly with 
Columbia Energy Services/Nisource against TDC Energy regarding a CES 
transaction.  I don't have every detail yet, but I wanted to fill you in 
because this is moving quite quickly.

TDC Energy is a small privately owned producer that had several deals with 
CES that ENA acquired in last year's transaction.  Four of those transactions 
were costless collars that are deep in the money for us.  TDC is disputing 
the existence of these collars because CES never sent confirmations for 
them.   We have taken the position with CES that if TDC defaults it is CES' 
exposure, not ENA's.  The total value of these collars as of today is 
approximately $4,800,000.   I have been working with Jeff Hodge on this issue 
and we believe that, because of several different reasons, ENA should file 
the lawsuit with TDC jointly.  I'll be happy to meet with you if you're 
interested and explain the reasons for this.

In addition, ENA has other deep in the money fixed priced transactions with 
TDC worth an estimated $5,000,000 (unofficially from R. Diamond in Credit)   
TDC has not disputed these transactions and so far all is fine with these; 
however, we fear that TDC may be facing financial difficulties--if they go 
bankrupt, we have exposure on the $5,000,000 of fixed price transactions, 
plus potentially all or part of the other $4,800,000 of financial collars.  
Jeff Hodge is meeting today with CES' outside attorneys to discuss where we 
should file the lawsuit and I get the impression that it is already drafted 
and will be filed very soon.  Please let me know if you want to talk through 
this.

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    "Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. "This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice." Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    "We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,"
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. "We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance."
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to

I talked to Whalley about it a little bit.  The one issue is that when we 
liquidate a bad position they get out first.  Think about it.

1.  I didn't know much about ag products but Ted Murphy is trying to include 
me in the loop.

2. Chris Calger says that he has aggregated his CPI positions for the west.  
Can check if Dave Duran has done this for the east and try to aggregate the 
position.  If you need help let me know.

I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list 
of agreed apon tasks.

1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we 
have huge business risk if it blows up. 

 -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to 
maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  
        (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds 
like it should be a high priority)

2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to 
long hours on the part of our back office staff.  

 -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to 
address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are 
expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add 
hardware and reduce the time problems.

3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately 
combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real 
time risk.
TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the 
traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by 
the               traders to meet their needs. 

 -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in 
consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to 
come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.

4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is 
leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made 
progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the 
next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.

5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin 
Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements 
deals and volume management deals in the east.

6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).

7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their 
books through an interface with Houston.  

 -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its 
worthwile to put servers in Portland.    

 -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering 
all his needs.

I think it's time to review our disaster plan with respect to trading as we 
enter hurrincane season.  As I understand, there is no real cohesive plan, or 
course of action.  We could think about the Chicago office as an evacuation 
site for redundant trading, etc. This issue affects all businesses, and Sally 
and I have been talking about this problem.  John, should I get in touch with 
Phillippe or do anything else?

Subject: EES Pre-holiday Update

Regulatory:

Based on the on-going CA PUC hearings and opinions of Enron legal and 
regulatory groups, it seems that the Commission is likely to increase tariff 
rates by anywhere from 10 to 20% (PG&E and SCE are arguing for a 30% increase 
- not realistic). The critical decision is to leave EES direct-access 
customers on that tariff. Alternatively, if the PUC rules to end the rate 
freeze, eliminates the existing CTC credits and does not allow EES customers 
to switch to this tariff, we stand to lose somewhere between $600-650 
million, as EES would have to serve their customer loads by buying expensive 
CA power during 2001.

A 10% increase in tariff rates results in ~$50 million loss for EES. However, 
if the tariff is extended beyond 2001, it will create additional value for 
EES (the tariff is lower than Cal-02 power prices). 

CA Gov. Davis met with Clinton yesterday where they have decided to extend 
the emergency status in the state.

Ken Lay is scheduled to meet with Davis today to address the following topics:
 - clarify any inaccurate information about Enron's role in CA markets
 - urge the Governor to not go overboard with this situation and give the 
"world" to the CA utilities
 - remind about the upside PG&E and SCE will realize from high valuations of 
hydro plants (increased almost three-fold from a year ago)

Hearings and oral arguments will continue this week. CA PUC decision is 
expected to come on Jan-4th, followed by multiple appeals.

Credit issues:

 - Enron is attempting to reduce credit exposure with PG&E, whereby PG&E will 
assign its out-of-the-money trades with Avista and MS to EPMI and    EES will 
assign its in-the-money positions with PG&E to EPMI, creating an off-set. 
These assignments will reduce PG&E exposure by ~$265 MM,    in exchange for 
Avista and MS exposures.
 - PUC is not likely to rule removal of retail tariff retroactively (to May 
99) - this will enforce EES position in collecting its accounts receivable 
from    PG&E of ~$150 MM (so far, they have not paid Enron on the premise of 
retroactive ruling).

Market Risk:

12/27 VaR is $7.8 MM - limit violation. An increase of $0.5 MM because of:
 - addition of long Feb-01 positions at MidC
 - overall increase in prices
 - incorrectly booked trades at PJM (50 MWs Cal-03 Long instead of a Short)

My suggestion, at a high level, to Don Black and Dennis Benevides to sell MWs 
in both East and West in order to reduce VaR. However, because of the 
holidays the liquidity in the market is very scarce.

Vlady.

I do not run EES trading.  I would contact Marty Sunde with respect to big 
costs that EES wants to spend.  Marty runs EES North America.  I agree with 
you however that they should't go crazy on spending.

Subject: Friday Meeting on Dayrates

Just as a reminder to everyone, there is a meeting in John Lavorato's office 
this Friday June 2nd regarding Dayrates

John

Enclosed is the presentation that Keith MacIvor and I gave to Noble 
Drilling's CEO, Jim Day and Pride International's CEO, Paul Bragg, their CFO, 
Earl McNiel, and their COO, James Allen this morning 5/30.  Both sets of 
leaders were extremely interested in pursuing dayrate transactions with us.  
Both sets said that they believed this product would have a very positive 
impact of the drilling business.

Jim Day assigned us to his leading financial innovators, Mark May and Steve 
Manz.  Paul Bragg and Earl McNiel are wanting to sign an ISDA asap and begin 
discussions asap.

 I will be giving the same presentation to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, Jim 
Tisch this Thursday (in New York) and a "deal specific" presentation to the 
CFO of Chiles Offshore the same day.

It sounds like I need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of 
power in Ontario.  

1.  Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to 
understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including 
building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the 
Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the 
Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for 
Ontario.  

2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto 
office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could 
always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.

3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have 
no power trading responsibilities.

4.  Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.  I expect us to use 
Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there, 
however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.

5.  Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know 
the people and the technical resources available to him.

If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.

John

I would like to request a temporary increase of the Natural Gas var limit for 
the next 10 business days.  I suggest Natural Gas Trading's limit increase to 
45 Million limit from the current 40 Million limit.  The floor is very 
bullish and we don't want to take off our West Basis positions which are 
eating up a lot of var.

Although we are a qualified bidder, we still have not made the decision to 
bid.  I would try to avoid discussing but if you need to give me a call.

John, I think they have to do something to improve the customize pages.  At a 
minimum, they need to build something so you don't have to re add day gas 
everyday.

I wanted to thank you guys for all your support over the last painful week.  
Although I am definately not getting brave, I would like to request an extra 
15 Million for gas for the next week.  The price levels are making it hard to 
eliminate risk.  I can give you my assurance that any increase in VAR day to 
day will come from price movement, not increase in position.  

Let me know

I think we are making great progress on the systems side.  I would like to 
set a deadline of November 10th to have a plan on all North American projects 
(I'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by 
commercial, Sally's world, and Beth's world.  When I say signed off I mean 
that I want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the 
plan for each project.  If you don't agree don't sign. If certain projects 
(ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan 
will be complete.  I want much more in the way of specifics about objectives 
and timeframe.

Thanks for everyone's hard work on this.

John

In the fundamentals group under Hunter, there is also research going on 
regarding LNG, and distillates, (and gas, weather, etc).  Vikas' background 
is in crude and products, and worked at Aquiva with two of Lagrasta's 
marketers.  I agreed to take him (6 months ago) and was planning for him to 
research crude/products.  Celeste Roberts knows the conversations we had with 
Vikas in particular becuase he wanted to start meeting people in my group and 
originally did not come through the associate program, where we finally put 
him, and she was involved from the beginning.  Li Sun is a Wharton MBA that 
Lavo did not originally pick when he went through the list with you, and was 
slated to go elsewhere.    I picked her up, after that, and she too is 
someone about whom Celeste and I had many conversations. I had met her last 
summer, and at Wharton recruiting events.  Prior to John's coming down 
Celeste and I had agreed she could come into my organization (gas) to do 
research, or to work with Vince--she is an unbelievable modeler.  I have no 
idea who the other two are or where they are going, and have not met either 
of them.  

I suspect now that we have delineated recruiting and staffing, which occurred 
recently, we won't have this confusion among the associate program 
administrators again.  

Not trying to kill you,

Jeff

following new associates are to support him in his role in Global Markets:

Dustin Collins
Vikas Dwivedi
Li Sun

Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are

John after speaking with you, it is clear that you have not been in contact 
with Jeff regarding these associates supporting him.

Dave, can we discuss this matter?  I can be reached at 713/853-7351.  My

01/22 12:52 UPDATE 1-Enron distances itself from Calif. power crisis 

HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Energy powerhouse Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday 
distanced itself from California's power crisis, saying the turmoil which has 
brought the state's two largest utilities to the brink of bankruptcy would 
not impact its bottom line. 

"We do not expect the California situation to have any significant effect on 
Enron's financial outlook, specifically our ability to hit 2001 targets," 
Jeff Skilling, the president and chief operating officer of North America's 
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas, said in a conference 
call with analysts. 
Skilling also said there hadn't been any significant impact on fourth quarter 
earnings, noting that Enron did not own electricity generation assets in 
California, where rolling electricity blackouts were imposed last week and 
the state's top two utilities are running out of money as they face soaring 
wholesale electricity costs. 

Having sold electricity to the state's main utilities, generating companies 
such as Reliant Energy Inc. <REI.N> and Dynegy Corp. <DYN.N> are now at risk 
of not receiving payments from Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp. 
<PCG.N>, and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International 
<EIX.N>. 

At the same time, some have claimed that power generators have taken 
advantage of the crisis by over-charging the state's utilities, which, as 
part of deregulation, cannot pass on skyrocketing electricity prices to 
consumers. 

"California is a much smaller percentage of our overall earnings than some of 
the other energy companies, particularly generators," Skilling said, adding 
that the company only participates in the merchant business of buying and 
selling electricity. 

"The bottom line is this: We are not overexposed in California or anywhere 
else for that matter." 
Shares of Enron rose $2-3/8 to $73-7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange after 
it reported earnings before nonrecurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 
million in the fourth quarter.

I agree with all your points.  There had to be a first time.  
I've been blowing Ted off because of the markets last week.
Let's get together this week with Ted and discuss the future.

Kim please set up meeting with Ox and Bland and me.

Hello Guys-

As of a year and a half ago, Enron cancelled their membership to the AGA.  
This has not presented a problem since we still have acess to the online 
database as long as we are the reporting entity for the Bammel storage 
facility.  One thing to keep in mind is that when we sell HPL, we will need 
to subscribe to the AGA at a cost of about $100,000 per year in order to keep 
the online access which is critical for the weekly AGA stoage numbers.  
(Bloomberg reports the same numbers 2 minutes later, and per the traders 
those are VERY critical seconds).

Regards,

Julie  :-)

Barry,

FYI the California QF's are negotiating a settlement deal with Edison and the 
state of California which would fix energy payments over five years.  
Currently the energy payments are indexed to Socal Border because a majority 
of the Edison QF's buy spot gas.  If this settlement happens, the QF's will 
likely want to buy financial swaps.  The Edison gas-fired QF's represent 
about 500MMCF/Day of gas.

I have not seen her resume. 

Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.

Hunter spoke with Li today and agrees that her first rotation should be in

Vikas, will do very well in Hunter's group.

The model looks great except when I changed an input and hit go it blew up.  
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  One thing that I would like changed is that 
I want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last 
day.  So the role should happen on the second last day not the last day.  
Please change that if you can.

I would like to request an extension of the 45 million limit until Friday.  
We like gas and we would like to maximize this move.

The attached spreadsheet outlines the remaining income (assuming no further 
recovery) to be recorded on Blue Range.  There is an issue regarding the 
foreign exchange on the Houston reserve as detailed on this spreadsheet.  
Canada's position is that this is a Canadian dollar denominated transaction 
and we should be kept whole on the Canadian dollars.  Please review, Wanda, 
and let me know if you have any questions.

John -

Again,  we are having "big time" systems issues.  While we are having the 
usual length of time issues (a few people were here past midnight last 
night), the issues that occured last night are much more serious than in the 
past.  The system brought through totally inaccurate information on a few 
books.  (Positions,  value,  etc.)  Luckily, these errors were all caught 
last night,  but if a less experienced person had been on those books,  it 
could have been a disaster.  (Traders getting incorrect positions and p&l and 
interest rate and credit getting incorrect numbers.)  I have contacted those 
in ERMS that need to be involved,  but I would appreciate it if you could 
provide additional support to this effort.

Thanks,

Jeff

Regarding: positions in natural gas trading

Dear Mr. Shankman:

I  am  writing to inquire about positions in natural gas trading with Enron
North  America.   I  have been working with EOTT Energy Corporation for the
last  four  months on a temporary basis on a project involving setting up a
profit/loss  report  for  the  various regions within the United States for
EOTT's  crude  oil trading and marketing business.  Previously, I worked in
the  energy  industry  for  over  two  years  in  trading, risk management,
structured  products  and  marketing of electricity and natural gas for the
western  United  States.   Additionally,  I  was  actively  involved in the
physical  markets  and  gained  a strong understanding of the western grid.
Furthermore,  I am an expert in options trading and have a strong knowledge
of the commodity and financial markets.  Moreover, I have also traded NYMEX
natural  gas  futures,  options  on futures, forward contracts for physical
power  and  options  in  SERC, SPP, MAAC, MAIN, ECAR and ERCOT.  Finally, I
have  had  experience  setting  up/operating  market  simulation models and
maintaining the underlying databases for fixed income securities.  Prior to
entering the energy markets, I worked as the senior trader/risk manager for
Mellon  Mortgage  Company  in  Houston,  Texas.   At  Mellon,  I positively
affected  the  bottom  line  performance  of the company for over two years
through  strategic  trading  and  hedging of mortgage backed securities.  I
received the Premier Achievement Award from the Chief Executive Officer for
outstanding  financial  performance  and  the  Employee  Choice  Award from
co-workers for my tenacity and diligence in work.  My expertise with listed
futures  and  options  on  futures,  OTC  options and swaps, as well as the
ability  to  positively  affect  the  bottom  line could definitely make an
impact  with  your  team.   In addition, my competitive and entrepreneurial
personality  allows  me to constantly look for profitable solutions or cost
effective ways of managing risk.

As  you  will  note  from  the  enclosed  resume, I managed the trading and
hedging  of  the  interest  rate risk on mortgage loans for Mellon Mortgage
Company.   The  interest  rate risk was managed by use of forward sales and
purchases  of  mortgage backed securities, put and call options on mortgage
backed securities, and 10 year CMT Index floors.  In addition,  futures and
options on futures on U.S. Government Treasury notes and bonds were used at
the  appropriate  time  taking into account the basis between mortgages and
treasuries.   Previously,   I worked for The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
in  New York as a proprietary trader in fixed income. Earlier, I worked for
Garvin  Guybutler  Corporation,  a  major  international  money and deposit
broker.    Primary  responsibilities  at  Garvin  included  uncovering  and
executing  arbitrage EuroDeposit transactions in order to enhance placement
yields   and   reduce   borrowing  costs  relative  to  Eurodollar  deposit
transactions  of  similar  maturities.   In addition, I was involved in the
brokering   of   Term  Federal  Funds,  EuroDollar  deposits,  EuroCurrency
deposits, Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Rate Agreements.

It  would be my pleasure to discuss these qualifications with you and learn
more  about  positions  in  natural  gas  trading with Enron North America.
Please contact me so we can talk about possible opportunities.

Thank you,

Emmisions Trading will go from Kevin Presto  (Greg Wolfe) to George McClellan 
under the following  conditions.

1 -  Volumes will not fall.  In fact they will increase.

2 - Wolfe will retain 1 Million of the 3 Million VAR for six months and then 
East Power will have no Emmisions Positions,

3 -  Janel Guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal.

4 - East Power and Coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer 
pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that Greg is not 
keeping.

Give me a call if there are any issues.

John,

As of Wednesday, we have a resource from Sun Microsystems that is helping  us 
isolate the problems we're having with the UNIX operating system and our 
code.  This resource has requested that we bring on an additional application 
specialist from SUN.  This has been authorized and the additional resource is 
scheduled to be on site next week.  I also have my resources and the UNIX 
administrators working along side the Sun resources.

As an aside, we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side 
of the business.  I met with Sally Beck's controllers yesterday and we are 
putting a plan in place.  The increased trading volumes have seriously 
impacted our through put and we now have a 'blitz' on to correct the issues.

These problems have not gone unnoticed.  I assure you that IT has been very 
diligent in following through on these problems.  We're investing heavily in 
additional hardware, bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources 
at an average of 5 - 8 per week.  I will keep you posted as we continue to 
enhance our existing systems.

Beth

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

Guys,
This Enpower calc issue is a joke.   How can we be the most Innovative 
Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.  
Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our 
power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, 
settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.

In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because 
they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on "holidays".  This 
whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt 
with accordingly.

Please advise.  Thank you.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the 
power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

Subject: athena vs quark

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our 
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power 
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

Subject: Memo re Ontario/Alberta power markets

John, attached is a brief memo for you to pass on to J. Sutton.  It address 
both Ontario and Alberta.  My understanding is that the two people that Mr. 
Sutton is meeting next Wednesday at the Canadian Embassy  are Jim Wilson 
(Ontario Minister of Energy) and Tony Clement (Ontario Minister of the 
Environment , also Minister of Municipal Affairs).  Accordingly, I suspect 
that the  part on Ontario will be most relevant for Mr. Sutton's purposes.  
It occurs to me that Mr. Sutton might want: a) a brief profile of each of 
Wilson and Clement  (i.e there is some personal data that he may find of 
interest for conversation purposes - i.e. Wilson is very proud of the fact 
that his great- uncle, Father Jim Wilson, founded Little League baseball in 
Houston); and b) a memo setting out some key messages which Mr. Sutton might 
deliver regarding the Ontario market.  Let me know and I can get that stuff 
to you on Monday to forward on.

We have finalized our P&L for Q3.  On the last day of the quarter we had 
about a half dozen deals that were closed that credit still had not given us 
a number for.  We were hit with credit reserves for three deals on the last 
day of the quarter.  These deals were done more than a month ago and credit 
materially changed some of the reserve numbers at the last minute.  We still 
have not received credit numbers from three deals that were done in Q3.  What 
level of service should I expect from credit?

The P&L is not yet done for yesterday.  Our risk group was here until 
midnight.  Our systems were not working right.

		 Subject: EOL/ Hedge Funds

Most of the macro hedge funds want to trade global crude products and gas 
options immediately.  However,  I am having a big problem getting Tudor and 
like funds up and running on EOL-

Problems:
#1: Credit- major back-log on new names - we don't have enough resources to 
deal with these names (the structures of the funds can be complex- not like 
dealing with industrials).  
#2: With those that we have docs, credit has said we can not trade on-line. 
(???)

The only differences I see with funds trading online is that their trades 
need to go to credit's (Bill Bradford's group) to be included in daily MTM 
and 5 day VAR reports.  We calculate variation margin off these reports so 
its essential credit gets the trades...

AND

In the case of Tudor, they allocate trades between funds- the EOL trades 
would need to go to me or the backoffice, so we could allocate them.

I think the EOL reporting issues can easily be resolved- the credit back log 
is the real killer at the moment.

Rgds,
Caroline

Subject: Memo re Ontario/Alberta power markets

John, attached is a brief memo for you to pass on to J. Sutton.  It address 
both Ontario and Alberta.  My understanding is that the two people that Mr. 
Sutton is meeting next Wednesday at the Canadian Embassy  are Jim Wilson 
(Ontario Minister of Energy) and Tony Clement (Ontario Minister of the 
Environment , also Minister of Municipal Affairs).  Accordingly, I suspect 
that the  part on Ontario will be most relevant for Mr. Sutton's purposes.  
It occurs to me that Mr. Sutton might want: a) a brief profile of each of 
Wilson and Clement  (i.e there is some personal data that he may find of 
interest for conversation purposes - i.e. Wilson is very proud of the fact 
that his great- uncle, Father Jim Wilson, founded Little League baseball in 
Houston); and b) a memo setting out some key messages which Mr. Sutton might 
deliver regarding the Ontario market.  Let me know and I can get that stuff 
to you on Monday to forward on.

Subject: EnronCredit Move

John, I need your help again.  Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting 
to move to level 14.  There are several problems with this move.


1.  This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to 
support them.
 a.  The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk).
 b.  Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more 
cabling for the turrets.
  There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling
 c.  AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer 
manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.
  The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in 
late December.
  Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 2001.

2.  This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems.
 a.  Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.

3.  The Response Time would be affected.
 a.  The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA 
trading floors.
  A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, 
Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.
  Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs 
for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group.
 b.  We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on 
Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.
  The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.

4.  There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be 
susceptible to power outages.


I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to 
move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.  Level 29 has been 
completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is 
also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.  This floor has been built out with 
Trading Desk furniture as well.

My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; 
this will save the company both money and time.  Your help is needed to 
convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.

Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Darren Adamik

Jim

This information on Ontario nukes is similar to our information. The only 
difference is that our regulatory lawyer feels that only one of the four 
Pickering units (500 mw each) would come back in 2001 (although optimistic) 
followed by one each year after that.  Your report says that all Pickering 
units would come back in 2001.  Even in your report, however, they seem 
doubtful that this is realistic.  The Bruce Units (3000 mw) appear to be dead 
for a long time if not for good.

Regards,  John

P.S.  I'll call you soon on are project, currently on hold until 2001 if we 
decide to build in Ontario.

A funny story:
Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of 
unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the 
exchange stopped trading for an hour.  
Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything 
was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange 
closing.  One yelled at Rappaport...

Wow I don't think so.   I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of 
the factual errors.  If you disagree please write me back.

I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named 
President of the Canadian operation.  We went from a small gas marketing shop 
to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.  It was 
absolutely awesome.  I had the time of my life.  We built the business with 
very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's 
bottom line.  These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading 
and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create 
liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.  
So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help 
build revolutionary new businesses.

What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk 
management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.  The opportunities our 
outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  These 
businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different 
variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage 
in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.  You can't 
put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other 
commodities.  Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to 
figure out what the Fed is going to do.  It has much more complexity, and if 
you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down 
here! .... we need you!

John's callout quote

Enron's not a place where you can hide.  If you can't get it done you won't 
fit in.  But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll 
excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.

Subject: Power Hedges in Accrual Book

Stacy White informed me this morning there is discussions on moving all of 
the Power Hedges from the accrual book (approx $100 million loss) into the 
MTM books.  Is this true?

Do I need to be in the loop?

FYI - We successfully bought out of the 2001 supply commitment to OPPD at our 
mark ($4.7 million).  This leaves us with 3 customer deals that I would like 
to set aside as prudency C for East Power (not West Power or gas) for 
calender year 2001.   The 3 deals are MJMUC, VEPCO, and JEA.

Thanks.

Subject: Global Risk Management

On Friday, May 5, 2000 , Rick Buy and Jeff Skillling signed a memo 
designating John Lavorato (Western Hemishere) and John Sherriff (Eastern 
Hemisphere)
as the responsible parties for signing the Daily Positiion Report.  Please 
obtain Greg Whalley's approval for all DPR's prior to that date.  Going 
forward, please coordinate with each as to their preferred method of 
designating approval.  I assume you will use e-mail until such time that the 
Executive Reports Viewer can be changed to accomodate this change.  I will 
also assume that you are working on that solution unless otherwise informed.  

John Sherriff/John Lavorato
The memo was exactly as had been sent to you in draft form.  Responsibility 
for LNG continues to be somewhat unclear, however, as it pertains to global 
risk oversight, John Sherriff is officially responsible until further notice.

Any questions, please call me at 3-3324

I asked about loss limits a couple months ago and Ted said that they no 
longer report these numbers to the board. However, I think we should get rid 
of the whole concept.  VAR is the relevant concept.

I'm expecting more details from Bill re. Perry Gas but I'm quite pissed about 
this.  I will deal with my traders when I have the details.  On the Retail 
side, I think this is the problem in trying to set up a separate Wholesale 
trading group in retail which is clearly happening.  This wouldn't of 
happened it they were trading through us.

Subject: Perry Gas Companies, Inc.

John,

As discussed today, I have attached a summary of ENA's credit exposure to 
Perry Gas Companies, Inc (approximately $1,800,000).  They have filed for 
bankruptcy on August 28, 2000.  It should also be noted that our July 
settlement was not offset by our purchases due to an apparent oversight by 
the Settlements group, resulting in an additional $678,000 of credit 
exposure.  EES's credit exposure is still being researched but is estimated 
to be over $5,900,000 of additional exposure.  We are working with EES to 
resolve these issues as well.

As I mentioned today, Perry Gas Companies, Inc. was not approved for credit 
on any of these transactions and was on our Credit Watch List.  This company 
was not an approved counterparty and was granted a zero credit line.  

We are still trying to get the list of trades and traders for the July 
transactions.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Bill

Subject: Price Caps

The following summarizes recent price cap events in California.  I think that 
I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me 
know.  Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of 
Enron.

Regards,
Tim

New Cap Specifics
On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a 
new price cap methodology.
The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as 
can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to 
achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date 
might be.
The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:
Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven 
to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.
Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.
Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the 
following heat rate table:
  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap
  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10
  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70
  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90
  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90
  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh
Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.
Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior 
to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead 
system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior 
to the hour of delivery.

FERC Context
FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.
The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid 
cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of 
electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.
The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  
FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days 
after their authority expires)
FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its 
206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know 
what they will find or what they will propose.
The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will 
likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on 
11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral 
comments.
Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price 
caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.
It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into 
effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC 
extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from 
the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.

Impact of Price Caps
The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at 
different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets 
would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to 
say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap 
because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the 
cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.
Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   
Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new 
price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.
Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.
Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  
For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January 
through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January 
through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 
from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual 
observations.
We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the 
calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices 
for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each 
hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour 
could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly 
average cap value!
The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 
NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power 
prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

The Emmisions book under Kevin McGowan will take a one time $4 Million hit 
today.  This is to move the curves to better reflect the current market.  
This hit will stay in the Coal group but will be removed from its P/L from a 
performance measurement standpoint.  Now that the curves are corrected I 
expect a focus on building our emmisions trading business in the following 
ways:

1.  Understanding the fundamentals.
2.  Taking advantage of structural shifts that we forecast.
3.  Building more liquidity and being the primary market maker.
4.  Developing new traders.

Thanks
 
John

I guess we were wrong.

We were totally surprised by the a.g.a. number.  We need to work on are 
ability to predict it.  

Therefore, we probably net sold contracts today and will be under our 40 
Million limit.   I don't think there is any reason to change what we did 
today.  We will keep it in our pocket for 10 days unless you disagree.

You should include VP's and also you should make it a little clearer that I 
don't want to be on the schedule unless they have made a decision.

Subject: Feedback - Exec. Impact & Influence

Well, we finally got Greg Whalley enrolled in the "Executive Impact & 
Influence" seminar.  Each of you have been listed for feedback in the 
"peer/other" category.  It is crucial to Greg's success in the program that 
all feedback be submitted.  

I'll check back with you in a couple of weeks to make sure you are in receipt 
of the feedback forms.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor

Book this deal very conservatively.  ie.  set the curve so you pay credit 
reserve but show no income.  We will discuss in 2001.

Compressor service deals.
