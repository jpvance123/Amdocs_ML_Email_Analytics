Wally's drafts of these documents seem fine to me from a United States perspective.  As we discussed, I believe that a transaction where, in effect, a shareholder's right to redemption/liquidation proceeds and dividends is reduced would be analyzed as a redemption for United States federal income tax purposes.

Just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything--I have documents relating to the transaction between Enron and Enron Canada, and Enron Canada and Enron Canada Power, but nothing relating to the transfer between Enron Canada Power and ERMT Canada Corp. and nothing relating to the "drop down" of the note.  Is that correct?

Steve, as I mentioned, I will not be in the office tomorrow or Friday.  However, I will take my "picture" with me from our conversations today and if you need me, please let Lorna, my secretary know; she will put you in touch with me.

Best regards,
Kathy

Attached is a Shareholders Resolution authorizing the  name change.  I think we have the Shareholder Name correct, but if not, the  file is in word format and can be easily amended.  We are scanning the  other incorporation documents and will send shortly.  
 
The articles of amendment will be prepared and filed first  thing tomorrow as soon as we receive confirmation that the new name is not  conflicting with an existing name.  This is a NUANS search which has been  ordered, but not received yet.

For the Financial Masters I will draft and email shortly another paragraph that will need to be added to the Adoption Agreement to cover the situation where the counterparty has provided a parent guaranty under the ENA Master Agreement.  The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

Subject:	Adoption Agreement applicable to ISDA Masters
Importance:	High

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Subject:	Adoption Agreement applicable to ISDA Masters
Importance:	High

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

Actually, we realized that RMT is not going to be in the chain of
contribution and are revising the ENA and ERMT LLC resolutions to reflect
that (as well as the issuance of the Class A Units), so we will circulate
revised consents shortly - sorry for any inconvenience.

Please find attached for execution are the following documents necessary to
change the names of ERMT LLC to "NETCO Holdings Corp." and ERMT Corp. to
"The New Energy Trading Company":

1.   Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;
2.   Written Consent of Stockholder of ERMT Corp. approving same;
3.   Written Consent of Board of ERMT Corp. approving same;
4.   Certificate of Amendment to Certificate of Formation of ERMT LLC.

We will probably amend the LLC agreement later and reflect the name change
as well as anything else that comes up, but these documents will allow us
to file the name changes and have them effective today.  Please let me know
when you are able to get these executed and I will have Ann work with NRA
and get them filed this afternoon.  Thanks.

Mark, it looks like we will need a separate Tax id number for ERMT LLC per Stuart.  Do you agree?  Please advise.  Thanks, Deb

Please check with Mark Taylor or the tax guys, but if at all possible we
would like to have a separate EIN for the LLC - don't know if you always
have the same EIN as parent in LLC, but in our instance, the LLC is now
98.04% owned by RMT, and 1.96% owned by ENA.  We need to keep this entity
separate from its parent entities to the extent possible.

The EIN for ERMT LLC will be 76-0539176 which is the same as its parent
company, Risk Management & Trading Corp.  Deb

   Deb - do you know if we have obtained EIN numbers for both ERMT LLC and
   ERMT Corp.?  I assume since we got a bank account we have one for Corp.,
   but didn't know about LLC.  I also assume that the Canadian counsel have
   received the proper tax ID or other info for ERMT Canada Corp.  Also,
   fyi,
   we will be changing the names of the US entities today to "NETCO
   Holdings
   LLC" and "The New Energy Trading Company".  I will check with Mark
   Taylor
   on the Canadian name change.  Thanks.

Mark and Deb - just for your information, in the event that we would for
any reason need to do any additional corporate filings for the swapco
entities, I just wanted to remind you guys that the Delaware secretary of
state's office is closed on Monday for Veteran's Day - I don't think we
have anything else to file right now, but just in case something different
comes up over the weekend, we wouldn't be able to file anything until
Tuesday.  Thanks.

I don't thank that is a problem so long as the bank permits it - I know we
have sold bank accounts in the past, although I don't know that I have ever
documented it - do you need us to try to put together the documentation or
is that something you guys can do?

Mark - I assume that Peter or someone in Canada is going to take care of
the ERMT Canada name change - I would suggest NETCO Canada Corp., as we are
planning on calling LLC "NETCO Holdings LLC" and ERMT Corp. "The New Energy
Trading Company".  Just let me know - Thanks.

Also, where do you want to put new Wrapco - underneath ENA or ENE?  or RMT
for that matter.

Please check with Mark Taylor or the tax guys, but if at all possible we
would like to have a separate EIN for the LLC - don't know if you always
have the same EIN as parent in LLC, but in our instance, the LLC is now
98.04% owned by RMT, and 1.96% owned by ENA.  We need to keep this entity
separate from its parent entities to the extent possible.

The EIN for ERMT LLC will be 76-0539176 which is the same as its parent
company, Risk Management & Trading Corp.  Deb

   Deb - do you know if we have obtained EIN numbers for both ERMT LLC and
   ERMT Corp.?  I assume since we got a bank account we have one for Corp.,
   but didn't know about LLC.  I also assume that the Canadian counsel have
   received the proper tax ID or other info for ERMT Canada Corp.  Also,
   fyi,
   we will be changing the names of the US entities today to "NETCO
   Holdings
   LLC" and "The New Energy Trading Company".  I will check with Mark
   Taylor
   on the Canadian name change.  Thanks.

I will need a slate of officers and directors to form Wrapco.  I was
thinking SOG Corp., unless you object (Inspiration from sitting across the
table from Stuart for the last 10 days and he is the one who has
incorporated all the others).

Also will be changing the name of ERMT LLC to NETCO Holding.  Will probably
need to change name for Canadian corp as well.

Thanks,
Trish.

Provision of office space, which may include office space in the current
principal offices of the Administrator or such other location in Houston,
Texas or other location as Adminstrator may occupy, and such other office
space as may be reasonably required by ERMT from time to time during the

I think that is fine - the treasury group will just be acting at the
direction of ERMT and that's ordinary course.  Of course, the services
agreement should take care of all of that in the future when we have it
signed up.  We just might want to come up with an informal cash management
agreement in the interim such that ERMT would compensate ENE a nominal
amount for those services.

Also, Baker Botts has agreed to limit the prohibition on issuance of
subsidiary stock to "Significant Subsidiaries" within the meaning of S-X,
which I believe that swapco clearly would not be given the size of Enron.
So we should be OK on that front.

Deb,

That was an entity that Lavorato asked us to set up as an alternative to
Swapco in a non-bankruptcy, non-Dynegy scenario, so Mark Taylor would know
about it.  It was supposed to be SOG Corp., but that name was not available
so we started adding letters on until we got one that worked (the state of
Delaware was holding on the phone).  I would imagine that we will dissolve
this entity.  I will check with Stuart and Mark.

As for Swapco, I am going through the documents and will send you an email
listing all the signatures/action items we still have outstanding in order
to wrap this up.

Thanks for you help.

Again, these look fine.  One comment which of course Steve will be aware of:  if (as I believe is to occur) a U.S. entity holds the note, there will be imputed interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes, since the note does not carry interest.

Mark - we also need to make sure if we use an existing bank account that we
immediately discontinue any cash sweep upon its purchase by swapco - I
don't know if there was one for this account, but we just need to make
sure.

How many Class A Units should swapco issue for (valuation question) - I
know we had talked about $20 million - I was thinking that since we were
getting an exclusive for certain uses now, maybe we do $25 million which
would be a round number (we issued 1,000 units in exchange for $250
million, so $25 million would be 100 units).  Let me know what you think.
Thanks.

that is all you have so far.  the ECPC to ERMT document is on its  way.  the documents dropping  the Note from Enron Corp to ENA and then  to the LLC are coming from Morris Clark.  i will get him to forward them to  you.
>>> "Katherine Bristor" <KBRISTOR@skadden.com>  11/07/01 04:00PM >>>
Wally's drafts of these documents seem fine to  me from a United States perspective.  As we discussed, I believe that a  transaction where, in effect, a shareholder's right to redemption/liquidation  proceeds and dividends is reduced would be analyzed as a redemption for United  States federal income tax purposes.
Just want to make sure that I'm not  missing anything--I have documents relating to the transaction between Enron and  Enron Canada, and Enron Canada and Enron Canada Power, but nothing relating to  the transfer between Enron Canada Power and ERMT Canada Corp. and nothing  relating to the "drop down" of the note.  Is that correct?   
Steve, as I mentioned, I will not be in the office tomorrow or  Friday.  However, I will take my "picture" with me from our conversations  today and if you need me, please let Lorna, my secretary know; she will put you  in touch with me.

I added the sentence on the fees to say something like at the request of or
directed by ERMT.  I think this works, because we should only owe fees to
the extent of services provided that we request - in the event we don't
request any, we shouldn't owe anything.

As far as the fee structure, I would think it would need to be cost or
cost-plus.  Obviously, cost-plus looks better from an arms-length basis.

Thanks  Stuart, I'll add it in.  Two other questions -- should the
performance of the services be delayed until requested at a later date
(there isn't much need for it today) and what do we do about the fees?

   We can say the following:

   Provision of office space, which may include office space in the current
   principal offices of the Administrator or such other location in
   Houston,
   Texas or other location as Adminstrator may occupy, and such other
   office
   space as may be reasonably required by ERMT from time to time during the
   term of this Agreement.

   Let me know if you want me to add this or if you are going to do it on
   your
   end - Thanks.

   One more thing we need to consider is office space.  Can I just add that
   in
   as a "service"?

Attached is a revised services agreement with the fee schedule - it just
needs to be dated, the draft line removed, and then I had bracketed in the
fee schedule the premium to be paid for employee services (opportunity cost
premium).  I have it set up so that overhead and out-of-pocket expenses are
passed through at cost.

I will check with Anne and Roger Ross of our office on the license
agreement - I think it is almost done.  They provided a new "posting"
license agreement to me this afternoon, which I am still looking at.

The only corporate matter left to do is issue the "golden share" of ERMT
LLC, which based on this morning's version of the merger agreement, won't
be prohibited after we sign.  We have placed a couple of calls to our
contact to provide someone to do this, but have not heard back from them
today, so we will keep trying, but that shouldn't be a pacing item at this
point.  The only other thing on my list is a FERC license, and after
talking to Marcus this morning, I don't think Clinton is going to be an
option because the golden share (as opposed to just an independent
director) will apparently cause us to have to do a change of control filing
for that entity anyway.

You should be receiving the other documents shortly (i.e., the assignment of the PPA from Enron Canada Power to ERMT Canada Corp. - I am not sure of the note drop down but that shouldn't affect anything I don't think).  Otherwise, I appreciate your help with matters.  SHD.

Subject: Re: Acknowledgments and Resolutions


Wally's drafts of these documents seem fine to me from a United States perspective.  As we discussed, I believe that a transaction where, in effect, a shareholder's right to redemption/liquidation proceeds and dividends is reduced would be analyzed as a redemption for United States federal income tax purposes.

Just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything--I have documents relating to the transaction between Enron and Enron Canada, and Enron Canada and Enron Canada Power, but nothing relating to the transfer between Enron Canada Power and ERMT Canada Corp. and nothing relating to the "drop down" of the note.  Is that correct?  

Steve, as I mentioned, I will not be in the office tomorrow or Friday.  However, I will take my "picture" with me from our conversations today and if you need me, please let Lorna, my secretary know; she will put you in touch with me.

Best regards,
Kathy

Subject: RE: Draft of Market rate filing


          Marcus: Here are the others points I wanted to make, just briefly:

                1.  I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we file.
     Here's why:  
                    - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule 
                       on market-based rate eligibility.
                    - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very 
                      high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up
                    reasons.  I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we 
                    know they don't care about.  I think the real reason 
                    is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the 
                    new rule comes out.
                      - -  No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable
                     to get kicked out, too.  They might not want to give
                     MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new
                     rule.
                     - -    The best way to deal with that is to sit down with 
                     staff, go over the draft page by page, and see
                     what more they want.  But that would take too long,
                     because of staff's schedule.
                     - -   The second best way is for me to call Dan 
                    Larcamp or Mike Coleman, at FERC; tell them that 
                    we're not in a huge hurry, but we really don't want a
                    deficiency letter; read him the language in the draft
                    about how we'll comply with the new rule, and see if 
                    that's good enough.  If he suggests different 
                    language, we'll have to put it in there.
                     - - Alternatively, if we really want to try to slide this 
                    through without saying anything to FERC in 
                    advance, we can file it, and just hope that the 
                    language we have about complying with the new 
                    rule  is good enough.   But that's really not what I 
                    would recommend. 

         If we do decide to call FERC, I could call right away, and probably get an answer in time to file today.  If not, then certainly tomorrow. Otherwise, we're pretty much ready. 

             2.  I really do think that we could ask for 30 days without raising any eyebrows. 

                                  Good luck, and I'll talk to you soon.

Attached is a mark up of suggested changes to the filing as per my
voicemail earlier this morning.
In addition we will need to confirm whether Sandhills is a subsidiary of
Enron Corp.
We will be adding two contacts from our Regulatory Group.

Marcus,

  The attached revised draft "fixes" the ESVL/EVSL error.  Also, we
tried to catch the reference to ENA.  We will work on that further
tomorrow.  I wanted to send this draft to you now, however, so that you
could review it without constantly being distracted by seeing EVSL
throughout the document.  I know that would distract me.  I hope this
helps.

ESVL Corp will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. not Enron
North America Corp. In addition I see that some of the letters have
become transposed and ESVL often reads EVSL.
	
With ESVL Corp being a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. there may
well be other changes that need to be made.
	
Will speak tomorrow.

The draft filing is attached.  We are working on adding headers to the
rate schedule and code of conduct.  

Thank you for the information on New Albany.  I removed all references
to New Albany because we recently worked with Susan, Stuart and Robert
on that transaction.  Also we removed the references to five other
peakers Enron sold recently - we worked with Stuart to get those FERC
approvals.  In addition, we did not include a reference to North
Carolina Power Holdings, L.L.C. made in earlier filings.  We are aware
that Enron received 203 authorization to sell that entity earlier this
year.  We am uncertain about whether that transaction closed but we
assumed it did and removed it but need to confirm with you that it is
appropriate to remove it.  

Thank you for the suggestion about updating the information from the
triennial filing.  We will certainly double check to make sure the
companies we have listed in the attached draft have not been sold.
Also, we refer to exhibit 2 to the triennial filing made on January 14,
2000 rather than listing the names of Enron's generating units with
market-based rate authorization whose output is dedicated under
long-term contracts.  We will confirm that this information is still
accurate as well.  

Thanks again,

Cathy

In addition to Sandhills Enron also made a 203 filing this year in
respect of the sale of the New Albany plant to Duke. You will probably
need to run a check on Enron at FERC to ensure that between us we have
identified any changes to the three year update for EPMI which was
prepared at the beginning of this year.

Here is a copy of the revised license agreement reflecting the information
that you forwarded.

I also added a sentence to require that Enron list any "necessary"
third-party software.  If you think it is unnecessary, feel free to pull it
out.  I just added it for additional protection for Swapco.

I have included a blackline for review purposes and a clean copy.

Please call me at 650-802-3087 with any questions or comments.

Once the agreement is signed, it would prohibit us from issuing the golden
share, as well as the shares to ENA for enron online, unless we put that on
the disclosure schedule.  However, since I don't know that we can get a
golden shareholder today, we should probably consider putting this on the
disclosure schedule to the merger agreement.  Is it problematic for you to
disclose this to the other side?  If so, we might be able to have the
golden interest issued to an individual who can later transfer them to a
coporate shareholder.  Let me know what you think.

Subject:  Capital Contribution documentation


Under normal circumstances we would not need an Enron Corp. resolution
and in fact the Corporate Secretary and Treasury offices can handle
moving the money around so we do not propose to do an Enron Corp. Board
action unless you folks think it is absolutely necessary.  The other
resolutions we can get in place easily.

I think Notre Dame agreement contains restrictions on what we can do
with capital stock of subsidiaries after it is signed -- does that mean
we need to issue the Golden Share today?

Mark,

Steve asked that I forward to you the three attached contribution agreements that provide for the following

1.  Enron Corp. contributes $350 million to ENA;

2.  ENA contributes $350 million to RMT; and

3.  ENA contributes a license to ERMT LLC granting ERMT the right to use EnronOnline, and RMT contributes fourteen Chiracahua LLC interests and $350 million.

The open issues are as follows:

1.  Exact name of ERMT LLC;

2.  choice of law under the "Applicable Law" section; and

3.  the ERMT LLC member interests to be received by ENA and RMT in exchange for their respective capital contributions described above.  Such interests should equal the contributing entities' economic interests in ERMT LLC based on the fair market value of the contributed assets.  Susan and I will follow up with you tomorrow morning to resolve this issue.


Best regards.
