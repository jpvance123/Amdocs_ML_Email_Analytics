Subject: Carthage Plant Imbalance



I've discussed the Carthage Plant imbalance with Chad Cass at Duke Energy
(Carthage Plant operator) and Willie Shannon at Devon Energy and here is what
I've learned.  Duke and Devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance, which
according to Devon was approximately 240,000 due to Duke at 8/31/99.  Devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn't think it was that high.  
Both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong.  According to Duke the imbalance grew by 120,000 in September, 16,000 
in
October, and another 12,000 in November (all round numbers) bringing the total
to approximately 395,000 through the end of November.  Based on current month
estimates, Duke thinks January sales are 1,000-2,000/day higher than
production, and would like to see a cut in sales of 4,000/day effective Friday
1/21/00 in order to balance for the month of January.  Again Devon disagrees
with this daily overage, based on their production estimates, but since they
recognize an imbalance exists,  Willie @ Devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4,000/day effective Friday the 21st.  This will reduce
the amount of "excess" gas (gas daily-priced) that Enron has available to sell
at Carthage.
Additionally, beginning February 1st Duke requests payback to the plant of
5,000/day, continuing until the imbalance is worked off.  Devon should reduce
their 1st of the month availabe volume by 5,000/d to accomplish this, and 
Enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up February activity.
A key point to this imbalance issue, and one that I believe all of the parties
agree on, is that CES, now Enron, purchases Devon's Carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant, so any production-related imbalance is between Devon 
and
the plant (Duke) and make-up volumes only reduce what Enron receives from
Devon.  Enron is not buying the gas from Devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance.  However, since CES (and now Enron) is set up as
Devon's agent at Carthage, Duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make-up arrangements with Enron.  Enron in turn needs to verify
with Devon that Devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make-up.  Hopefully once actual make-up commences, Devon and Duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on.
Please call me if you have any questions @ (713) 693-2581.

Subject: Re: Koch Midstream Services Co  

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

Subject: Koch Midstream Services Co

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Thanks,

With regards ti the Koch Midstream, you could talk to Daren Farmer about it. 
Also, Carlos Rodriguez could help.

Deals 141877,141883, and 141884 (Koch Midstream) were in CES's system (and 
ours) as term sales. However,  those deals were terminated by CES. So, any 
volumes at KMID are sold to Midcon Texas P/L Operator at IF-.09. The purchase 
price is (.10) for base volumes and (.11) for swing volumes. For Feb, I 
zeroed the volumes in deals 141877,141833,141884, in Sitara. All of the 
volumes will be in deal 156256. O'Neal, do we need to risk assign this new 
deal? Julie, it is an evergreen deal.  MTPL takes whatever is produced at the 
points. Let me know if I can help with anything else.

Thanks,
AC

Rita, 

Since this is the case, I think we need to change the way we are booking this 
deal.  Currently, the CES-Devon purchase is on 8348, which is a dummy inlet 
to the plant.  Rather, we should probably just have the ENA purch at the 
tailgate, 986363, with a D2D ticket that transfers ownership to HPL, if 
necessary.  Please let me know what you think.

Mary

Let me try this one more time...

The attached changes are to those meters where a PVR is taken out for 
processing.  Effective 6/12/00, the Sea Robin Plant will be shut down for 
repairs and will not be operational again until 6/15/00.  The attached 12 
changes are to be effective 6/12/00 anc continuing until further notice.

Sorry for any confusion the previous e-mail may have caused.

Assuming the test results are good, the move from the CES desks to the 
appropriate ENA desks will take place either Wednesday or Thursday evening:

 CES - IM East   to ENA - IM East
 CES - IM Central  ENA - IM Central
 CES - IM Texas   ENA - IM Texas

This move will be done systematically for January forward business.  After 
this move is complete, there should be no active deals remaining on the CES 
desks.  The following is a list of deals that I wanted to bring to your 
attention and review.  One of the base assumptions expressed by all was that 
there were no transport usage tickets booked on the CES desk.  This is not 
true; however transport usage tickets will be included in the change over; 
therefore this will not be a problem.  On the East desk, three desk to desk 
deals will not be able to be converted (see below).  Once all CES deals have 
been changed to the East desk, I would imagine that these three desk to desk 
deals need to be killed.

Please advise if there are any questions regarding the desk move.  If any 
desk prefers to leave January as is and have deals moved February forward, 
manual deal entry will be involved (ending the deals as of 01/31/99 on the 
CES desk and creating a new deal on the appropriate physical desk).

SRM (x33548)


The data below is as of 01/24/00 7:00 PM

Clarissa,
Per our conversation last week, we are unable to increase EC 254, SP 13 and 
WC 45(20) due to the Tennessee seal on the 800 leg.  This shall confirm the 
volumes will remain at first of the month levels until the seal is lifted.  
At that time, I will recalculate the changes and notify you of any changes at 
that time.

Thanks,
Steve

Effective July1, 2000, I will be the new point of contact at Enron North 
America for Devon.  In an effort to
avoid duplication of e-mails to every scheduler on every desk, I would like 
to forward the volumes, revisions
or any other pertinent information to only the people who need it.   Could 
you please send me a list of the schedulers
who handle Devon on each of your desks and the pipes they schedule?  I will 
also forward a copy of any changes to 
a point person on each desk that will follow up with the schedulers to make 
sure they make appropriate revisions.

If you have any suggestions on how to streamline this process any further, 
please let me know.

Thanks,
Bev Beaty

Questions:

1.  At Agua Dulce, which pipe can the GP plant go into? Can it go into HPL?

2. Do you have nom forms for any plant nominations we may need?

3. For GEMC, is the Tejas plant at Thompsonville? Do you know how any of 
those points tie into HPL?

4. Do you have avails for MOPS production? The gas that is transported to 
Tivoli--what contract do you use?

5. For Kerr McGee, do you have the Entex contacts you speak with?

6. Is there a Waskom nom form? With whom do you speak over there?

7. For the avails sheet you sent, the first row of column titles is blacked 
out. Can you tell me what the row reads?

8. What volumes will come from Koch Gathering into Carthage for next month? 
We show conflicting numbers.

Thanks,

1.  At Carthage, the deliveries to Koch? What is that 15000 on your

2.  At Midcon Texas, you usually sell all the supply to its marketing 
affiliate, correct? Is so, is that gas termed up or do you sell it month to 
month?

3. Is the gas to Entex off Tomcat sold as base or swing? Don't they change 
the volume occasionally?Has Anadarko given you any avails for Jan? 

Thanks,

Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin S#745589.  And there are three deal out there for CSGT #639612, #639615, #745589.  The problem is that none of these deals have actuals.  It looks as though they have not been nom'd.

Daren are these deals real or what?  Why have they not been nom'd?  Could they be under another Dow company?

Tess, I'm leaving the office for a little bit today.  But I'll be back this afternoon.

Julie -
Please help!  Per Dow Hydrocarbon's Accountant, Marilu Trochta's e-mail below, (with attachment), there are volume and price discrepancies with what  ENA billed them and what she reflects in her system. ENA Invoice # 24636SA invoiced Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc, on CSGT @ B368-Brazos, per deal number SA639615, @ 685 per day (3/1/01 - 3/31/01) @ HSC GDP D.A. - $0.07/mmbtu. Vs. the 18,457 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow has and ENA did not invoice them for sales on Bluedolphin 250 and 249 vs. the 5,459 mmbtu @ $4.960 & 18,218 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow reflects.  I realize that the volumes ENA billed on the Brazos are estimates or noms. Problem: I need to confirm the March 2001, sale @ Brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale @ Blue Dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price).  Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, Sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler(s) are?
Thanks,
Tess

This is the David's answer:

The only one that I can think of that may be of use is the "CES Volume
Comparison" report ... that is the one that ya'll had for January that showed
all of the purchases and sales, by pipeline.  It is available for any month.
The reports that I regularly used were for helping to clean up current month
activity, which would not be of any use to you.

This is a follow up to the earlier email I forwarded regarding CES historical 
information. Note the deadline of 1/15, I believe that should be Friday 1/14 
so I need your responses by Thursday 1/13. 

Please fill out the spreadsheet for each area and forward back to me. I will 
consolidate our responses from a Logistics perspective. Lets have them add 
everything they need and if challenged we can re-review later.

Thanks - Bob

Subject: Re: Request for Application Report List  

Last month Richard Burchfield sent us the following list of reports that are 
available from CES's systems.  IT is working on a way to secure an electronic 
copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the 
electronic document management system.  While ENA is not liable for pre-2000 
business, we may need to assist with research as issues arise.  In order to 
get the ball rolling, we need to get a list together of the reports we need.  
Please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need 
and return it to me by Friday, 1/15/2000.  If you do not want any reports, 
please send me an Email letting me know that.  I have included samples of how 
to fill this out, and if you have any questions please give me a call.

If you aren't sure which reports you need based on the names, please get with 
any CES employees you have hired or with a CES transition employee to get 
clarification.  If you need samples of any of these reports please let my 
assistant, Pam Chambers, know and she will coordinate getting a sample report 
printed for you.  

In addition, I will need a list of the users and their logonid's who will 
need to have access to this data.  Please send that to me by the 15th as 
well.  

Thanks, Bryce

Attached is a list of 210 reports from Altra GMS.  Please note that we may not
be using all of these reports.  If you need me to scale this down to those
currently being used, I will need to do a bit of analysis.  Many of the base
reports, those denoted in the spreadsheet with filename-location (1st column) 
=
master.mdb are not currently being used at CES.  Let me know if you have any
questions.

Clay,
     I have had several requests from the ENA business groups. now that the
agreement has been finalized, for report lists from your key applications, 
those
being, Altra GMS and Risk Works( there may be others as people become more
aware). There will be a need for information for ENA to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period. We feel this would be an easier process to 
work
through if ENA knows what kind of information they can request as we go 
through
the transition.

Thanks, Richard

Questions:

1.  At Agua Dulce, which pipe can the GP plant go into? Can it go into HPL?

2. Do you have nom forms for any plant nominations we may need?

3. For GEMC, is the Tejas plant at Thompsonville? Do you know how any of 
those points tie into HPL?

4. Do you have avails for MOPS production? The gas that is transported to 
Tivoli--what contract do you use?

5. For Kerr McGee, do you have the Entex contacts you speak with?

6. Is there a Waskom nom form? With whom do you speak over there?

7. For the avails sheet you sent, the first row of column titles is blacked 
out. Can you tell me what the row reads?

8. What volumes will come from Koch Gathering into Carthage for next month? 
We show conflicting numbers.

Thanks,
Ami
713/853-9272



Here goes ...

1.  I know Tennessee, HPL, and Tejas are at the tailgate of the plant, and I
suspect Midcon Texas is there as well.

2.  I'll fax you a copy of the nomination form that Steve Locke uses for Agua
Dulce and Carthage ... those are the only ones in Texas that we nominate.

3.  The Tejas Plant as well as all of the other Gulf Energy receipt points 
from
PennzEnergy are exclusively Tejas/Gulf Energy points, and it takes transport
charges to move the gas through Gulf Energy to interconnects, such as
Thompsonville.  The Jennings Plant does have a split connect with Delhi, but
operationally PennzEnergy much prefers to flow into Gulf Energy (lower 
pressure
= higher volumes).

4.  Mustang Island 759 for January is again 1,903 mmbtu/d, which Peoples will
pick up at the wellhead.  Mustang Island 785 is 4,100/d, which leaves 2,200/d
available to sell assuming we continue to transport 1,895/d to FGT/Tivoli for
Peoples.  Our IT agreement on NNG is #78581 to move gas from the wellhead to
onshore.

5.  The Tomcat gas has been sold to Entex into Midcon Texas for so long that I
don't think Maria even talks to them anymore each month.  Tammi provides them
with the volume when she does the deal each month.  But we can certainly
provide an Entex contact if the gas is sold to them again in January.

6.  There isn't a Waskom nomination form.  The trader for this gas, Mike
Landolt, talks to Ben Britten (President of New Waskom Gas Gathering and 
Waskom
Gas Marketing).

7.  You must be referring to the page of offshore avails that begins with
Sabine Pass 13.  The 6 columns that appear blacked out read as follows:  PVR,
PVR, Avail, DBQ, DBQ, and Remainder.

8.  The Koch-gathered volumes behind the Carthage Plant for 1/00 are 12,443
mmbtu/d.

Subject: Re: More Questions




1.  At Carthage, the deliveries to Koch? What is that 15000 on your 
whiteboard for. Who is it to? Are the volumes termed up?

2.  At Midcon Texas, you usually sell all the supply to its marketing 
affiliate, correct? Is so, is that gas termed up or do you sell it month to 
month?

3. Is the gas to Entex off Tomcat sold as base or swing? Don't they change 
the volume occasionally?Has Anadarko given you any avails for Jan? 



Round 2:

1.  The 15,000 @ Carthage for Koch is an estimate of what we anticipate we 
will
want to sell into Koch ... and it shows up on the Koch whiteboard as a supply
(from Carthage).  During bidweek the traders will decide how much they 
actually
want to show going to Koch, and how much will be labeled base and swing.  Mike
Landolt has been our sole Koch trader and he typically takes some Carthage gas
into Koch, but I wouldn't say a particular volume is termed-up.

2.  Other than very rarely shippling the Jennings Ranch volume over to NGPL,
we've always sold all of the Midcon Texas volumes to the affiliate ...
currently done one month at a time.  John Hymel has been the trader for these
volumes.

3.  The Entex sale @ Tomcat has always been Gas Daily because that is the way
Kerr-McGee prices the supply ... and Entex has taken all the swings.  The
January volume is 2,312/d.

David

p.s.  I still don't know my schedule for Wednesday ... everyone who is being
asked to work Transition is meeting individually with management on Wednesday
and the schedules haven't been provided yet.  As soon as I know more I'll let
you know, but I'll understand if you make other lunch arrangements.

Mary,

This is all the information that I have when Ami first looked at all the CES 
information.  It does not mention a processing agreement, but that does not 
mean that there isn't one.





Daren - do you know anything about a processing agreement for the Devon gas 
at the Gulf Plains plant as it relates to the CES acquisition?

With pre-bid coming up, how should I handle CES? Who will be responsible for 
June info? Also, who on the trade floor will be the Devon contact? Bob 
Superty asked me to be the point person initially, so maybe he has another 
person in mind (Ed Terry or Kathy Kelly - secondary contacts) that he would 
like to handle it besides someone on the Texas desk. This way it could free 
our group up from that task. Part of the reason I was handling it was because 
I wanted to make sure nothing that affects Texas slips through the cracks, 
especially in the beginning. Please advise.

This is a follow up to the earlier email I forwarded regarding CES historical 
information. Note the deadline of 1/15, I believe that should be Friday 1/14 
so I need your responses by Thursday 1/13. 

Please fill out the spreadsheet for each area and forward back to me. I will 
consolidate our responses from a Logistics perspective. Lets have them add 
everything they need and if challenged we can re-review later.

Thanks - Bob

Subject: Re: Request for Application Report List  

Last month Richard Burchfield sent us the following list of reports that are 
available from CES's systems.  IT is working on a way to secure an electronic 
copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the 
electronic document management system.  While ENA is not liable for pre-2000 
business, we may need to assist with research as issues arise.  In order to 
get the ball rolling, we need to get a list together of the reports we need.  
Please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need 
and return it to me by Friday, 1/15/2000.  If you do not want any reports, 
please send me an Email letting me know that.  I have included samples of how 
to fill this out, and if you have any questions please give me a call.

If you aren't sure which reports you need based on the names, please get with 
any CES employees you have hired or with a CES transition employee to get 
clarification.  If you need samples of any of these reports please let my 
assistant, Pam Chambers, know and she will coordinate getting a sample report 
printed for you.  

In addition, I will need a list of the users and their logonid's who will 
need to have access to this data.  Please send that to me by the 15th as 
well.  

Thanks, Bryce

Attached is a list of 210 reports from Altra GMS.  Please note that we may not
be using all of these reports.  If you need me to scale this down to those
currently being used, I will need to do a bit of analysis.  Many of the base
reports, those denoted in the spreadsheet with filename-location (1st column) 
=
master.mdb are not currently being used at CES.  Let me know if you have any
questions.

Subject: Request for Application Report List



Clay,
     I have had several requests from the ENA business groups. now that the
agreement has been finalized, for report lists from your key applications, 
those
being, Altra GMS and Risk Works( there may be others as people become more
aware). There will be a need for information for ENA to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period. We feel this would be an easier process to 
work
through if ENA knows what kind of information they can request as we go 
through
the transition.

Thanks, Richard

Sorry I'm just now getting back to you.  Here are some answers to your
questions.

Waskom is a field in East Texas (Harrison County) where we purchase gas from
PennzEnergy at the Bryson C.P. and Jeter #2 wells.  The gas is termed up to 
New
Waskom Gas Gathering (NWGG) through June 2001 (the term of the PennzEnergy
purchase).  We then buy the gas back from NWGG into our Tetco East Texas pool
... also termed up through 6/01.

Virginia Field used to be associated with NGPL, but several years ago
PennzEnergy worked out a processing arrangement with Corpus Christi Gas
Gathering, so the gas is now termed up with CCGM through 6/01 ... priced off 
of
the Houston Ship Channel.

Jennings Ranch used to flow into NGPL through a gathering line, but a couple 
of
years ago NGPL sold that line to Midcon Texas, so we now handle it as another
Midcon Texas property.  Sometimes we sell it at the meter to Midcon Texas 
(KN),
and sometimes we ship it through Midcon to our NGPL South Texas pool.

Carthage:  Altra picks up their gas in their Cartwheel agreement.  The
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement.  It is not much
different than a Hub agreement, except it allows title tracking.  TGT on the
whiteboard refers to Texas Gas ... East Ohio takes their gas into Texas Gas on
a couple of different transport contracts.

Let me know if you have more questions.

David

I was on vacation last week and Victor sent this out, but apparently not to 
everyone
who needed it.  Some of you have called looking for the numbers, so I'm 
sending it again.
 Please e-mail me and let me know if you do not  need this information.  
Steve at Devon told
me this morning that he is working on revisions this afternoon.

Thanks,

I entered the wrong volume on the High Island 140 platform for the change

Excess).  Attached is a revised nomination.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Thanks,
Tina Valadez

I have rolled # 143559 through July 2000 to cover the purchase from 
Republic.  We sell this gas to Duke Energy Field Services (#143558 for Jan - 
Apr,  CES-Duke Energy Field Services, Inc ).  The counterparty on this deal 
has been suspeneded, so I created # 316727 under the counterparty of Duke 
Energy Field Services Marketing, LLC.

Hillary - Please extend the CES-Duke counterparty or attach the correct Duke 
counterparty to this deal.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Ami,
Attached is the list of June availabilities for enron to sell.  I have listed 
the pipeline beside the offshore volumes and am in the process of doing the 
same for the onshore.  We are still waiting on a couple of volumes on some of 
the outside operated properties and have estimated availabilities for those 
properties.  Additionally, the PVR factors are estimated and will also be 
provided as they become available.

Please feel free to call me with any questions you have.

Thanks,
Steve

Christina,
The attached shows the volumes that should have been nominated effective 
6/15/00 and 6/16/00.  The Sea Robin plant was back up for those two days and 
gas was processed resulting in a decrease for PVR.  Effective 6/17/00, the 
plant was down again and volumes were increased to reflect no processing 
loss.  I forwarded those volumes to you on Friday, June 16.

Let me know of any questions you have.

Thanks,
Steve

Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin S#745589.  And there are three deal out there for CSGT #639612, #639615, #745589.  The problem is that none of these deals have actuals.  It looks as though they have not been nom'd.

Daren are these deals real or what?  Why have they not been nom'd?  Could they be under another Dow company?

Tess, I'm leaving the office for a little bit today.  But I'll be back this afternoon.

Julie -
Please help!  Per Dow Hydrocarbon's Accountant, Marilu Trochta's e-mail below, (with attachment), there are volume and price discrepancies with what  ENA billed them and what she reflects in her system. ENA Invoice # 24636SA invoiced Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc, on CSGT @ B368-Brazos, per deal number SA639615, @ 685 per day (3/1/01 - 3/31/01) @ HSC GDP D.A. - $0.07/mmbtu. Vs. the 18,457 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow has and ENA did not invoice them for sales on Bluedolphin 250 and 249 vs. the 5,459 mmbtu @ $4.960 & 18,218 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow reflects.  I realize that the volumes ENA billed on the Brazos are estimates or noms. Problem: I need to confirm the March 2001, sale @ Brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale @ Blue Dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price).  Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, Sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler(s) are?
Thanks,
Tess

Apr,  CES-Duke Energy Field Services, Inc ).  The counterparty on this deal

FYI - we will probably be asked what historical information is needed in our 
shop from a Logistics perspective. I would suggest asking the new CES 
employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal 
with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as 
well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer 
and asset transactions. 

Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to 
the IT folks.

The following summarizes the decisions made during our  user & IT joint 
meeting today regarding the handling of CES historical data.

A.  Bryce Baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify CES reports 
that need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that 
will be accessed               via the Electronic Document Management system.
B.  Jeff Peoples will be working with Bryce Baxter to produce reports using 
CES system via ISDN line at Enron building - this will continue to be part of 
his duty until  the job is done (Jeff joined ENA as a member of Sitara group).
C.  Larry Daze will be working with Jeff Peoples and Bryce Baxter to ensure 
all reports are loaded on our EDMS with proper indexing.
D.  No need for manupulating CES history data is necessary  (i.e. downloading 
on spreadsheets).  Therefore, no data will be kept on the disk other than 
EDMS.

Hey Ami,  We have a little issue on Transco regarding Devon production.  Does 
your contact @ Devon know if we are responsible for scheduling  PVR for them. 
Please read note below and let me know if we need to talk to anyone on our 
side.  THANKS!

FYI,

Transco has called wanting to know who is responsible for nominating Devon's 
PVR.  We do not have access to their contracts to do 
the noms.  CES use to have Transco do it for them and so did we for January 
and February, but nothing was nominated for March or April.  I
mentioned this to Nelson and Dan Junek back in March, but nothing was 
decided.  At one time, Devon did not want to give us access to nominate
their PVR because they did not want us to have access to any of their 
information.  Could you find out if we are responsible for the PVR and if we 
are, they
have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts?  Maybe you 
will have better luck than I did.

Thanks,
Bev

Tina,
Koch never returned my calls. Based on the contractual information, we may be 
putting ourselves in a risk area by 'assigning' the deals without proper 
documentation. The documentation that was supplied did not refence any ENA 
agreements, nor any specific meter numbers. If the purchase was indeed a 
meter/well sale; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired 
and the effective date. Since we are apparently the supplier, the risk is not 
as substaintial as if we were the purchaser. However, without documentation 
we are basically relying on the relationship btw Koch & Duke.

Subject: Re: Koch Midstream Services Co  

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

Subject: Koch Midstream Services Co

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Thanks,
Tina Valadez

Daren,

Can you please verify for me whether we took over any old imbalances that CES 
had?  The reason I am asking if we got a letter from Kinder Morgan asking us 
to verify an imbalance.  It looks like it would of been an imbalance between 
CES and Kinder Morgan.  We don't show anything in our system and want to 
verify that we shouldn't.

Thanks and if I need to provide any further information, please let me know.

Attached are the co-owners volumes.  I will furnish revised Devon volumes 
this afternoon.  I noticed you have a PVR of 10% on the American Central 
volumes.  Chad Cass at Duke says this should be closer to 22%.  The 10% 
applies to MCF.

Hey guys,
You may or may not be aware, but I am taking over coordinating changes with 
Devon from Ami effective 7/1/2000.  These
are the first preliminary numbers from Devon.  I will send information for 
the 1st to all of you, but the changes will only go to
the pipes affected.  If you have any suggestions as to how this can be 
handled smoother, I would love to hear from you.  Also,
if anyone else needs these volumes, please let me know.  

Thanks for your help.

Hey Joe,

Here's the response I got with regards to Tomcat. I've place another call 
into David and let him know that the information we received included most 
points except for Tomcat. I'll keep you informed. 

What I know is that the gas is sourced at MI 587 and moved on KM's firm 
contract. For as long as CES remembers, they sell the gas to Entex. Entex 
chooses the pipe off which they take--usually Midcon--also, HPL Channel, or 
Tejas. KM is invoiced directly. Volume is approx. 2395. The deal with Entex 
is written up monthly. KM pays on a basket of indices. Entex pays on the 
highest index.

Tess, 

We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.  However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.  Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?  What did we pay?  Let me know this and we can proceed from there.  Nelson Ferris did these deals.  I will talk to him after I hear from you.

Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin S#745589.  And there are three deal out there for CSGT #639612, #639615, #745589.  The problem is that none of these deals have actuals.  It looks as though they have not been nom'd.

Daren are these deals real or what?  Why have they not been nom'd?  Could they be under another Dow company?

Tess, I'm leaving the office for a little bit today.  But I'll be back this afternoon.

Please help!  Per Dow Hydrocarbon's Accountant, Marilu Trochta's e-mail below, (with attachment), there are volume and price discrepancies with what  ENA billed them and what she reflects in her system. ENA Invoice # 24636SA invoiced Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc, on CSGT @ B368-Brazos, per deal number SA639615, @ 685 per day (3/1/01 - 3/31/01) @ HSC GDP D.A. - $0.07/mmbtu. Vs. the 18,457 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow has and ENA did not invoice them for sales on Bluedolphin 250 and 249 vs. the 5,459 mmbtu @ $4.960 & 18,218 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow reflects.  I realize that the volumes ENA billed on the Brazos are estimates or noms. Problem: I need to confirm the March 2001, sale @ Brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale @ Blue Dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price).  Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, Sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler(s) are?
Thanks,
Tess

Hello:

It was in the process of fractionation.

I will be happy to also send it email.  I haven't in the past but will do so 
from now on.

>>> <Beverly.Beaty@enron.com> 02/20/01 04:16PM >>>
I received a fax from you today regarding the Keystone Plant Tailgate
volumes for March.  I was
wondering if you forward this via e-mail as well.  I don't always receive
faxes on a timely basis and I'm
not sure the appropriate scheduler always receives the information.  Please
let me know.

Thanks,
Beverly

The question is not that "cut and dry". However, for the month of March Enron paid Spinnaker @ IF HSC -$0.085. 
Currently the volume is posted under deal ticket  #144271 with is the deal tick for gas daily production.
This production should be moved to Deal ticket  #144264 with is the IF.

Do you pay Spinnaker, for gas purchases? (See Daren's question below, re: 03/01 purchase price from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264), Need to know if  price is at IF or Gas Daily?

Tess, 

We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.  However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.  Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?  What did we pay?  Let me know this and we can proceed from there.  Nelson Ferris did these deals.  I will talk to him after I hear from you.

Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin S#745589.  And there are three deal out there for CSGT #639612, #639615, #745589.  The problem is that none of these deals have actuals.  It looks as though they have not been nom'd.

Daren are these deals real or what?  Why have they not been nom'd?  Could they be under another Dow company?

Tess, I'm leaving the office for a little bit today.  But I'll be back this afternoon.

Please help!  Per Dow Hydrocarbon's Accountant, Marilu Trochta's e-mail below, (with attachment), there are volume and price discrepancies with what  ENA billed them and what she reflects in her system. ENA Invoice # 24636SA invoiced Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc, on CSGT @ B368-Brazos, per deal number SA639615, @ 685 per day (3/1/01 - 3/31/01) @ HSC GDP D.A. - $0.07/mmbtu. Vs. the 18,457 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow has and ENA did not invoice them for sales on Bluedolphin 250 and 249 vs. the 5,459 mmbtu @ $4.960 & 18,218 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow reflects.  I realize that the volumes ENA billed on the Brazos are estimates or noms. Problem: I need to confirm the March 2001, sale @ Brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale @ Blue Dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price).  Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, Sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler(s) are?

Republic Royalty is one of my CES deals.  They sent me an invoice for May 
2000 production, but I do not see a deal for May.  Does either of you know if 
this deal was extended under a new deal number?

Subject:	RE: Deal 819348

I'm assuming that since this deal is on the new Texas Desk, and that no new deals have been negotiated under CES counterparties that this deal is actually a truncated deal that was split to move open production from ENA - IM Texas (which I believe no longer exists as part of the post-HPL/AEP processes) to ENA - IM Lonestar. The deals have been split several times & when this occurs, as they are all part of the original contract #. Basically (assuming that this was the case) it becomes a "1 of 3" scenario. The deals are kept on the same contract number to help track the continuity of the pieces. Although changing to a new contract will not skew anything, it is generally best to try to keep them all together. (Unless the deal was split for a contract or counterparty issue). Desk splits just basically move the deal to a new book. Since the move was already made, I'm just going to let it stand unless anyone have any objections.

Also, since this is a CES deal there is not a need to reconfirm as none of the CES deals (those still carrying the CES prefix) were to be confirmed by ENA.
Thanks all!
Cyndie

Subject:	Deal 819348

I was researching deal 819348 (CES - MidCon Texas Gas Services Corp) and found that it was incorrectly attached to contract 96035432 (in fact, the GTC Firm had THREE deals attached).  Since one of the deals ended 03/31/01, we won't bother correcting that one, but this deal needs to be moved.  I set up contract 96061912 and attached it today.  THIS DEAL STILL NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED BY CYNDIE BEFORE THE CP IS INACTIVATED.

Elizabeth, could you please revalidate this deal?

My team, could you please add this one to your daily deal count report?

Ellen, could you please reconfirm if necessary?

Thanks, all.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Julie -
Per Daren's repsonse below, can you correct price on this deal for 03/01. Currently under 639615. 

Joyce-
Per Daren's message below, the sales volumes are currently under deal # SA639615. Let me know when they've been reallocated to 639612.

Thanks-
Tess

Ok, We should be paying Dow based on the index price.  But, it should be IF HSC - .07 instead of -.06.  Sales volumes should be allocated to deal 639612.

The question is not that "cut and dry". However, for the month of March Enron paid Spinnaker @ IF HSC -$0.085. 
Currently the volume is posted under deal ticket  #144271 with is the deal tick for gas daily production.
This production should be moved to Deal ticket  #144264 with is the IF.

Do you pay Spinnaker, for gas purchases? (See Daren's question below, re: 03/01 purchase price from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264), Need to know if  price is at IF or Gas Daily?

Tess, 

We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.  However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.  Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?  What did we pay?  Let me know this and we can proceed from there.  Nelson Ferris did these deals.  I will talk to him after I hear from you.

Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc.,  stated  on 4/24/01, re: ENA deal # SA 639615, that their 03/01 price for ENA  sales on CSGT @ B368-Brazos # 368 (i.e. cowtrap), is IF - $.06.  We are invoicing them at HSC GDP DA.  Need to know which price is correct and copy of confirmation.

Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin S#745589.  And there are three deal out there for CSGT #639612, #639615, #745589.  The problem is that none of these deals have actuals.  It looks as though they have not been nom'd.

Daren are these deals real or what?  Why have they not been nom'd?  Could they be under another Dow company?

Tess, I'm leaving the office for a little bit today.  But I'll be back this afternoon.

Julie -
Please help!  Per Dow Hydrocarbon's Accountant, Marilu Trochta's e-mail below, (with attachment), there are volume and price discrepancies with what  ENA billed them and what she reflects in her system. ENA Invoice # 24636SA invoiced Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc, on CSGT @ B368-Brazos, per deal number SA639615, @ 685 per day (3/1/01 - 3/31/01) @ HSC GDP D.A. - $0.07/mmbtu. Vs. the 18,457 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow has and ENA did not invoice them for sales on Bluedolphin 250 and 249 vs. the 5,459 mmbtu @ $4.960 & 18,218 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow reflects.  I realize that the volumes ENA billed on the Brazos are estimates or noms. Problem: I need to confirm the March 2001, sale @ Brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale @ Blue Dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price).  Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, Sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler(s) are?
Thanks,
Tess

I have created two new deals in Sitara.  You will need to get with someone in 
Volume Management to reallocate volumes from the old tickets to the new deals 
for Jan-Sep.  The Logistics group will be able to adjust October forward.  

Deal #s:

144052 --> 440092
144049 --> 440093

Let me know if you have any questions.

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

Subject: Koch Midstream Services Co

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Thanks,

Ami,

Please add Rhonda Robinson and Howard Camp to the list.  The items I would 
like addressed are as follows:

VM - Allocations:
1.  List of meters and allocation structures - callouts, swings, etc.
2.  Listing of external meter contacts
3. Copies of expense contracts
4.  Overview of the transactions - this may not be accomodatable in this 
meeting, but an overview of some of the transactions, i.e. from deal to 
settlements
5.  Ensure all expense contracts are set up
6.  Discussion of any impact to any of the major industrial customers, i.e. 
Entex, Equistar, HL&P

VM- Transport
1.  Imbalances
2.  # of shippers, contracts, invoices
3.  Any special transactions that need to be handled via the settlements 
process
4.  Copies of contracts
5.  Customer contact listing for each account

I realize that all of these things may not be addressed in this meeting, but 
they have to be answered by someone very soon in order for VM to do our 
jobs.  Hopefully, if the CES representative cannot answer the questions, he 
can direct me to someone who can and QUICKLY.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks for your role in this meeting.
