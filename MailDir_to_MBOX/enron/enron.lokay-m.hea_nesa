Michelle Lokay,

Good morning!  Before bid weeks gets cranked up next week, I wanted to remind 
you to register for the upcoming Sports Tournament.  It's only a few weeks 
away, and as additional incentive to do so, Chairman Bobby Norris has decided 
to hold a special drawing for members who have registered AND paid by October 
2.  A door prize worth approximately $500 will be awarded to some lucky early 
registrant, so get your form in today!  Have a good weekend and we'll look 
for you on the 16th.

Hi Teresa,
Believe it or not, I just got my directory...I guess they finally figured out 
where I am located!  I also found out that I need to correct the company for 
my directory information.  It needs to be Enron Transportation & Storage 
instead of Enron Corporation.  Thanks and talk to you soon!

NESA/HEA Members ~

Don't forget to join us tomorrow (Thursday, January 18th) for our first
Membership Mixer of 2001 at PAESANOS LOUNGE located at 213 Milam between
Franklin and Congress Streets in the downtown Market District.  Sponsored by
NATIONAL ENERGY & TRADE, LLC, the fun begins at 5:00 p.m. and your first
drink is free when you mention you're with NESA/HEA at the door.  There will
be a buffet available for our group as well as valet parking.

Remember that PAESANOS also offers a great selection of fine cigars for your
enjoyment while you network with other industry colleagues, and special
guest artist, YVONNE WASHINGTON, performs at 8:00 p.m.  We're expecting a
great turnout, so don't be left out!

As part of our Membership Drive, bring a new member with you and become
eligible for a great door prize, graciously donated by Kay Atchison
(NESA/HEA Co-Chair) from Duke Energy.  It's a great opportunity to renew
your dues as well.  Again, if you didn't receive your renewal in the mail,
I'm attaching a pdf file that can be opened in Adobe Acrobat.  If you don't
have that application, download it FREE from our website at www.nesanet.org.
Hope to see you there!  You can't afford to miss this event!

All NESA/HEA Members:

Attached is a copy of the revised Bylaws as drafted by the Executive
Committee's Transition Team.  The Transition Team was charged with, among
other duties,  reviewing the two sets of bylaws of NESA and HEA, and to
combine the two into one document that would best serve the association.
The Team has prepared a revised set of bylaws that is more consistent with
how the combined organization operates and is asking for your vote to
approve them.

Please email your response to revise the attached bylaws to Bill Harper,
NESA/HEA President at william.harper@nesanet.org as soon as possible.  The
results will be announced at the Annual Meeting in San Antonio on September
10.

Thank you for your cooperation and assistance.

Sincerely,

Teresa Knight
Vice President, Member Services
NESA/HEA

Tournament changes and a completely redesigned Two Man Flush game will
better accommodate the shooters in this great event.  Those who register and
