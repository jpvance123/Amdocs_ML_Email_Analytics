Hunter,

Let me know when a good time to meet Lee and Christina is as they were 
planning on taking us to lunch later this week. They have done alot of work 
with data aggregation off the web so they should fit the bill.

Let me know when a good day is.

Take care,

Doug

Subject: MKM Demo

I  spoke with some of you concerning the Market Knowledge Management (MKM) 
project.  At this time, we would like to demonstrate the MKM pilot  to you.

To refresh your minds, MKM is a one-stop shopping for market data and 
associated activities.  The project is done in collaboration between two 
groups in Houston and one in London.  In November/December 1999 some of you 
took part in user forums to discuss the feasibility of a one-stop shop for 
market data

Background:
The intention is that all existing systems (i.e. various databases and 
services) will be linked through a common infrastructure that will allow all 
these systems to provide the services they have always provided plus a set of 
standard services, such as:
Security
Data Validation
Notification
Auditing, and 
Calculation.

In addition, it will allow client applications to ask MKM for the data and 
services they need instead of going to individual systems.  The point here is 
that the user (or application) 
will not need to know where the data resides, and
will have a uniform level of services across all systems

Demonstration:
A pilot was developed to prove the underlying technology and to provide users 
a simple demonstration of the product to derive exact user requirements.

The demo will include the following components:

Browser: provides a user interface for publishing and retrieving a limited 
selection of price and volume data for gas and power busines units;
Time Series Index: stores time series metadata;
Message Station: an inbox which holds inbound time series data;
TIBCO messaging backbone: underpins MKM and is transparent to the user;
and Connectivity to two market data servers:- LIM (Houston) and PR1P(London).

The remaining components will be delivered in following phases.

I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to demo of the product.  
I would like to schedule the demonstration for Friday, June 23 at 1:00.  
Could you also RSVP me.  I am also attaching a document which will give you 
more information of the MKM project.    If you cannot meet me on the 
suggested date, I can you a demo of MKM at your desk at your convenience.  If 
you would like to go through the browser, the web address is 
http://test-mkmtimeseriesindex.enron.co.uk/default.asp?canregister=true.  Use 
your network id and password to gain access to the web site.  If you have any 
questions please call me at 35733.


Thank you in advance,
Thomas

Dave-

Thank you for taking the time last week to speak at the floor meeting on 29.
I come from an engineering background and work in a financial reporting role 
for Andrea Reed.
I have found the transition from engineering to finance at Enron a natural 
one with my eye on details and
the analysis process.

I have attached Gwen Weddington's resume which I would like to pass on to the 
Fundamentals Group for the Gas Business,
which you mentioned is now being formed.
I think that she could be a valuable addition to Enron.
She is currently an Operations Manager at Air Products and Chemicals' 
Industrial Chemicals Group.

Can you tell me to whom I should forward this?

Thanks,

Carol

Carol Marshall
Enron
Houston, TX

Dear Carol:

I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you on Friday.  As I mentioned,
I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with Air
Products and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have read
about Enron.  Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends who
might be kind enough to "keep their eyes open" and share thoughts and ideas
as to companies I should contact.

I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume.  As
you can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strong
operations background.  I would certainly enjoy another position as an
Operations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well.
I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range of
industries.  Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would be
very encouraging.  I am open to any avenues you suggest.

Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances.  It
seems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few select
introductions.  Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or who
can direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated.  The more contacts I
make, the more opportunities I can uncover.

If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down.  I will contact you
again in a few weeks to discuss your ideas.  Thank you in advance for your
help.

Sincerely,


Gwen Weddington

The page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three 
decimal points.  We need to add Canada numbers.  Also is it possible to make 
the basis column more straight?

I know coordinating these moves is a real pain, but we have 4 commercial 
individuals that need to be sitting at the East gas desk: Frank Vickers, Gil 
Muhl, Phil Demoes, David Jones. Effective Jan. 1, they are part of the East 
gas team, and it's critical they sit with them. Could you get with Scott and 
Hunter and see what else can be done? Thanks.

Ina,

Have you made other arrangements for Frank's group or do we need to get 
together and try to come up with a "quick fix"?  I know before when I was up 
there inquiring about this, you had said that you were working on this same 
request for Scott Neal, so I wanted to check with you first before doing 
anything.

Thanks

   Lorie, 

   Adam is on the churn for tonite.  However...Colin Tonks has laid claimed 
for those spaces with Hunter Shively's approval. 

   Also, thought you might need to know that with Adam's departure, that 
makes only three desks available (3247c,d and e). 

   3247a & b are currently being occupied by employees of Chris Gaskill with 
no plans to move to the best of my knowledge. 

    This of course, still leaves Kim Brown looking for (3) spaces on 32.   

   Additionally,  regarding Brenda Herod, her final count is (30) 
consultants, (26) current employees and (9) to be hired in January.  

  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance, 
  Heather, x33278

Heather,

Is Adam's group on the churn for tonight?  Does this mean the spaces will 
become available to Frank Vickers and others after tonight?

Thanks

  Per Marcie's email below, Adam Plager and his group will be moving out of 
their current locations
  on 32 and will be moving to 25.  

  I will follow-up with Marcie and make sure she knows there is space 
reserved for them on the 1/2/01 churn.

I have found space for Adam and his group on 25 and am in the process of 
moving him hopefully this week as your needs suggest.

Subject: Churn for Market Intelligence - Adam Plager


  Marcy,  

  Today,  Adam Plager was asked to find a space off of the 32nd floor, 
effective Jan. 2, 2000.  
   
  As I am sending you this email, we do not know where to move him.  I have 
contacted 
  Lorie Belsha who handles the majority of the floor planning and their are 
no spaces to
  move him.  She advised that we look to find a space with his direct report 
Bryan Powell 
  and asked me to contact Peggy McCurley, who then advised I talk to Cheri 
Westbrook. 
  When talking to Cheri Westbrook, she indicated that you have some space 
allocated 
  to you, but she was unsure if you have specific plans for them or if you 
would have (4) 
  spaces for Adam, to accomodate his immediate need.  

  I will be out of the office when you are back in on Wednesday, please 
advise Adam if 
  there is any space available.  I will call in to see if I can be of further 
assistance in this 
  search. 

  To help you expedite this process when you have come back (in hopes that 
you 
  have space available for Adam), I have attached the churn request.  You 
will need to 
  fill in the areas that I left blank (i.e, titles for new hires, cost 
center, TO location).  All the 
  equipment to be moved has been entered on the churn.  

  Additionally, when sending the request into the move-team, please say " 
This move 
  request is for the (5) spaces reserved by Heather Choate for the January 2, 
2001 churn".  

  

 Regards, 
 Heather Choate, x33278

What is the latest on the EOL feeds.  I talked to Dave last week and he 
indicated it was no problem.  I have a meeting with him today at 2:30.  Let 
me know what I need to tell him.  Also, what is the latest with the late 
nominations.  I talked to Jason and he told him it was due to producers 
changing their noms.  I have not talked to George about this issue.  Jason 
also thinks that the problem is shorter lived that PGL&C has indicated.  
Please write back with PGL&C's position on the matter.

Thanks

Are you going to want a separate risk book for these transactions and will we

Brent,
?
There is a way to stop the gain control from  automatically adjusting. The 
parameter that needs to be modified in?the  html file is UseAutoGainControl. 
It needs to be set to FALSE. This will stop the  volume from going down on 
Hunter's and Patrice's clients.

You might try turning off AGC (set  UseAutoGainControl to FALSE) in the 
HTML.? This should stop the mic volume  from changing.? Also check if AGC is 
set in the sound card.

Perhaps:
??? if the client is set such that the  property
???????  UseAutoGainControl=TRUE
??? then the client is attempting to adjust the microphone level  
automatically.
??? A guess on my part is that if the sound card is somehow unable  to

The first product looks good.  We need to consider having one product for 
parks and loans.  I think we should make a market in this product.  Let me

deals?

The two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a 
basis can be calculated.  We also need to add NIT (AECO).  John McKay manages 
this product.  He should know the hours of trading and which day should be 
selected for index calculation.

Shelly, 

Hunter spoke with Li today and agrees that her first rotation should be in 
Vince's group doing modelling, etc.  This will give her the broadest 
experience for a first rotation.  I'm sure the other person in question, 
Vikas, will do very well in Hunter's group.  

Thanks for your help.

Jeff

Dear Johnny Palmer,

I am a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at Boston University, specializing on
statistics.  I have worked at Citizens Power (now Edison Mission Marketing
and Trading) since April of this year developing software for their
trading desk and risk management department.

In particular, I have implemented state-of-the-art
procedures to price derivative contracts on gas and electricity, and
worked on default correlations among counterparties.

Attached is a html copy of my vita.

Sincerely,


Carlos J. Morales
Department of mathematics and Statistics
Boston University

Dave Forster from Eol may be calling you.  I am trying to get the Hub online 
and I am having trouble because Enron does not own more than 50% of the 
Midwest Hub.  An EOL lawyer may have found a solution.  I have asked Dave to 
call you.  I wanted to give you a heads up.  

Thanks

John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas 
desk VaR dropped to $3.8


Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think 
it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider 
sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, 
maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to 
both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them 
to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts

Subject: Re: GRE  

Chris & Kelli,  I just wanted to clarify that GRE's actual testing is 
scheduled to begin in March, and this Sunday is a one-day deal for them to 
blow down their turbines.  The powerpak deal that we have with them is for 
the testing period of March and April.  I have talked with our Storage team 
regarding putting the gas in on Friday and Saturday of this week and pulling 
out on Sunday but they are really tight and aren't sure they can handle it.  
Is there any way that we can buy the 4500 MMBtu for Sunday only? And, if so, 
what is the cost differential?  Thanks!

Subject: Re: GRE  

Kelli - the GRE deal is set to begin in May (per the long-term agreement).  
The interconnect is complete and testing will begin this coming Sunday.  GRE 
is responsible for noms during testing.  (As you may recall, ENA will be 
responsible for noms to storage once the deal begins.)  GRE wishes to buy 
4,500 MMBtu for this coming weekend. This purchase is not covered under the 
long-term gas deal; therefore, I presume you'll show GRE an offer at  Demarc 
or Ventura

Your contact (during testing) will be Janet Bowers (Omaha x7141).  

Please give Janet a call to arrange this weekends gas supply.  We may be able 
to sell/deliver the 4,500  on Thursday or Friday.

Janet -  Kelli can be reached at (713) 853-1828.

Call with any questions

Thanks

Subject: Retention Policy on Trading Tapes

Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month (except with respect to litigation matters) will be destroyed on 
that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or 
Richard Sanders.

Subject: MKM Demo

I  spoke with some of you concerning the Market Knowledge Management (MKM) 
project.  At this time, we would like to demonstrate the MKM pilot  to you.

To refresh your minds, MKM is a one-stop shopping for market data and 
associated activities.  The project is done in collaboration between two 
groups in Houston and one in London.  In November/December 1999 some of you 
took part in user forums to discuss the feasibility of a one-stop shop for 
market data

Background:
The intention is that all existing systems (i.e. various databases and 
services) will be linked through a common infrastructure that will allow all 
these systems to provide the services they have always provided plus a set of 
standard services, such as:
Security
Data Validation
Notification
Auditing, and 
Calculation.

In addition, it will allow client applications to ask MKM for the data and 
services they need instead of going to individual systems.  The point here is 
that the user (or application) 
will not need to know where the data resides, and
will have a uniform level of services across all systems

Demonstration:
A pilot was developed to prove the underlying technology and to provide users 
a simple demonstration of the product to derive exact user requirements.

The demo will include the following components:

Browser: provides a user interface for publishing and retrieving a limited 
selection of price and volume data for gas and power busines units;
Time Series Index: stores time series metadata;
Message Station: an inbox which holds inbound time series data;
TIBCO messaging backbone: underpins MKM and is transparent to the user;
and Connectivity to two market data servers:- LIM (Houston) and PR1P(London).

The remaining components will be delivered in following phases.

I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to demo of the product.  
I would like to schedule the demonstration for Friday, June 23 at 1:00.  
Could you also RSVP me.  I am also attaching a document which will give you 
more information of the MKM project.    If you cannot meet me on the 
suggested date, I can you a demo of MKM at your desk at your convenience.  If 
you would like to go through the browser, the web address is 
http://test-mkmtimeseriesindex.enron.co.uk/default.asp?canregister=true.  Use 
your network id and password to gain access to the web site.  If you have any 
questions please call me at 35733.


Thank you in advance,
Thomas

I talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If 
the Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every 
"Midwest Hub" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the 
Chicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a 
problem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.  Laura 
manages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above 
agreement.

Thanks

The questions that Gas Daily is receiving most likely pertain to the issue 
that Nicor was closed on Friday but the weekend index published substantially 
different from the Thursday index.  We did not transact at Nicor City Gate on 
Friday and did not submit a change in trades to Gas Daily.  I will discuss 
this with you tomorrow.

Subject: Chicago Midpoint pricing for December 21, 22, and 23, 2000




On December 21, 2000,  I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas 
flow on  December 22-26, 2000.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of 
$15.76.   This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted 
via the telephone. 

The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:

Nicor Gas Company was closed for  their company holiday on Friday, December 
22nd.  As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for  the December 
22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 
22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 
22nd (even though they were closed)  for the December 23-26 time period, 
which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.  I 
received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing 
concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal 
activity that transacted on December 22nd.  

My practice is to take the price as reported on Enron Online.  On occasions 
there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will 
impact the Enron Online price.  Due to timeliness of sending the price 
report, my volume is overstated, as opposed to intentionally reporting 
erroneous information.

Issue#1)

It is not the physical microphone that is having the problem.  The microphone 
volume on the software declines as the speaker talks.

Hunter,

Does this happen using different microphones?
Brent: Can you swap the mic of an affected user and see if this persists?

I forwarded this request to our Product Marketing group. We have had this
request from other users as well. I will keep you updated on the response.


> 3) We have trouble with latency.

I spoke with Brent briefly a few moments ago and suggested changing the
jitter buffer value to 1. If the speech becomes choppy then we will have to
revert to 2 and put in a sniffer on the route to see if there is anything
hardware-wise that may be affecting the data throughput.

Jim--please take a look at these articles that will come out in the Crains 
magazine tomorrow.  You'll see that there are both opportunities and potholes 
for us on this issue.    It is very likely that we will get sucked into this 
debate----the ENA/ Peoples deal which has generally floated under the 
regulatory radar in the past is inevitably going to become more prominent. 
(Evidence even before these articles is that I received a call from the ICC 
staff late last week asking if we could participate in an ICC meeting on 
natural gas issue on Jan 23).  

The articles (and the gossip that I have heard in the past few weeks) point 
out that Peoples is in hot water politically--I would hate to see us dragged 
into that sesspool.  On the other hand, if ENA sees significant business 
opportunities that could be opened up to them in Illinois by a change in the 
regulatory climate, this could be the time to make the play....while the 
issue is hot and there may be pressure on the ICC to take some steps that 
they normally would not.

I'd appreciate it if we could plan a call to talk about strategy on 
Illinois.  I am going to have to give a response to ICC on Tuesday and we 
will need to determine who would particpate in the meeting at the ICC.  Roy 
and I had put in a call to Laura Luce last Thursday to discuss the request 
from the ICC...I have not heard back from her, but Roy may have.  

Are you available on Tuesday for a conference call?

Sue & Roy -- We thought that you would find the attached articles regarding
the high natural gas prices in Illinois to be of interest.  

To solve gas bill crisis, turn heat up on Peoples
Crain's Editorial - January 15, 2001
Considering the finger-pointing that's going on between politicians,
regulators and Peoples Energy Corp. executives, one thing is becoming
obvious: Fixing blame for the recent astronomical rise in natural gas prices
is much simpler than fixing the problem.
Nonetheless, all of these factions bear some responsibility for this
winter's monthly home heating bills, which, for many residents, are soaring
by hundreds of dollars over last winter's tabs. Each of these groups should
be held accountable for working to devise systems and strategies designed to
blunt future price spikes.
Make no mistake about it, this crisis will not melt away with the spring
thaw. Limited natural gas supplies and increased demand will continue to
pump up bills, rattle price stability and, along with other climbing energy
rates, become the economy's unwelcome "X" factor.
The weight of dealing with these pressures rests with the utilities,
especially Peoples Energy, the city's natural gas provider. To start with,
the utility's management must protect customers by anticipating escalating
demand, hedging risk and locking in gas prices when it can.
These are common business practices, used by corporations and even some
conservative utilities. In Michigan, for example, gas providers charge fixed
rates to customers and hedge their risk by purchasing gas years in advance
under long-term supply contracts. Right now, Michigan pays 29 cents per
therm, compared with the Chicago area's whopping 98 cents.
Peoples argues that it tried to lock in prices but was shot down when it
could not reach an agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC),
which regulates the utility, on what the fixed rate should be. In walking
away from the deal, Peoples left customers with the current rate system and
dumped the burden of price fluctuations onto them.
In essence, instead of managing risk, it put its customer base at risk.
Considering that decision and the subsequent fallout, critics are asking
whether Peoples, a regulated monopoly designed to profit from the public's
needs, is acting in the best interest of its customers. Those paying heating
bills - which in some cases are as much as 300% higher than last winter's -
are right to say no, as is Mayor Richard Daley, who's outraged at Peoples.
More troubling are concerns that Peoples management may not be up to the
challenge of resolving this crisis, especially if its recent handling of the
political fallout is an indication. The company acts as if the public has no
right to question its tactics or motivations. And when the Chicago City
Council held a public hearing about the heating bills issue last week,
Peoples Energy Chairman Richard Terry didn't show up.
At these prices, it's not asking too much for the chairman of the gas
utility to explain his company's position. That's not a job meant for a
public relations executive or a consultant, who were among the Peoples
advocates who actually did attend the council hearing.
The ICC shoulders its share of the blame, too. It should have more zealously
monitored the gas supply situation and the utility's plans. Now, the
commission is playing catch-up by holding an investigation into what Peoples
knew about the soaring gas prices and when it knew it.
Let's get an answer to that important question and find out once and for all
if there is price-gouging going on.
Just as critical, however, is the need to foster a statewide regulatory
environment that encourages gas utilities to use more hedging, storing and
price-control strategies. If there is any ambiguity in state law about the
utility's ability to do this, then the General Assembly should change the
rules and open up the process.
Peoples management, regulators and politicians must get beyond the blame
game and find a way to better insulate the public from surprise spikes in
energy prices.
Otherwise, we're all just burning money.

Gas flare-up gives city hot idea: Become a utility
But co-ops mean high risks, mild rewards

city-owned buying co-op. Photo: Steve Leonard   
January 15, 2001
By Steve Daniels <mailto:sdaniels@crain.com>
It's easier said than done.
That's something an angry and frustrated Mayor Richard Daley is about to
learn as his staff begins investigating plans to take on some gas-purchasing
duties on behalf of city residents.
Mr. Daley is livid over what he contends is Peoples Energy Corp.'s failure
to anticipate the rising cost of natural gas, to mitigate a huge run-up in
residents' monthly heating bills this winter. He thinks the city can aid
bill-payers, and punish Peoples, by developing a system that will funnel
lower-cost gas to ratepayers.
But the track record of other municipal gas utilities, or buying
cooperatives, shows that such a system isn't likely to achieve more than
modest rate savings unless the city is willing to take on significant
financial risks.
To protect against the kind of price spikes that have hit customers this
winter, the city would have to buy futures, or long-term contracts, that
could leave it exposed if prices were to decline substantially.
In addition, the city would have to contend with thorny issues such as the
collection of overdue bills and potential cutoffs of service to non-paying
customers - activities for which municipalities are ill-suited.
Despite the risks, utility critics contend that city intervention is
appropriate.
"It's a creative approach, and we need those," says Martin R. Cohen,
executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer watchdog group.
"These are extreme times, and innovative approaches are called for."
Most municipalities that have gotten into the gas-buying business have been
unwilling to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts that can shield
consumers against the sort of price spikes that have sent this year's
home-heating bills soaring nearly 300% compared with last year's. That's
because such arrangements can boomerang on customers, locking them into
higher-than-market gas costs if prices fall.
New York experience
"We wrestled with this: Should government really be in this business?" says
David Fountaine, village administrator in Hamburg, N.Y., a suburb of Buffalo
that formed a buying group for its residents in April 1999. "In our case, by
being in it, we've helped our residents."
Hamburg and nearby Sloan, N.Y., together hired a unit of Texaco Inc. to
supply gas to residents who signed up for the communities' program. New York
opened its natural gas market to competition five years ago, so residents
can choose either to remain with their gas utility or select an outside
marketer.
About one-third of Hamburg's 3,300 households buy gas from the village.
Those residents' gas bills last winter were 8% lower than the bills of
households that stayed with Buffalo gas utility National Fuel Gas Co. Last
month, when gas prices shot up, the village's price was 15% lower than the
utility's.
But Mr. Fountaine says the village takes no outsized risks, making no
long-term bets on the direction of gas prices. Rather, it simply relies on
its contractor to manage gas supplies as efficiently as possible.
Chicago officials are looking at programs like the one in the Buffalo area,
but also may be willing to take bigger risks to achieve greater savings.
"We know there are a lot of relatively new risk-management techniques being
used by large (natural gas) consumers," says William Abolt, commissioner of
the city's Department of Environment. "We want to know, what does the
industry do to manage (price) risk? That's what the reasonable company does,
but that's not what the local gas company does."
City officials need look no further than Downstate, where the Illinois
Municipal Gas Agency buys natural gas on behalf of 20 communities that
provide monopoly gas service to their residents. Last September, the agency
locked in prices for 50% to 75% of their customers' winter gas needs,
rolling with the market for the remainder.
That strategy is serving the agency's customers well. They're paying around
70 cents per therm - the measurement the gas industry uses for billing -
this month, compared with the 98 cents per therm that Peoples is charging
Chicago-area customers.
"There's no reason why investor-owned utilities couldn't do the same thing,"
says John Bell, the Municipal Gas Agency's general manager. "I think (a city
program) is a viable alternative if they don't like what they've got."
For its part, Peoples supports the city's desire to become involved in the
market. The move poses no threat to the utility because it doesn't profit on
gas purchases and still would make money on the delivery of the gas to
customers.
Meanwhile, the city is just beginning to consider alternatives. Although Mr.
Abolt says no system will be developed in time to help Chicagoans during
this trying season, a program most likely will be launched next winter.
Weighing the risks
The city's top priority will be to help low-income residents most vulnerable
to escalating heating bills, but all Chicago residents might be able to
choose between the city's program or remaining with Peoples. And one
possibility being considered would enable residents to choose either a fixed
price for gas before winter starts or rates that rise and fall with the
market.
While a fixed-price approach certainly looks good in hindsight right now, it
can have a downside if not managed properly.
In the Buffalo area, the two major private gas marketers offering fixed
prices to households recently dropped out of the residential market, forcing
some 23,000 customers to scramble back to the local utility for gas service.
To meet the unanticipated demand, the utility was forced to purchase gas on
the sky-high spot market.
It just such risks that Chicago officials are weighing. Says Mr. Abolt:
"This is not an overnight thing. You don't just snap your fingers and it
happens."

Please let me know the names of the internal traders who will need execute 
rights to the new Park & Loan transaction.

Hunter,

Are you going to want a separate risk book for these transactions and will we 
want this set up on EOL?

Thanks for your help.

Okay - let's try this again.  The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, 
at 2:30 p.m. in room EB3125B.  I know that there are some conflicts with this 
time, but it's the closest time slot that is convenient for all.

Hunter:  John called Chris Williams today asking what was happening, so I 
returned his call and told him that I would check.  He interviewed with you 
and your group on 8/22/2000, and it appears that John may have been a 
candidate for your 4:00 am analyst position.   From our conversation today, I 
would guess that he was too experienced (and,thus,too expensive), but I don't 
know if there is yet another position I am not aware of.    Would you give me 
an update on his status so that I can call him back?

Thanks,
Molly

FYI.   We need to get back to Doug as soon as possible.  This should be a 
good

As we discussed, my new boss, TJ Aruffo is interested in a tour of Enron's
Houston Trade Floor.  He is available the morning of the 1st.  He is flying
out of Intercontinental at 2:45 PM.  As far as I know he will be travelling
alone.  He  has not requested my presence yet.

The purpose of his visit is to see first-hand a world-class energy trade
floor and to begin networking with key industry personnel.  He is new to
this side of the business.  His previous role was NiSource CIO; so he comes
into his new position with a systems and process oriented view.   His
responsibilities at NiSource encompass the regulated gas supply management
and gas control operations of eight of NiSource's gas utilities (two are
primarily managed by EnergyUSA-TPC - NIFL and Kokomo).  He is responsible
for Bay State (and Northern Utilities), NIPSCO, and the Columbia
Distribution Companies (five LDC's).  We are currently fragmented in
Massachusetts, Columbus and Indiana and are in the process of evaluating how
to bring this together, functionally, locationally, or not at all.  TJ
reports to Pat Mulchay, who is President of the Merchant Energy Division.
Pat reports directly to Gary Neale, our CEO.

TJ's previous background includes a stint at Fidelity Investments, so a
trade floor is not new to him.

Please confirm Enron's address and if you don't mind, recommend a hotel that
is convenient.  Let me know who will be meeting TJ then we can  turn the
details of finalizing the arrangements over to TJ and your designee.  Thanks
for your help.

EOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.  The biggest reason is 
EOL.  I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an 
increase in EOL trading in the Gulf Coast Region.  Let me know if you need 
more info.

Subject: Peoples Energy Project Status



The Peoples Energy Project is Currently On the Public Internet.  The version 
that has been released is not in its final phase.  
Many of the rules of the business have to be tested and changed to reflect 
the correct data representation.  The only way 
for us to do this is to have the current users who will be using the system 
to verify the correctness of the data.  Due to this fact, it 
is not recommended that this system be used for trading purposes until the 
portion of the system being worked on is verified to 
be in fact correct in its representation of the data.  It is still imperitive 
that  this system is viewed daily for its correctness, validation, 
fault tolerance and efficiency on a daily basis, for this is where we devise 
our metrics on the systems completeness.  

Currently there is a new update version of the application that resides in 
Chicago that delivers the data to the website.
Our current contact has been sent to a training in Canada and will not be 
available until Jan 20, 2001.  Due to this I would like to set up a meeting
to:

 Application Status Report
  1. Show the Parts of the application that currently are ready to be used
  2. Discuss the portions of the application that are currently in "Beta" 
(not ready)
  3. Discuss a testing process to bring these portions up to Production 
Status (ready for usage)

 Evaluate Current Project
  1. Does the project currently meet customer needs
  2.  Additions / Changes to fit needs
  3. Business Rules Changes
 
 Customer 
  1. Customer Site Feedback
  2. Developer / Management Feedback 
  3. Outstanding Issues

The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weeke=

is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous=20
interview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on =01&selling=01=
8=20
candidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.  Students will=
=20
arrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.  We have=20
activities planned for the entire weekend.  The goal is to implement a Supe=
r=20
Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions=
=20
while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20
employees.  To that end, we have made the following changes:
Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =
 =20
We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to hav=
e=20
small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=
nd=20
four (4) students.  There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant=
=20
before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua=
te=20
more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages=
=20
(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will=20
facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We=
=20
have allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To=20
facilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the=20
interviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students wil=

In prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates. =20
Interviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.  The remainder of=

the time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that=
=20
all interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation=

forms are completed and input prior to the meeting.=20
Decision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on=

Monday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday=20
following the interviews and lunch.  The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 P=

to 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron=01,s executive manag=

Hunter-

Thanks for letting me show you the Gas Model. I want you to know I will 
always go out of my way to help you and your traders develop and use good 
models.

I need tools, and Kevin has been fantastic supporting with these. He's alread 
bought a $25,000 Sun server to be dedicated to real-time mathematical models.

Can  I can tentatively count you "in" on the SAS software. Our current 
license expires Sep. 14 (ie, soon), and I need to knowing where a total of 
$40,000 is coming from. As it turns out, I "need" to count on Gas for around 
$15,000, which I note is a lower price to you for unlimited user access than 
you would pay for a single-workstation SAS PC license. Remember, not only are 
many of the calculations you need  too big for Excel, my own Gas Model will 
run in SAS and will be available to you. And, Carmen Ayala in Contract 
Administration, will support you every step of the way here, since her 
assignment is to wean Enron from an obscenely expensive emerging addiction to 
SAS-PC

I'm sorry to have to bug you like this, but I have a deadline staring me in 
the face.

Clayton

The control automatically sets the volume to the optimal level when you use
the mic to eliminate unwanted noise and static. I had Patrice go to our
corporate demo site and speak for a few minutes. We did not hear her volume
go down. I was logged in on my PC and I also dialed in with my cell phone to
see if I could notice anything abnormal. But, she sounded fine. The other
thing is that, according to Patrice, she is the only one having this problem
with her volume going down which is why I am gravitating towards a localized
problem.

Brent: I will be back in the office tomorrow morning. Can you spare some
time?

Thanks.
Darshan.

I think that if a product does not trade for a day, we do not post the 
product the index or product description in the index page.  I think the 
index calculation hours should be 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.   How fast can the 
index page be calculated and posted?

can you redo with day + 1 products only?  Also can you display the data 
without placing multiple data in a given row?  I have attached an example.  
The first row in this spreadsheet is how I would like to see the data.  This 
way I can sort the data in any fashion.

Thanks
Hunter

Subject: ENA Analyst and Associate "Brownbag" Presentations


It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality 
flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well 
as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in 
ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your 
respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in 
the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your 
respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an 
informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:

Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other 
departments
Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted 
Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a 
presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between 
12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.

Dave

Any more documentation on this deal?

Midwestern Gas Transmission
5/18/00 - Midwestern filed notice of a negotiated rate deal with Dynegy.  It 
provides for a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a tiered indexed 
commodity rate based on spreads.  If the index spread is less than or equal 
to $.02, then the daily commodity rate shall be $.01.  If the index spread is 
greater than $.02 but less than $.10, then the rate shall be 50% of the 
spread.  If the index spread is greater than $.10, then the rate shall be 
$.05 plus 75% of the spread exceeding $.10.  The deal is effective 5/1/00 
through 10/31/00.

It is ENA's standard language which includes language relating to being able

different language in any master including GISB.

Stephanie,


 We would like to set up the central books as their own Master books to 
prevent all deals being booked to Hunter's Intra-Central book.
 Could you please set up the traders with their own physical and financial 
book names in EOL?
  - attatched is a lists of the book names.


 Thanks,


  Kam

Andy - can you please forward this email to your book person to change these attached deals from ENA- PGL  to ENA - and the actual counterparty.  Our confirmation guys should send out a confirm to verify these deals.

Tony is continuing to look for additional Harper \ northern border supplies.  I will let you know if he finds anything of interest.

Subject: Re: Price Spikes  

Steve--Thanks.  This paper sheds alot of light on why Cal. is problematic.  
Jeff, Jim S., and I talked about it today because of Kevin's desire to be 
able to float his entire position against the pool and the reg. group idea 
that some "penalty" or separate charge should be attributed to those that 
cause the big congestion (primarily because of the Cal. problem that day of 
is cheaper than day ahead due to the caps.)

Christi,
 I found this to be a very interesting paper on the California Price Spikes.  
The conclusion is that price caps are infact creating part of the problem.

Subject: ENA Late Nominations

Jason:

I was confronted this morning by Mark DiValero and he expressed his concern 
over ENA's nominations over the last two weeks.  He said that PGL is not 
staffed to confirm all 4 cycles of the nomination process and that ENA will 
start to get cut after the 2nd cycle if nominations are not correct.

I told Mark that I would get back with him early next week and let him know 
why ENA has had to consistently make changes at every nomination cycle.  
Also, please inform your schedulers of the risk that they are taking if 
nominations are not correct after the 2nd cycle (especially on weekends!).  

Please talk to your schedulers and let me know why we can't get our 
nominations correct.  Thanks!!

Is the chart range wide enough?  Kelli and Patrice do more than 250 trades 
per day.

We have only the heights for now - maybe someday we'll see days 8 and 9. 
Good luck,

Subject: Employee Locations - Gas Teams

Dear Admins,
Please help!!
In an effort to receive correct EPSC & EIS invoices for January, we need to 
ensure that Joann Holloway has correct Cost Center and location information 
for all employees in the various gas teams.  I am attaching a file with 
employees and cost centers which was used by HR to make the "mass" change to 
the new cost centers after the reorg.  I would appreciate each of your help 
in dropping in Locations for each of the persons in the cost centers you are 
responsible for.
In addition, please check the position field for each person also, as I would 
like to be sure I have correct information on a
go forward basis.  I will then send this file to Joann Holloway for her use 
in compiling invoices for January.

The bad news is that she needs this quickly.  Please take the time to drop in 
this information and return to me by 3:00 pm
on Thursday, January 11.  I know this is short notice, but if we get it 
correct from the beginning, it will be easier to maintain in the long run.

Thanks in advance for your help!  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

Edie Leschber

I would like to see the composite.  I think my home computer has logon access

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

For your review, I have attached a list of individuals and the days they need 
to arrive.  The first group arriving on Saturday will have the option of 
playing golf or going to the spa.   They will begin their workshops on Sunday 
morning and will be departing on Monday morning.   The group arriving on 
Sunday will have the same option.  They will begin their workshops on Monday 
morning and departing on Tuesday.  

There is a Dinner on Sunday night at 8:30 for everyone to attend. 


Please let me know if you will be travelling outside of these travel dates, 
as well as if you are interested in Golf or the spa.  

Thanks,
Lynn

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Fundamentals group.  I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to

has anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would 
work like this:

Chic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable 
injection                      .015 bid     .025 offer
Chic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable 
injection    .015 bid     .025 offer

I think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a 
try.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.

I would like for Colin and David to create security that gives access to the 
site for certain users only.  There are too many people logging in that we do 
not know.  We need to begin creating this list.  

All Central, Texas, East, West, NYMEX desk and Chicago office traders 
(Richard Tomaski will provide the Chicago office names)
Power traders
Fundamentals Gas, Power, EIM
Fred's group
Lavo, Whalley, Kitchen, Frevert,

If you can think of any more let me know.  Can we implement the security this 
week?

Ok, Done.

Just an FYI for WebOps:  gasfundy.dev.corp.enron.com and 
gasfundy.corp.enron.com have a special group named 
"Corp\Web_GasfundyBanned".  This group is added at the wwwroot level and deny

Actually, I mean the root web, everything but the virtual directories.



Ok, could we create a group called GasFundy_banned or something, and put 
these users in it?  They
would be denied access to the root of http://gasfundy.corp.enron.com and

Hmm,  I've got a unique situation where there are a group of ex-gas traders 
they need to block from our gas site.  I don't know of a common group

Thanks,

Not easily.  We could explicitly deny access to certain groups, but many 
times this results in unintended users being restricted because of unexpected 
group memberships.  Deny will always overrule allow, but it can cause quite a 
few problems over time.

I feel like such a heel.  There is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and I 
had placed my phone and flight info in this pocket.  Thank you for continuing 
to look for the phone.  I am embarrassed.

I had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked 
for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn 
the fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group 
to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the 
front-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person 
can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants 
front-end production to be handled by her group.  

We ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It 
seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database, the 
group will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow.

Brad

Today (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she 
must be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact 
statement was "If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have 
another talk".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is 
probably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define 
the exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to 
leave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.

Hunter

Okay - let's try this again.  The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, 
at 2:30 p.m. in room EB3125B.  I know that there are some conflicts with this

Tim

I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may 
help you prepare for Thursday.

Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this 
production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily 
load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 
55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal 
differences in load.

Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However 
these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume 
more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the 
regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and 
move gas to the areas of greatest demand.

Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if 
the daily production is growing or shrinking.  

Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.
Hunter

Hunter:

The equipment is installed behind Rain's desk and the network port has been 
made active.  The Server Team has to activate the sender, but they're running 
some printer issues this afternoon, and may not be able to get to it today.  
I am leaving for vacation today so the Remedy ticket # is: 170276.  You can 
call x34888 and reference the ticket number for tracking while I'm gone.  The 
Team Lead for Trader Support on your floor is Don Adam, and he may be able to 
help facilitate a resolution for you if nothing happens by tomorrow afternoon.

I just spoke with Bill Morrow and he has a request.  Peoples is holding their 
April 4th Board of Directors meeting in Houston to highlight their production 
business.  Tom Patrick would like Enron to give the Board members a tour of 
our trading operations sometime between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.  He has also 
suggested that we provide an update of enovate as another agenda item.  I 
realize this is very advance notice, but I thought I would give you both 
heads up so that you could try to hold this time open on your calendars. 

Thanks - Gregg

Hunter,

I wanted your opinion on how to respond to the following e-mail.  It sounds 
like Caroline Abramo is sharing some of Mike's research and the Fundamentals 
research with some of the hedge funds.  Do we want to keep sending her the 
information or limit it to certain pieces of research.  Do we make any/enough 
money off of their business to provide them with our internal research?  I 
have told her in the past that the quarterly production numbers that we 
provide are for internal use only, but it sounds like some of the information 
is going outside of Enron.  Let me know what you think.

Subject: RE: industrials

Chris - this is feedback on Elena's sheets - the ones she puts together as 
part of Mike Robert's Monday package.  I think they have real potential to be 
very valuable but we could use a bit more digging on them- the feedback is 
from Dwight Anderson at Tudor who has been in the commodity markets for years 
and who has a very fundamental approach to his positions- one of his major 
tenants is that industrials (chemicals) can not produce at above $7 gas - he 
has done in-depth analysis of this and probably has a number in mind for how 
much comes onto the market at these levels- I will try to ascertain. He also 
wholeheartedly believes that more production will come in 02 and will see 
prices go below current levels- I know Sachin is working on the production 
numbers- it would like to see us project these out a bit further and have the 
historical production data as well - in order to see how extreme the changes 
in production have been.

The info that the funds share with us is very privileged - we generally do 
not share it with many people- I'd like to include you on discussions so that 
we can help them with their views as well as ours to bang out better trading 
strategies

Unfortunately, I have not been able to get into the fundamental site in NY 
but I am working on it.  I am sure a lot of this info is up there.

Subject: RE: industrials


what do the ally cutbacks mean in mcf per day
what is the impact of the integrated steel plants running at 70% of capacity
(number released weekly) mean to power demand and hence demand for nat gas
what is going on re. nat gas liquids being stripped out? i.e. dynegy and
mitchell etc. have all announced full or partial closures of stripping
facilities as economics aren't there.  someone shld be tracking what this
means in mcf per day
why won't utilities give you utilization of plants by fuel type, as they do
in nuclear, so you can track power demand by fuel type
how much nat gas demand is being lost cuz nat gas ethylene producers have
shut down as margins are too low vs. their naptha based competitors.  etc.
etc.
where do we stand on switching vs. resid, diesel etc. etc.


i could go on, but i think i've made my point; what is in the report is
good, but it's incomplete and not totaled with some summary conclusions.
it's only the very easy, first derivative demands/closures.  it could add
real value by looking for alternative data points that aren't as easily
tracked by the market.

D- not sure if we ever showed this to you- once a week we update all the
plant closures for ammonia, methanol, and aluminium smelters and the
resulting gas and power that's back on the market.  these pages are in back
of the weather.  please let me know what you think of these- elena, our
analyst in houston is always looking for feedback which is hard to get
because the report only circulates internally.

Most of you are aware that there are several projects on the table dealing 
with Gas Transportation Capacity information.  On Monday, the 25th,  Russell 
Long a Business Analyst with over 15 years of business and IT experience will 
be joining Enron and will be assigned to help get these projects jump started 
and provide coordination across the projects.  I'd like to get together on 
Tuesday the 26th to present and discuss the following:

High Level Combined Project Plan
Overall Project Coordination & Documentation
Individual Project Leads and Team Members
Major Issues and Questions

It is probably not critical that everyone be able to attend as I can follow 
follow up later with those that can't make the meeting and I want to get 
started ASAP.  In the mean time feel free to contact me if you have any 
questions.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

Cheryl:  Please set up the meeting referenced above and invite the people 
address on this memo.  At a minimum I'd like to have Hunter, Colleen, Bhavna, 
Colin, Scott, Dave, Chris Gaskill, Chris Hanz and Cade at the meeting.  I'd 
like to meet on Tuesday the 26th if possible.  Thanks!

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Subject: Lake Temp. Affect Theory

A fact is this summer the NE never got very hot.  Therefore the 
Great Lakes didn't heat up as much as normal. Argument is then that 
the cool fronts might be colder to the NE actual temps b/c of winds off 
the colder Lakes.  
Does the lake affect snow theory cover this or would this be the infamous
Shively Windchill Effect I used to hear so much about when on Central ??
May be the reverse will happen, please enlighten me if you know something...

It might be interesting to take a look at the historical water temps. of great
lakes historical vs current year, may be the Enron depth of research can 
investigate.

Here is the link, I haven't had the time to do it yet....

Technical issues

1) When some of the members of the chat room begin to talk, their microphone 
volume starts to trail off.

2) Many of the users use the ctrl button in their daily activities.  The talk 
button needs to be changed to an F# key.

3) We have trouble with latency.

Please contract Brent Tiner to help with these issues.

Thank You

Subject: Creation of Database for Capacity Release

The Electronic Commerce team is working with Marketing Operations and 
Commercial in development of the GISB Capacity Release EDI datasets.  One 
critical step in this process is creation of a database.

I would like to schedule a quick 30 minute meeting to discuss creation of 
this database and ensure all potential interfacing groups are in the loop.

 * Review Objectives
 * Determine best database   -   Oracle or Sybase
 * Set Priority for DA's

Currently, I have EB3013 scheduled for 2p.m. on Friday, July 14, 2000.  
Please let me know if you are not able to attend.

Thanks,

idea of what we will need.

Energy InfoDisc Release

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has released
its latest quarterly CD-ROM, Energy InfoDisc, which is now
a two (2) disc product. Energy InfoDisc is a comprehensive,
high-tech product that is easy to use, yet robust enough
for serious number crunching and analysis.  It provides
fast, easy, and inexpensive access to:

- Historical time series for production, consumption,
prices, and resource availability of conventional and
alternate energy resources

- Analyses of economic and technical topics

- Projections of future energy supply, demand, and prices
database applications that allow users to generate their
own individualized energy databases

On disc 1, users may view and search more than 400 data,
analysis, and forecasting reports and directories
published by EIA over the previous 12 months, including
the Monthly Energy Review, Short-Term Energy Outlook,
International Energy Outlook, and Country Analysis Briefs.
On disc 2, users may access EIA's extensive energy
database applications to generate their own individualized
energy databases.  Among the EIA database applications
contained on the Energy InfoDisc:

Annual Energy Outlook 2000
Electricity Databases
Oil and Gas Information System
Short-Term Energy Model
State Energy Data
U.S. Emissions of Greenhouse Gases
World Energy Database

Each new quarterly issue highlights new products and any
changes or enhancements to the CD. Energy InfoDisc contains
information on special industry topics such as the
restructuring of the electric power industry and greenhouse
gases and global warming.  Publications are displayed in
Portable Document Format (PDF). Most of the energy database
applications are written in Microsoft Access. The Microsoft
Access run-time engines required for these applications are
included.

Energy InfoDisc is issued quarterly. STAT-USA, a U.S.
Department of Commerce information service for business,
economic, and trade professionals, distributes EnergyInfoDisc,
through a cooperative agreement with EIA.  Orders can be
placed over STAT-USA's toll free order number: 1-800-STAT-USA
or by calling (202) 482-1986.  Energy InfoDisc can also be
purchased through the National Technical Information Service
(NTIS). NTIS is the federal government's central source for
the sale of scientific, technical, engineering, and related
business information produced by or for the U.S. government
and complementary material from international sources.  To
place an order by phone, call 1-800-553-NTIS (6847) or
(703) 605-6000.  To find out more about Energy InfoDisc and
