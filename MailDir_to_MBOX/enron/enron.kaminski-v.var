Jim,

1. I can confirm that CHARM does express traditional exposures in a VAR
format.  One of the beauties of CHARM is that it expresses any quantifiable
exposure in a VAR format, i.e. financial, insurance, weather risks.  In
addition, it has the capability of incorporating correlations between risks
- to the extent that they can be quantified.

2.  To get the ball rolling, I will send you a broschure of CHARM this
week. I also suggest a conference call with Carl Groth of our NY office.
Carl knows CHARM well and my thought is that we can give you some more
ideas of this product in order for you to decide whether or not you would
like to pursue a presentation. A presentation can be arranged at the
location of your choice.

Let me know if the above fits your purpose or if you would prefer to move
in another direction.

Regards,

Bertil

Dear all,

office.  Firstly we should say "thanks" to Andreas for being so helpful in=

establishing a solid working relationship with him going forward.

Find below a summary of Version_1a for initial rough calculation of MG=20

The current status of this effort and a plan for future progress is=20
summarized in the enclosed document:  =20

V@R methodology for MG Metals positions
Version_1a

Introduction
This document describes the initial rough model for calculations=20
Value-At-Risk for MG Metals. This model will be implemented in a spreadshee=
t,=20
which will serve as a prototype for the RiskTrac implementation.=20

Risk factors
The following positions represent most of MG Metal=01,s risk and will be co=
vered=20
by Version_1a:
- Base metals=01, positions including:
- aluminium;
- copper;
- gold;
- lead;
- nickel;
- silver;
- tin;
- zinc;
Risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward=20
prices for each metal.
- Copper concentrate;
Risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating TC charges=
.
- Cocoa beans;
Risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward=20
prices for cocoa beans.

Therefore these 10 curves will drive the risk: price curves for aluminium,=
=20
copper, gold, lead, nickel, silver, tin, zinc and cocoa beans plus tc curve=
=20
for copper concentrate.

Assumptions and simplifications:
- For each metal we are going to use a single price curve or all types of=
=20
products (physical, financial, LME traded, Comex traded, scrap, alloy, stoc=
k,=20
etc.);
- Delta, gamma approach for risk on options=01, positions;
=20
Components required to implement V@R model:=20
- current forward prices available from Mercur;
- current implied volatilities available through Reuters;
- current positions from Mercur;
- history of prices required to calculate factor loadings and correlations=
=20
across commodities;  =20

Methodology
Version_1a will be based on Risk Matrix approach. We will calculate princip=
al=20
components for each metal and cocoa beans to take in account the correlatio=
ns=20
along the term structure. We will also calculate the correlations across=20
commodities based on prompt month prices history for last 3 months.=20
=20
Portfolio hierarchy
Each position will be assigned to one of the following portfolios under the=
=20
whole portfolio AGG-METALS:
- MG Metal & Commodity Corp.
- MG Ltd.;
- MG Metal & Commodity Company Ltd.;
- MG Metall Recycling GmbH, Ffm;

Under each of these sub-portfolio there will be the following sub-portfolio=
s:
- Comex;
- Frame contract;
- LME;
- LME Alloy;
- LME Metal Index;
- Option Call;
- Option Put;
- Physical;
- Physical Alloy;
- Physical Real;
- Physical Scrap;
- Price Part.;
- Prov. Billing;
- Stock;
- Stock Alloy;
- Stock Comex;
- Stock Physical;
- Stock Scrap;

Thank you for the information. I agree that we need to talk about more what 
and how Global Valuation can facilitate a more competitive VAR engine. 
Winston and Nilay are going to give my group a presentation regarding the 
current VAR system next Tuesday. I am sure the presentation will help my team 
better understand the requirements of VAR engine on Global Valuation. Please 
join us if you have the time. I would also appreciate your insight on this

Subject: Re: real time VAR  

Ziyong,
we met with Nilay and Winston last week regarding real time VAR calculation 
possibility.

Winston has an overview of VAR System which consists of:
- Main Curves Simulation;
- Curve Server;
- Book Server;
- ID Server
- Clients

As a first step I want to see where the time is spent when VAR runs, which 
percentages of time are spent by each part.
Nilay is going to get this information for a few portfolios (AGG-ECT, AGG-GAS 
and NG-PRICE-PRC).
Preliminary information: currently VAR run takes about 1 hour, half of this 
time taken by "Book Server" 
(we have about 4500 lower level portfolios in the portfolio hierarchy, about 
5500 portfolios all together), 
most of the rest is taken by "Clients", "Main Curves Simulation" does not 
take much time.

I am looking also at using alternative methods of faster VAR calculation, but 
having so many portfolios in the hierarchy will slow down
even analytical VAR.

We also have to think more about what "real time"  calculation means and what 
it should produce.

Tanya

Dear all,

As promised, I cleaned up the data and put it into 6 spreadsheet files (we 
will do Gold and cocoa separately).  I also ran 10, 20, 30 and 60 day fwd fwd 
volatility calculations based on historical log return data - you can see the 
results at the bottom of the sheet called "Log Returns" for each of the six 
spreadsheets attached below.

The data in the files is ready for PCA analysis.  We can use either the fwd 
fwd vols from recent history or implied option quotes to complete the 
analysis.

Regards,

Anjam

P.S. We have already done the PCA on ALUMINUM H (high grade, so please don't 
repeat the analysis for that one)

FINAL FILES:

Jaesoo,
as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please,
implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves 
the following:

1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want 
to use
and which Enron's curves belong to each region.
2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each 
region. This decision can 
be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might 
be other considerations.
3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core 
curve.

Winston,
can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo 
with clustering done by SAS?
Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this? 

Tanya.

Also, I talked to Tanya about visiting MG in New York. She is leaving for

I think that it makes a lot of sense for her to visit MG and to kick

Vince/John,
Below is a brief summary of near-term projects for the enhancement of VAR and 
the use of VAR.  As you can tell some are not directly Research issues (some 
require the guidance but not direct work product), and are very North 
American Wholesale-centric.    
Vince,
I think that the only one in which progress requires your input to get kick 
started is #5.  All others are in progress with Tanya/Grant involved through 
Jeff Shankman's regular meeting.
We would like to get your input as to your priorities (we were thinking Top 
5?) and then start knocking some of them out.  It is not meant to be 
exhaustive and is focused on fixes as opposed to overhauls. 
Thanks

Rick,
This is my initial attempt to summarize our meeting with John.  The next 
steps would be to solicit feedback from other interested parties and scope 
the resources and responsibilities.
Ted

Rick Buy, John Lavorato and I met to discuss priorities as it relates to the 
calculation of VAR.  We are making the following recommendations

 1) Inclusion of monthly index positions into VAR calculations as the 
indicies set in North American Natural Gas
 2) Development of a methodology to re-run correlations (factor loadings) 
including criteria, responsibilities and acceptance/rejection criteria
 3) Development of process by which to analyze the output of factor loading 
process.  Database to store output and management reports.
 4) Finalize debate on the calculation of Forward/Forward volatility
 5) Scope a project to analyze the possibility of calculating hourly 
volatility for power.

It was further recommended that we continue to not include unpriced index 
positions in VAR calculation.

Hi,
I have run the VaR for COB 1st Aug 2000. A summary of the results is as 
follows :




I have also attached the model.

Again the prices for Cocoa Beans and Gold have not been updated since the 
26th July. The gamma positions for the metals have been 
added to check the effect on the VaR. The change  was small :
Delta VaR - $4,899,196
Delta/Gamma VaR - $4,780,797
This is not a live daily feed as Andreas mannually created the file for me 
today so that we could do this check.

Subject: VaR

John,

We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues.
The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26
where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good
candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.

It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR 
system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative 
basis,
jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.
This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a 
big
jump in VaR.
This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look
at column D.

The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:

 a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the
                     code to review it.

 b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in
                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can 
propose, is to develop for
                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to 
review the fwd vol curve
                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  
it can be smoothed.

Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?


Vince

Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of 
"analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as 
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to 
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested 
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

Tanya

Frank, 
regarding simulating power prices in VAR we might discuss the following items
and show some results:
1. Clustering for power:
	- clustering based on historical prices and correlations from them;
	- geographical clustering;
	- flexibility in choosing "core curves" (based on position size);
2. Jump-diffusion process for intramonth and prompt month:
	- parameter estimation from historical data (do we want to use it?)
	- working out parameters (jumps frequency, jump size) as stress scenarios;
3. Correlations within a cluster and across clusters.
4. Changing correlations estimations (using fixed contact' time series).
5. Joint estimation of factors for selected regions.

Let me know what you think should be in the agenda for this meeting.

Regards,

Tanya

Naveen,
attached spreadsheet contains the factors for US power curves calculated
based on 9/28/00-11/28/00 data in stage with the latest version of vatrfacs.
By specifying integer number from 1 to 32 in cell J1 you can see the factors 
for different regions.
I suggest to consider the following sets of factors as acceptable:
R1A, R1E,R2,R2A,R2B,R3,R3A,R3B,R4,R4C,R5,R5A,R6,R7,R7A,R8,R9.

Please review and confirm.

Tanya,
          We have checked the RiskTrac system and
(1) The spreadoption, and other,  mappings in Risktrac are correct.  ie, 
E1S1B has both power(PPP) and gas(NBP) and the deltas/gammas tie out.  The 
LOLP and SMP mappings all tie out.
(2) However, the UK power in Risktrac has 25TWH more of Power.  This has 
something to do with the Enpower-Risktrac communication.
(3) UK-Gas positions tie out in aggregate (off by a single BcF)

For VaR discrepancies, other than positions, the following will contrbute
(1) In Risktrac power is mapped to R4 (Cinergy) while in the spreadsheet it 
is US-NG.
(2) Gas-Power and EFA-EFA correlations are different.

Matthew is coordinating with Oliver and London IT to resolve the position 
issues.

Subject: Re: UK portfolios and books setup in RisktRac  

Naveen and Matthew,
I started looking systematically through UK positions and corresponding VAR 
numbers in the RisckRac.
I found a few inconsistencies so far.

1. The portfolio E1SB1-NBP has a book E1SB1 under it.  The sum of delta 
positions for this book is 
239,021,655, the sum of gamma positions is -211,031,450. VAR for the 
portfolio E1SB1-NBP is zero.

The same refers to a few other portfolios, for example E1SB2-NBP, E1SB3-NBP, 
E2XX1-NBP.

2. The portfolio E1SBP1-PPP also has the book E1SB1 under it. This book 
contains the positions on PPPWD1
through PPPWD6 and PPPWE1 through PPPWE4. 

The same refers to the other books, for example E1SB2.

This looks messy.  Can someone in RAC go over all the portfolios, all the 
corresponding books and curves
in RisktRac and make sure they are set up properly?

Thank you,

Tanya.

Vince-

It seems like we should be able use MG's V@R methodology as version 1.a if 
the credit component is eliminated and the hold period is conformed to our 
one day interval.  Could we do this and achieve an approximation of where you 
want to be with the completion of Anjam and Tamara's work?  When submitting a 
request for Interim Metals Trading Policy to Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling, I'd 
very much like to represent that, while our methodology may be imperfect, we 
have ways + means of tracking V@R right now that will be upgraded to Enron 
standards in very short order.  Thoughts?

Dear all,

Please ensure that all requests for metals Research support in London are 
directed/forwarded to me in the first instance (e.g. option pricing, VaR).  
This is to ensure speediest response time and to avoid duplication of effort 
as well as confusion on the part of our MG counterparts due to multiple 
(duplicated) requests for information.

Tanya and I are currently developing version 1a of the VaR models for MG 
Metals.  Vince, Ted and MG Metals are looking to Tanya and I to provide 
leadership in this area for the integration effort and after production of 
VaR v.1a, I will look to pass on responsibility for MG Metals VaR systems 
integration to Kirstee Hewitt for the London side.

Regards,

Anjam Ahmad

Hi - I have run the model for the 26th and have the following results :



I have also updated the correlations to include silver and the gold.
The TC delta (treatment charges) are positions only for copper conentrate and 
do not 
contain any positions due to zinc or lead.
Could you take a look at the figues as this is the first time I have done a 
full run and 
would like to make sure that I have done things correctly.
I will definitely call to discuss the prices for gold and cocoa beans - the 
TC price curve is 
another issue however, at the moment we do not have anything other than a 
spot price and 
a 1 year price so I think we will probably have to set it as a constant.
I have to talk to Andreas soon as he is awaiting my comments on point (2) of 
his email that 
I forwarded in my last mail. 
Also, you will can see that I have subtracted any positions that are from R 
Wolf in the Mercur download - 
this was point (1) of his note.
As a quick question?
Do you think it is worth including Zinc concentrate (18400 dmt) and lead 
concentrate (920 dmt) ?
I think we may need to check the TC price for these and the conversion for 
the one given in the model for copper as 
I think that the original historical price file (TChistory) is quoted in c/lb 
- I guess this is cents/pound? rather 
than $/dmt which is the units that position is quoted in .
 
Speak to you soon
Kirstee

The same is true of aluminum. I assume this is the position change.

As I have suspected the position as of 6/30 vs 7/19 makes the difference. The 
first table first column is my VAR number with 6/30 position and gold&silver

gold&silver prices. The second table first column is my VAR with 7/19 
position and 6/30 gold&silver prices, the second column is as before.

I would ask you to plug the gold and silver prices and see what kind of

MODELVAR2000.xls that I have sent you for gold & silver prices and

Subject: VaR numbers for the 26th

Hi Andreas,

I have run the VaR model for the 26th July and have attached a zip file of 
the results:

The total VaR is $4,170,653 and the Cu position is $1,852,876.


I have had trouble getting hold of you so I thought I would summarised what I 
wanted to talk about (also I thought 
I would give your ears a rest!)
Basically it is wrt the second point in your mail yesterday (we briefly 
discussed it earlier). 
The fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use a 
5 day period of adjustment to calculate 
the risk (in this case it is called Capital at Risk). The VaR calculation for 
our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factor
will be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt(5) or 2.24. 
Since :

Old risk factor (%) =  1.65*(std of the price movement) = 3.99%
 
New daily risk factor = 3.99/2.24  = 1.78%    which actually equates to std 
of approx 1.1% a day.
I am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we 
are showing for Cu is approx 19% which equates to approx 1.2% daily.

Using this new risk factor for the daily VaR the Cu positions would give a 
VaR (for the 19th) of approx $2m which is less that the 
figure we estimated ($3,100,568).
The other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term 
structure of the price curve/vol curve and position 
curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means 
that it is difficult to compare the numbers.
I hope that this helps to explain our number.

Hopefully we can talk tomorrow,
Cheers
Kirstee

Tariff VAR Project Kick-off Meeting

Time: 8/3; 2-3 pm
Location: EB612

==============================================================================
=============
Per the 8/2 lunch meeting between Research, RAC, and the Tariff Group, there 
developed a consensus to:

Develop a high level Value-at-Risk model within a 4-8 week time frame to use 
for initial risk measurement and hedging purposes
Accommodate links for critical variables such as Interest Rates, Load Growth, 
and inflation
Provide "knobs" for less quantifiable factors such as rate case frequency, 
rate methodology, etc.
Collaborate with the tariff forecasting team, to have consistent assumptions 
and logic.

Proposed agenda for our meeting:

Hi Kirstee,

Thanks again for all your work on MG. One think to double check is units.
Please, make sure that the prices are quoted in the same units our positions 
come in.

One potential source of confusion arises from the fact that we are dealing 
with different
cultures (metric system vs. English measures).

Subject: VaR for COB 2nd Aug 2000

Hi Vince,
I was waiting for a comment about the email below before sending it to the 
full mailing list. Basically it suggests that the 
copper option position may well have increased the VaR by more than $500,000. 
However, given that the portfoilo has also 
changed from the 1st of August it is difficult to asses the actual change due 
to the option only.

Subject: VaR for COB 2nd Aug 2000

Hi all,
The CU option position has entered the MG books for the 2nd Aug. The delta is 
35299$/mt for Dec 2000. The Cu VaR has gone up 
from $2,245,000 to $3,306,000. I estimated that the portfolio for the 1st 
would increase to approx $3,039,000 so this seems sensible. 
The overall VaR change is from $4,780,796 to $5,991,569. Again, the estimate 
for the 1st Aug was for an increase in VaR to ~ $5,476,000.
All estimates were based on a delta of 32,0004/dmt.
There has also been some increase in the VaR for Aluminium which will effect 
the overall total.
A summary is as follows :






 
regards,
Kirstee

Thanks for the update - especially your point 3 which echoes our own discussion yesterday: I want to clarify responsibilities for maintenance and administration of VAR. 
We need transparency around the process so that mapping decisions, for example, are easily made, supported and reviewed. 

It became clear after last Friday's events, that we are in an awkward paradigm with respect to how we handle VAR here, particularly at "pressure points".

I am putting together the scope of a "general overhaul" of the VAR process, including method and administration, to which I hope we would all buy in, so be assured of our co-operation.

David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

Everybody,

this week our regular meeting will be devoted primarily to 2 subjects:
1. Simulating power prices in VAR;
2. Capturing correlations across commodities as well as across term structure 
of
forward prices.

Research will present some suggestions based on data analysis.

Detailed agenda is enclosed.

Please, let Shirley Crenshaw know if you are not planning to attend.

Tanya.

Vlady, I enclosed the file with 2 backtesting plots (you saw them before).

The following table shows what was the percentage of the days when PnL fell 
below VAR95, VAR90, VAR85. 
These results are based on the real NG forward prices from 1/1/99 to 6/7/00 
for 2 different portfolios:
-Portfolio 1 contained the positions equal to NG-PRICE-PRC portfolio 
positions on 6/6/00, 
-Portfolio 2 consists of the positions equal to STORAGE-PRC positions on 
5/25/00.

_____________________________________________________________________
Portfolio 1
     VAR95  VAR90  VAR85  
Implied Vols    2.93  4.11  5.57
Historical vols with Decay=1  7.62  12.02  15.54
Historical vols withDecay=0.97  6.75  12.02  15.54
Historical vols withDecay=0.94  6.45  12.02  15.54
_____________________________________________________________________
Portfolio 2
     VAR95  VAR90  VAR85  
Implied Vols    4.1  6.74  9.97
Historical vols with Decay=1  7.04  11.14  15.84
Historical vols withDecay=0.97  6.74  10.56  16.13
Historical vols withDecay=0.94  7.04  11.14  15.84
____________________________________________________________________
This shows that when we have more observations (columns corresponding to 
VAR90 and VAR85)
compared to the column corresponding to VAR95 the frequency of Curve Shift 
being lower than VAR
becomes closer to the theoretical value (5%, 10% and 15%). The numbers in the 
column "VAR85" are 
very close to 15%. This is the argument in favor of using historical vols. 
And also the results do not depend on the decay factor in this experiment.

Also notice: the numbers in column "VAR95" are higher than 5% and this is an 
indication of fat tails.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Tanya.

      (Document link: Vince J Kaminski)

Naveen,
the "analytical VAR" approach is working for Equity portfolio.
It gives us the tool to examine the tails' behavior for this portfolio and
calculate "Expected Tail Loss".
The same should be done for commodities portfolio as well.

Meanwhile, as we discussed, we can give some rough estimates of the losses
corresponding to percentiles other than 5th.

Look at the figure below. You can see VAR numbers for 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
calculated with
1) simulations (100 thousand simulations);
2) analytical VAR (gamma-delta positions representation)

     1) and 2) are very close because there are not many options in Equity
portfolio.

3) simulations (1000 simulations) to calculate 5% VAR. Then in order to
approximately estimate VAR for 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
I scaled 5% VAR with factors corresponding to normal distribution (for
example: Norminv(0.001,0,1)/Norminv(0.05,0,1) for 0.1%).
The result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good (just 5%
different from the correct number).
We probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio
until we have proper methods implemented.

Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of
"analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

Tanya

Tanya,
        While there is seasonal correlations in power, especially for Np-15 
and SP-15 (same region), the term structure of correlations can be input.  
However, the same correlation structure with similar periodicity may not hold 
between Np-15 and, say, R1B (Neepool), though one would imagine that  
relationship would still be seasonal (summer/winter), with greater noise.  
Even if the correlational term structure is to be done for Power, different 
rules would have to be inputted for different regions.
Naveen

Subject: Re: implementing term-structure of correlations for power  

Vlady & Naveen,
I am sending you the factor loadings for power calculated based on the prices 
from 25-jun-00 to 25-sep-00. They look rather messy. 


Thus joint estimation of factors for a few regions does not look realistic.

Instead we might implement the term structure of correlations. 
Instead of heaving 1 correlation matrix based on prompt month prices and 
applying this matrix to all maturities,
we can have a number correlation matrices each corresponding to a particular 
prompt month.
I attached the term structure of correlations between R10 and R11 calculated 
using 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 months
of historical forward prices prior to 30-sep-00 with and without decay factor.

You can see that:
1)  the results are close for 5, 4, and 3 months of history;
2) correlations are periodic with a period of 1 year (this means we can use 
12 correlation matrices calculated from 
first 12 forward contracts and apply these matrices to other forward months);
3) Using decay factor makes the curves a little smoother.

Implementation of multiple correlation matrices will not affect the speed of 
calculations in VAR model significantly.

Please, give me your response,

Thanks,

Tanya.

Tanya,

As we discussed in the last meeting, to simulate secondary power curve we 
need correlated jump sizes. This is totally different from the current 
secondary price curve simulation which assume the perfect correlation and 
also totally different from the secondary GAS basis curve simulation which is 
based on the hedging ratio.

There are two more issues on my side I need to resolve:
1. I want resolve the power basis curve issue.  Currently all power position 
on these basis curve are actually price positions.  We are hard coding this: 
if power basis we add basis to corresponding region curve.  I am trying to 
remove this hard coding by asking loading the price curve for all these basis 
locations.

2. Same is true for all those Power F curves.  These curves looks similar to 
those basis curves.  Currently we just directly map these F curves to the 
corresponding region curves.  I would also prefer to load the price curves 
instead of the price differences.

>From research, I need those jump size correlations.

Clearly, all these involve many new development, unless we want to use 
simpler way to simulate secondary power curves.

Regards,

Winston

Jaesoo,
as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please,
implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves 
the following:

1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want 
to use
and which Enron's curves belong to each region.
2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each 
region. This decision can 
be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might 
be other considerations.
3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core 
curve.

Winston,
can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo 
with clustering done by SAS?
Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this? 

Tanya.

Dear Andreas,

Thanks for the very useful response and information on positions.  I have 
handed over primary responsibility for metals VaR to Kirstee Hewitt (at least 
as far as London is concerned) and she will follow up on the points you 
kindly reported, although I am of course available to assist where 
necessary.  Tanya will remain the point of contact for VaR modelling in 
Houston, and of course Kirstee and Tanya will work together on this to 
resolve these and further issues.  I would be happy to help set up meetings 
for you in the London office when you visit next week, with Kirstee, myself 
and anyone else that you would like to meet with and we very much look 
forward to your visit - please let me know if you need any help with the 
arrangements.

Regards,

Anjam

Anjam,
thanks for your VAR Model.
I would like to point out the following:
1) Position data: I noted that the outright (longs + Shorts) for copper
include positions which we should not use, i.e. R. Wolff quantities. This
positions are imputed into the system at their integrity (some legs/hedges
are missing)
This affects copper and Lead position for now. The issues should be have
been sorted out by the end of this month, ie next week. So in Copper you
have 25,487 mt to much and with Lead you have 13,579mt to much.(as of June
19)

2) Looking at copper position you calculate a VAR of -3,100,568 with a
total outright of 63.765 mt.
This seams too low. if I calculate 63765 x 1807 x3.99%=4.218 mil. US$. VAR
(outright qty x price levelx risk factor, riskfactr as per Mercur).
In my view we have been understating VaR in Mercur because we do not
consider the spread position correctly (i.e. in detail). On a position like
that I would expect a figure of around 6 mil US$.
I guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period.

3) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as
many fields are blank.

Lets talk tomorrow on the phone.

Attached please find the Position summary for the last week #30 (since June
19) as requested by Kirstee.

Hi Andreas,

This is the semi-final spreadsheet - have only to include price curves for
Gold and cocoa.  Kirstee and I would welcome your comments.

Frank,
our VAR team has been looking at different ways to implement clustering and 
jumps for power prices simulation
in VAR.
I attached the suggestion we came up with and the results of clustering and 
jump parameters estimation.
Would you like to discuss this methodology? We need your input.

Please, let me know,

Thank you,

Naveen,
the "analytical VAR" approach is working for Equity portfolio. 
It gives us the tool to examine the tails' behavior for this portfolio and 
calculate "Expected Tail Loss".
The same should be done for commodities portfolio as well.

Meanwhile, as we discussed, we can give some rough estimates of the losses 
corresponding to percentiles other than 5th.

Look at the figure below. You can see VAR numbers for 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1% 
calculated with 
1) simulations (100 thousand simulations);
2) analytical VAR (gamma-delta positions representation)

 1) and 2) are very close because there are not many options in Equity 
portfolio.

3) simulations (1000 simulations) to calculate 5% VAR. Then in order to 
approximately estimate VAR for 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
I scaled 5% VAR with factors corresponding to normal distribution (for 
example: Norminv(0.001,0,1)/Norminv(0.05,0,1) for 0.1%).
The result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good (just 5% 
different from the correct number). 
We probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio 
until we have proper methods implemented.

Subject: Re: "analytical" var implementation in RisktRAC  

Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of 
"analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as 
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to 
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested 
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

Tanya

I know nothing about this.  Since neither Research nor EnergyDesk know about 
it, all we can do is collect their requirements and provide what they're 
looking for as a new project.  This will require Vince's input since we'll 
essentially be sending Research models to the outside world.

 Per our conversation, here is the model that I have for Simon.  The notes 
that I gave you were from some work I did back in September as I was looking 
for volume numbers.  The notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers.

 Briefly, the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and 
noncredit risk.   Ideally, this would be anything that effects NPV of the 
deal.  However, I think that we should limit ourselves to those things that 
effect the time and amount of the EAM volumes.  Even here, such a problem set 
is quite large.  If you glance at the spreadsheet model, you will notice that 
there exists a large number of possible items that effect the EAM volumes.  
If we are to do this rigorously, then it is necessary to tear apart EES's 
business model, and although such an attempt to do so would be noble, the 
scope of such an excercise may be too large.  We need a clear definition of 
EES Operational Risk.

 Briefly, from the EES deals that I have looked at, two things drive their 
profit:  a long term bet that power prices will go down, and that we can 
improve the facility through various enhancements.  Each of these may be 
gleaned from the spreadsheet, as well as the assumptions regarding the 
funding of the facility improvements and so on.  95% of the savings is 
assumed to come from power, and 5% from gas.  (The effeciency gain may not be 
explicitly given).  If we have data that show the realized efficiency gains, 
then it would be simple [in principle] to determine a distribution, and hence 
a distribution of EAM volumes, NPV's, etc.  At this time, I understand that 
RAC has determined some of the realized efficiency gains, but my knowledge is 
quite sketchy.  Jay Hachen may have more info.

 If I get a chance, I will try to see if I can do a "proof of concept" 
excercise, but I have a late January deadline on something else.

 Another point:  even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet 
model, EES has chosen to book things differently.  I do not have a thorough 
understanding of their IT systems, but at least in principle, if we can do 
this for the spreadsheet model, then we can do it in their IT environment 
(data are data are data).  They may book efficiency gains through improvement 
type, such as gains due to compressors, chillers, boilers, etc.  If this is 
indeed the case, then we need to have distributions for each type of 
improvement.   

 If we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their IT 
systems, then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system.  It 
would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by Excel 
workbooks.  It can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run 
simulations and queries, but this would probably take me about five or six 
weeks.

 Finally, Don Hawkins does Operational Audits for Enron's physical assets.  
He sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets.  I don't 
think that he does it for EES, but you might want to give him a call anyway.

-Kevin K.

PS:  The EES lunch meeting has been moved to Wednesdays.  Jay Hachen will 
know more.

Ted,

We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions. Many 
thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead
in this effort. We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to 
validate some  inputs
before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both 
London and Houston work
with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.

A few comments.

1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston 
(Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs.
The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to 
multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee,
please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).

2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated 
positions and prices on a regular basis.

3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:

 a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its 
portfolios. This is the liquidity risk
       resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the 
underlying positions.
 b.  We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating 
the position numbers (i.e. look
                      into the details of specific transactions).  From what 
I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk
       management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option 
prices (and deltas). They get some
                      option prices by calling brokers.

4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the 
inputs are right). But, as I have said,
     VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.

Grant & Vince,
I am sending you the results of fitting different price process models into NG
prompt month prices. The fit is quite good for some models.
We might think of using these mean-reverting jump-diffusion models in our 
Credit Model. 

I should examine other contracts behavior (beyond prompt month) as well.

Subject: Re: clustering for power  

Jaesoo,
as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please,
implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves 
the following:

1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want 
to use
and which Enron's curves belong to each region.
2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each 
region. This decision can 
be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might 
be other considerations.
3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core 
curve.

Winston,
can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo 
with clustering done by SAS?
Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this? 

Tanya.

vincent,

We are capturing vega everyday now, but limited validation on the vega is 
down!  I think we need to coordinate with Debbie and Rudi on this one.

The vega Var will be implemented soon, I am wondering whether we capture all 
the vega position in the database now?
Thanks,

Naveen,
I was trying to find "fat tails". I looked at NG prompt month prices' 
log-returns for 5 years  9 months.
On the figure below you can see the comparison of empirical cumulative 
probability function with normal 
cumulative for this time series (standardized: mean subtracted, divided by 
stdev). The effect of fat tails
is not pronounced so much. The "fat tails" effect was much more visible on 
your plot when you looked at the 
oct-00 prices log-returns versus my time series of prompt month's prices.
The shape of the distribution is different from normal, though, and fits well 
with the volatility switching model.

Tanya.

I here you are running abook on how quickly we can implement Convolution VaR for power and since I am up against a summer deadline for this I felt I should take the other side.

So how about I buy you dinner if I get it done ?

The books were set up incorrectly when the spreadsheet feeds were 
implemented. This has since been corrected. Currently the European risk trac 
numbers do not feed into the corporate reporting of VaR.

The books should now contain gas exposures in UK gas and Power in UK power 
and have no duplication.

I have previously discussed with Naveen and  Kirstee that it would be a good 
idea if we set up a regular meeting to projecct manage the implementation of 
European VaR numbers, from risk trac, into the daily reporting. If you have 
no objections I suggest we discuss this at the next weekly RAC/Research 
meeting.

namely: some books (for example E1SB1 and E1SB2) belong to UK-GAS portfolio 
and to UK-POWER portfolio.
I wanted to clarify this in order to reconcile positions in RisktRac and in

Subject: Re: UK portfolios and books setup in RisktRac  

Naveen and Matthew,
I started looking systematically through UK positions and corresponding VAR 
numbers in the RisckRac.
I found a few inconsistencies so far.

1. The portfolio E1SB1-NBP has a book E1SB1 under it.  The sum of delta 
positions for this book is 
239,021,655, the sum of gamma positions is -211,031,450. VAR for the 
portfolio E1SB1-NBP is zero.

The same refers to a few other portfolios, for example E1SB2-NBP, E1SB3-NBP, 
E2XX1-NBP.

2. The portfolio E1SBP1-PPP also has the book E1SB1 under it. This book 
contains the positions on PPPWD1
through PPPWD6 and PPPWE1 through PPPWE4. 

The same refers to the other books, for example E1SB2.

This looks messy.  Can someone in RAC go over all the portfolios, all the 
corresponding books and curves
in RisktRac and make sure they are set up properly?

Thank you,

Tanya.

David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery 
is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the 
problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can 
increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will 
investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity 
should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense 
to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less 
transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be 
systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the 
trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the 
responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

Vince

Gentlemen,

Below is a plan of action for moving along with the VaR methodology change 
related to forward-forward volatility:

1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk)

 - determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs. 
correlations (20 days vs. 60 days)
 - stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does 
not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%

2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the 
memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff



3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment 
(Research/IT)

4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)

5. Migrate into production (Research/IT)

Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations. 
Vlady.

are stored in our database. In the enclosed file you'll find the list of 
columns for 4 tables and
2 quarries as an example. 3 of these tables contain the positions

I agree. This would happen when there is an insufficient pipeline capacity
to move gas. The market developments you describe happen quite
often and this is one of the reasons we want to have the model you are working

Vince-

I forgot to mention to you one other development I propose, a theory I call 
"uncoupling" of basis. As an example, severe cold weather specific to the 
Midwest can result in an elevation of spot market prices at Henry Hub, where 
prices elsewhere in the Northeast are such that the basis appears to be less 
than the commodity charge to ship gas from Louisiana to the Northeast. This 
can happen when gas is not being moved in the spot market from Louisiana to 
the Northeast at that time.  The notion of "equilibrium" cannot, in my view, 
always assume "spot" gas is flowing along all nodes of the network.

Hi Tanya,

I think using the 60 business day fwd fwd vols based on historical data is 
reasonable, to ensure consistency with the amount of data we use to estimate 
the eigenvalues.  I am just finishing the correlations study.

Hi,
I have run the VaR with updated factor loadings for the gold,silver and cocoa 
bean positions. The biggest change in VaR from 
adding this information has been to the Cocoa bean position which has 
increased from approx $45,900 to $506,553.
The overal VaR has not changed by very much as the position file I was sent 
from Andreas had not changed from the 26th - I 
have queried this and it will not be a problem to re-run the numbers on 
Monday if I recieve a further file.
The VaR summary for all the metals is as follows :





Also, after having a conversation with Bjorn about stress/scenario analysis I 
thought I might quickly try to set up a few scenarios to 
see how sensitive the VaR is to a position change in Aluminium, Nickel and 
Copper.
I have only applied position increases (thge direction of the shifts are 
dependent on the monthly outright position direction) up until Dec2000.
The shifts and results are given in the following attached spreadsheet.  


It is interesting that the individual VaR's are particuarly sensitive to 
increasing the position for Nickel.
I would like to discuss these results on Monday and any further suggestions 
for senarios would also be gratefully recieved.

Have a good weekend,
Kirstee.

Subject: Factor Loadings

I hope that the following clears up some of the  confusion regarding the 
above-captioned process.

Factor loadings are an input to Value-at-Risk (VAR).  Generally, you can 
consider them the determinants of relationships between curves,and points on 
curves based on trader inputs.   These pertain to all curves not just North 
American Natural Gas.  There is a specific program which calculates these 
relationships which requires a considerable amount of processing time (3 
hours per run) as well as another few man-days to evaluate the results.  

There is no "ideal" or recommended period in which these must be updated.  
More frequent is "better".  Given the amount of time it takes to refresh, it 
was "agreed" a long time ago amongst  RAC, Research, IT and Operations that 
it would be done every 2 weeks.  No commercial input was received.  The roles 
were to be simple as they are with most roles in and around VAR and other 
risk management controls: 

 Research specifies the math
 IT codes the program
 Operations runs the program
 RAC evaluates the results 

The process has been run every two weeks on the second Thursday of every 
month since February (as it had been prior) and RAC has rejected the results 
because the results did not reflect the underlying math because of the 
complexity of the math and the continuing addition of new products and 
curves.  This  created the need to recode the application from scratch.   RAC 
continued to agitate to get this done, particularly knowing that the pressure 
on the efficacy of VAR would be questioned as we went into the volatile 
period of 2000 ( e-mails from Rudi Zipter available upon request).  The new 
code was implemented last Thursday and the results were accepted resulting in 
an approximate 10% difference in VAR.

RAC had requested that the code be re-written on 6/10/99 @ 7:44 am with a 
target completion date of  8/2/99.  This was discussed and accepted by 
Phillipe Bibi on 6/17/99 in a meeting in his conference room with Rick Buy, 
Dan Bruce, Jonathon Le, Ted Murphy, Bill Bradford, Debbie Brackett and Rudi 
Zipter along with the rest of our task list.  

We have resolved that the process will continue as stated and will 
communicate to you the results. 

There are dozens of other processes that are important to the calculation and 
interpretation of VAR that need to be implemented, enhanced, improved or 
rewritten altogether.  For example, the jump-diffusion factors for North 
American Power have not been refreshed in 2000.  The prioirty is dependent on 
the level of precision required. 

I will provide a comprehensive list of those processes in due course.

Tanya,

Some stability tests were performed on the simulation.
(1) The Window size of the averaging in the simulation was changed from 10 to 
20 for NG-PRICE(the biggest book in gas) for effective date June-28 .  As you 
can see in the file 28NG-Price_Windowsize, the Component VaR numbers are very 
similar. 

(2)  To look at a calculational comparison, I looked at the STORAGE-PRC book 
(which has no gamma position) for effective date of 27th and (a) calculated 
FFVols, and (b)calculated the RiskMetrics VaR (the correlations are very high 
across the term structure) and compared to the Component Var code 
calculation, and again the two nubers are comparable, given the different 
modes of calculation.

Thanks - based on a "speed read" it would appear that SRM sits neatly in the 
volumetric part of your framework. Regarding systems I am keen to preserve 
the work Kevin has already done and I suspect we can eventually use the 
visualization tools in the RisktRAC front end to display the results should 
we require.

To be honest, I feel a good deal more comfortable that there is already a 
framework and initiative in place - its very easy to feel like the "angry 
lone voice" in an effort like this - fortunately the practitioners of the art 
of risk management generally travel in a similar direction !

I shall make sure our efforts remain in congruence.

Vince,
Sorry for getting back a little late. I have been in touch with Kirstee to 
figure out how to treat positions data which is the primary cause for 
fluctuations. Apparently, as of 7/19, MG still has July position. This may be 
spot or balance of the month, or some settlement issue. This indeed is what 
we are trying to find out/verify (it may be an error too). Kirstee is going 
to get back to me on this. If it is not an error, then Anjam's latest results 
($5.5 million total VAR) are reasonable given all the assumptions and the 
missing pieces. I will keep you posted.

As I have suspected the position as of 6/30 vs 7/19 makes the difference. The

I would ask you to plug the gold and silver prices and see what kind of

Vince, 
UK VAR breached the limit last week.
UK traders asked us to review the correlations across UK gas and power as 
well as the correlations across EFA slots.
We did part of the work last week.
Now we'll update the correlations based on historical prices.

Subject: Re: VaR correlation scenarios  

Thanks Tanya, these are interesting results.  I am on vacation next week, so 
here are my current thoughts.  I am contactable on my mobile if necessary.

Gas to power correlations
 I see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting VAR for the 
combined gas and power portfolio, and this raises an interesting point:  At a 
conservative 30% long term correlation, combined VAR is o1mm less than 
previously expected - so how does this affect the limit breach?  Strictly 
speaking, we are still over our UK power limit, but the limit was set when we 
were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR.  

A suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the UK 
Gas and Power books- 
can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in 
portfolio VAR  - ie [Reduction = Portfolio VAR - sum(Power VAR + Gas VAR)]?

Also, if I understand your mail correctly, Matrix 1 implies 55% gas power 
correlation is consistent with our correlation curves, and this reduces total 
VAR by o1.8mm.

EFA slot correlations
The issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct is 
a separate issue.  I don't understand where the Matrix 2 EFA to EFA 
correlations come from, but I am happy for you to run some historical 
correlations from the forward curves (use the first 2 years, I would 
suggest).  Our original matrix was based on historicals, but the analysis is 
worth doing again.  Your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important 
these correlations are.

Closing thoughts
Friday's trading left us longer so I would not expect a limit breach on 
Monday.  We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve, and I'd 
like to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office (Monday 
week) before finalising this.
 
Regards

Richard

Subject: Re: VaR correlation scenarios  

Everybody,
Oliver  sent us the VAR number for different correlations for UK-Power 
portfolio separately from UK-Gas portfolio.

First, if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gas 
curves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas, only 
the aggregate number will be affected. The changes you see are due to the 
fact that we use Monte-Carlo simulation method,
which accuracy depends on the number of simulations. Even if we don't change 
the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers,
we get slightly different result from the model.

So: to see the effect of using different correlations between Gas and Power 
we should look at the aggregate number.

I calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves I got from Paul. As the 
weights along the term structure I used the product of price, position and 
volatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots. The results 
are shown below:


Inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced 
negatively definite correlation matrix, which brakes VAR engine. 
Correlation matrix for any set of random variables is non-negative by 
definition, and remains non-negatively definite if calculated properly based 
on any historical data.
Here, according to our phone discussion, we started experimenting with 
correlations, assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elec 
versus Gas. I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results. In 
addition to the aggregate VAR numbers for the runs Oliver did, you can see 
the VAR numbers based on correlation Matrix 1 and Matrix 2. In Matrix 1 the 
correlations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix.
I obtained this matrix by trial and error. Matrix 2 is produces by Naveen 
using Finger's algorithm, it differs from original matrix across EFA slots as 
well
as in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix 1 does. 

Concluding: we will look at the historical forward prices and try to 
calculate historical correlations from them.

Tanya.

The results were as follows when changing the gas/power correlations:

Correlation  VaR-UK Power book       VaR- UK Gas book
 0.0  o10.405MM       o3.180MM
 0.1  o10.134MM       o3.197MM
 0.2  o10.270MM       o3.185MM
 0.3  o10.030MM       o3.245MM
 0.4  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)
 0.5  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)
 0.6  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)
 0.7  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)
 0.8  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)
 0.9  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)
 1.0  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)
 
Peaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix's 
integrity. 

Interesting to note that for a higher correlation of 0.2 the power VaR 
increases which is counter to intuition.  This implies that we need to look 
into how the correlations are being applied within the model. Once we can 
derive single correlations from the term structure, is the next action to 
understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the P+L 
volatility in the spread option deals.

>From 0.4 onwards the VaR calculation failed.

Everybody,

I attached here the Equity Portfolio VAR spreadsheet model (Version X).
The improvement over the previous version (1X) is that it calculates
an additional measure of risk - Expected Tail Loss.  

Expected Tail Loss is the expectation of the loss under the condition that
losses exceed VAR . As you know Equity VAR model allows you to calculate VAR
for the percentile specified in the input sheet.

Now you have to click 2 more buttons on the "VarInput" sheet:
"Calculate Gamma and Delta" and "Fast VAR".

Isaac, please run the model to make sure it works for you.

Regards,

Tanya

Dear all,

Please see attached spreadsheet - we will have to think of a way to automate 
the position update - right now it's a manual process to convert the text 
file that Andreas sends us to proper spreadsheet format and then pivot table 
the results - only takes about 20 minutes to do this however.  Note that the 
version 1a VaR model links via VLOOKUP to the spreadsheet attached (as you 
know, we have to use VLOOKUP because MG does not necessarily have positions 
in all forward months, whilst the pivot table only produces numbers for 
forward months with a position).

Hi Tanya,

We are using the data for 19th July from Andreas - see file attached.  We are 
using this because we can reconcile to Mercur print out that we got from 
Andreas last Wednesday.  If you don't mind, perhaps Cantekin can try again 
with this new sheet attached.  We already looked at it, but would like to see 
what Cantekin can come up with independently.  I think the positions changed 
a lot from 3rd July (your data) to 19th July.

David and Vince,
in my e-mail below I pointed out to a inconsistency in the portfolio 
hierarchy for UK positions in RisktRac that I found out, 
namely: some books (for example E1SB1 and E1SB2) belong to UK-GAS portfolio 
and to UK-POWER portfolio.
I wanted to clarify this in order to reconcile positions in RisktRac and in 
the spreadsheet.

Subject: Re: UK portfolios and books setup in RisktRac  

Naveen and Matthew,
I started looking systematically through UK positions and corresponding VAR 
numbers in the RisckRac.
I found a few inconsistencies so far.

1. The portfolio E1SB1-NBP has a book E1SB1 under it.  The sum of delta 
positions for this book is 
239,021,655, the sum of gamma positions is -211,031,450. VAR for the 
portfolio E1SB1-NBP is zero.

The same refers to a few other portfolios, for example E1SB2-NBP, E1SB3-NBP, 
E2XX1-NBP.

2. The portfolio E1SBP1-PPP also has the book E1SB1 under it. This book 
contains the positions on PPPWD1
through PPPWD6 and PPPWE1 through PPPWE4. 

The same refers to the other books, for example E1SB2.

This looks messy.  Can someone in RAC go over all the portfolios, all the 
corresponding books and curves
in RisktRac and make sure they are set up properly?

Thank you,

Tanya.

Here are the current issues related to VAR and Credit models:
 
1. Factor loadings (FL) for all "primary" commodities:
- the code is tested;
- factors loadings have been calculated for every primary curve and examined 
closely by Research;
- using different number of maturities for FL calculations (IT);
- selecting "good" curves, setting mappings for the others (RAC);

2. Reviewing Power VAR model:
- implementing term structure of correlations (preliminary research is in 
progress by Research, to be implemented by IT);
- implementing caps in VAR model (IT);
- jumps for intramonth prices (re-examine prices behavior, Research);

3. Historical FF vols (Research, RAC);

4. Interest rate and FX:
- preliminary research is completed (Research);
- implementation in RiskTrack (IT);

5. Credit model:
- resolving the problem of identical runs giving different results (IT with 
Research's help);

6. MG metals VAR model:
- merging with RiskTrack (RAC, IT, Research);
- refining the model (Research);

7. VAR calculations for UK curves:
- merging with RiskTrack, elimination spreadsheets (RAC, IT, Research);
- looking closely at VAR calculations for each commodity;

8. Merchant portfolio VAR:
- unification with Equity VAR model;

9. Fat tails modeling (Research);

It is my preference to have an aggregated VAR methodology for the metals 
business as soon as possible (Version 1a). I do not want to poison progress 
with my opiniion, but I think that the critical first step is to find a way 
to aggregate positions in coarse buckets, perhaps sacrificing precision for 
speed, based on "rules" that oerations can deliver, Research can stand behind 
and Commercial will accept.,  and using an equally coarse VAR calculation 
(the equivalent of AD-hoc VAR?) that can be delivered to the "official books 
and records" on a daily basis.  This I believe would be acceptable for a 2-3 
month time frame (at which time we get version1b) as opposed to waiting 2-3 
months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim.  
Ultimately, I would look for Version 2a to be delivered and very defendable 
by 1/1/01.  This will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but I 
cannot conceive of a better way.  Please let me know if this is consistent 
with your understanding.  A critical point from my perspective is that the MG 
commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making 
this happen and willingness to accept the consequences.  I look for you to 
take the lead as leader of the integration to do so.  If you need any input 
from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know.  As I 
alluded to on the phone, the people in Houston that have been involved in the 
VAR process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of 
VAR by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding 
by all parties as their responsibilities.  Given the distance and the newness 
of the Metals personell, I fear that this could set us all up for some 
surprises and some very uncomfortable communication, much of which is not 
entirely necessary.
Thanks
Ted

Vince, just FYI:
Oliver (Risk Control in London) was asking if it is appropriate to use a set 
of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity.
This "mapping" we do quite frequently in our VAR system when forward prices 
for a commodity are not correlated (because of poor price history).

I think using this kind of mappings is OK because we can not trust these 
correlations based on illiquid price information.
If we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in 
the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors - then
we might use more factors then 7 or the matrix itself.

Subject: Re: UK Power/Gas  

Oliver,
I completely agree with you: validating VAR inputs like positions, prices and 
volatilities which are used by RisktRac is the first thing to do.
You also rise a valid question: if the factor loadings for some commodity do 
not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity?
The factor loadings "do not make sense" when the correlations across the term 
structure are not high. So if we believe that the forward prices for this
commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces 
the correlations which we trust, then it would be proper to use this
correlation matrix in VAR engine, not the factors. Using factors is simply 
the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without 
sacrificing the accuracy.

Tanya.

Naveen

Regarding the calculation of UK VaRs in Risk Trac I agree that we should be 
using this calculation engine for all commodity VaRs. However we should not 
focus solely on the UK but ensure that we use Risk Trac for continental power 
and gas, UK power and gas, Nordic Power. 

To use Risk Trac I think the following need to be resolved first, to 
implement it "right the first time",  as I think it is incorrect to consider 
the Risk Trac numbers "As the most accurate" since it depends on the validity 
of these items:

Positions (Delta and gamma) and curve mapping - These need to include all 
positions including those outside the main risk systems
 Positions, curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds, 
apart from continental power, have been UAT'd and we have the   spreadsheet 
feeds up and running.

Price and vol curves - As used by the risk systems
 As above

Inter commodity correlation - prompt month
 Correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data 
set (However the incomplete historic data for Europe in Risk   Trac, prior to 
the formation of the task force, would mean a full data set needs to be 
obtained and used). Term structure of correlation would be  good but I 
understand this is difficult to use in the calculation.

Factor loadings
  I think factor loadings should be calculated, on the same data sets used 
for inter commodity correlation, for all commodities. If this analysis   does 
not appear to work I am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets 
is adequate. Do we need to consider an alternative approach  to calculating 
VaR for these markets?

To ensure this moves forward I think a list of the mile stones, 
responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise I fear the 
process of moving across to Risk Trac from the spreadsheet VaR will 
experience some slippage.

I will call today to start the process off.

Subject: UK Power/Gas

Oliver,
          I had a couple of issues pertaining to UK Power/UK Gas.  First, 
just a few notes as it pertains to Risk Trac UK-implementation:

(1) In RiskTrac, currently all the Gas Curves are mapped to NBP.
(2) All the Power Curves are mapped to R4 (Cinergy).

Factor loading analysis lends itself only to NBP and the Norewgian curves(for 
reasons of liquidity, etc).  We have decided that NBP and Cinergy are the 
best curves available at this time.  
The spreadsheet which is utilized in the UK also has curves mapped to a 
2-3-year old set of Factors derived from US Nat Gas, which is clearly not 
optimal.   Hence

(1) We should be using RiskTrac numbers for VaR, as it is the "most 
accurate", both in terms of ENE-wide model usage and in terms of the most 
recent updated data.  Ever since UK Power came on board in RiskTrac 3 weeks 
ago, the UK Power number has been consistently 7-8MM above the numbers in 
your spreadsheet.  This difference is to be ecpected, given the different 
inputs.
(2) The consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way, 
however, if you believe that positions are not captured correctly, please let 
our IT staff know that.  
(3) Checks which Ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in.  
However, as you know, there could be disconnects with Enpower, etc.

In any event, it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run 
out of RiskTrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis.  
Your help is appreciated.

Regards
Naveen

Naveen,

I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts.
For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as
well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:

[ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)

and compared the results to normal distribution. 

I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! 

Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large 
returns more frequent than normal), 
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

See the spreadsheet is under O:\_Dropbox\Tanya

Anjam and Kirstee,


As I have suspected the position as of 6/30 vs 7/19 makes the difference. The 
first table first column is my VAR number with 6/30 position and gold&silver 
prices, the second column is your VAR with 7/19 position and dummy 
gold&silver prices. The second table first column is my VAR with 7/19 
position and 6/30 gold&silver prices, the second column is as before.

I would ask you to plug the gold and silver prices and see what kind of 
numbers you get in order to verify we are on the same page. Please refer to 
MODELVAR2000.xls that I have sent you for gold & silver prices and 
volatilities. 

Thank you,
Cantekin

Ted,
         An update on the implementation for FFVols:
                  (1) In comparing 6 days of historical Var calculations 
(with that of the implied) for Agg-Gas, we have found that the Historical VaR 
calculations are consistently lower over this period, by roughly 17 MM.  The 
implied volatilities are much higher at this period, anticipating strong 
winter prices.
                  (2) At this time, the consensus is not to relase the 
historical implementation into production, and the official line to traders 
will be that the method is still in testing.  The historical VaR is 19.2MM 
and the implied is 37 MM for effective date of 09/25.    
                  (3) Further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology 
(which I mentioned last week, whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio 
of prompt to historical-prompt volatilities), to atleast  capture some 
implied/forward effects.  Tanya's analysis on a  fictitious portfolio 
indicates higher VaR numbers, but poorer backtesting in comparison to the 
historical approach.  This approach serves as an intermediate, and seems 
appropriate in periods such as the current one, wherein the historical 
numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied.
               (4) Winston will start  testing using these hybrid vols, and 
if the results are deemed satisfactory, that will be the production 
methodology.

Of course, we will obtain all VaR numbers concurrently to serve as different 
indicators and beacons of risk.  The production number will hopefully be a 
sensible compromise of the different methods. 

Regards
Naveen

Frank, 
regarding simulating power prices in VAR we might discuss the following items
and show some results:
1. Clustering for power:
 - clustering based on historical prices and correlations from them;
 - geographical clustering;
 - flexibility in choosing "core curves" (based on position size);
2. Jump-diffusion process for intramonth and prompt month:
 - parameter estimation from historical data (do we want to use it?)
 - working out parameters (jumps frequency, jump size) as stress scenarios;
3. Correlations within a cluster and across clusters.
4. Changing correlations estimations (using fixed contact' time series).
5. Joint estimation of factors for selected regions.

Let me know what you think should be in the agenda for this meeting.

Regards,

Tanya

Hi all,
I have run the VaR model for the positions at close fo business 28th of July. 
The model is attached below.


As a summary the results are as follows :



and as a comparison the previous days figures were :




This shows some increase in VaR for Aluminium, Copper and Lead. The prices 
for gold and cocoa beans have not been updated 
as we still do not have a live feed to Bloomberg/Reuters. I will be working 
on this with Cantekin and Andreas should also be able to 
provide some more historical data. 
Also, after having a discussion with Andreas here in London we should 
probably reduce the vol we are using for TC - we are taking the Cu price 
vol as a proxy which is a too high. However, assuming the the other 
assumptions we have made around the TC ( ie simulating a parallel shift in 
the curve and 
including no term structure to the price curve) the vol estimate is a 
conservative one.

Cheers
Kirstee

Grant,

Would you take a look at the following correlation matrix? Does it make sense?

PS: This is an updated correlation matrix with gold and silver correlations. 
I used Bloomberg's generic closest month gold and silver contract prices for 
the correlation analysis.

as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please,
implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves the following:

1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want to use
and which Enron's curves belong to each region.
2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each region. This decision can 
be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might be other considerations.
3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core curve.

Winston,
can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo with clustering done by SAS?
Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this? 

Tanya.

Dear all,

I am leaving the office now, and sending you the preliminary model 1a for MG 
Metals VaR that Tanya, Cantekin, Kirstee have put together.  We are now in a 
position to look at the VaR by metal for positions as of 19th July 2000, 
subject to some data that needs updating/correcting; we still need to update 
some information/data flow processes as follows:-

i) Factor Loadings for silver, gold, cocoa beans and TC (treatment charge for 
copper concentrate)
ii) Check correlations between Nickel and Alu and Nickel and Copper (I got 
different answers to Houston)
iii) Ensure latest forward price curves are included (perhaps through live 
link to Telerate/Reuters)
iiia) Price for silver is wrong (units should be $ per troy ounce), and 
similarly for gold (price should be $ per troy ounce), also we need cocoa 
bean forward curve
iv) Find a better way to extract positional information from MG Metals/link 
to the spreadsheet in an automated fashion
v) Add "minor" metals like cobalt, palladium, platinum, cadmium etc. (N.B. we 
have 1,093 troy ounces of palladium short posn and 3,472 troy ounces platinum 
long as of 19th July)

Please feel free to add to this list if I have missed anything; I believe 
that we have most of the bases covered in respect of issues to resolve ahead 
of the deadline of 7th August and fully expect that we will deliver.

Regards,

Anjam Ahmad

Lloyd,

Speaking from experience, I think that it's critical for Tanya and Anjam to 
visit MG in New York
and establish direct relationship with technical people. Merging two risk 
management systems
requires handling many very technical issues and face to face discussions 
between IT and quants
 will be very helpful.

Tanya,

I think most of your queries can be dealt with on the phone - I'll be at MG 
with Andreas today and we'll call you.   Most of these points have already 
been covered with Anjam in any case.  I'm also attaching a file downloaded 
from Mercur (MG's risk aggregation system) showing monthly total positions 
for each metal in each entity.  You can fairly easily create tables and graph 
what you want to see.  We can talk today about getting a full deal download.

Hi Andreas,

Here are the issues we would like to discuss on our Thursday meeting in NY:

1. Inputs for options valuation, in particular the origins of volatility 
curves;
2. Information on exotic options structures (existing & potential);
3. The data flow (are we going to get data from London or NY).
4a. Storage of positions information at  MG. How to extract the positions 
info from
MG database into spreadsheets.
4b. Existing positions structure for each metal.
5. Introduction to concentrates trading business, key personnel.

Best Regards,

Tanya & Anjam

Nick and Winston,
I understand that IR&FX VAR numbers are calculated every day in RisktRac. 
This results are overwritten
everyday in the database table by the official numbers calculated with the 
old version of the code.
For the consistent testing we need historical results for each IR and FX 
sub-portfolio.
Can we store the numbers every day?

Tanya

Naveen,
as we discussed yesterday, I would like to see the results of Components VAR 
testing.
I got some from Sunil today for AGG-GAS. 
In addition if you can send me Component Var results for NG-PRICE for some 
date,
as well as NG positions, forward price curve, forward volatility curve for 
NG-PRICE-PRC for that
same date, I can verify the numbers.

Thank you,

Tanya.

Thanks for the update - especially your point 3 which echoes our own 
discussion yesterday: I want to clarify responsibilities for maintenance and 
administration of VAR. 
We need transparency around the process so that mapping decisions, for 
example, are easily made, supported and reviewed. 

It became clear after last Friday's events, that we are in an awkward 
paradigm with respect to how we handle VAR here, particularly at "pressure 
points".

I am putting together the scope of a "general overhaul" of the VAR process, 
including method and administration, to which I hope we would all buy in, so 
be assured of our co-operation.

DP

Subject: VaR

David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery 
is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the 
problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can 
increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will 
investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity 
should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense 
to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less 
transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be 
systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the 
trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the 
responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

Vince

Tentative agenda for the Research Lunch meeting on Wednesday, August 2nd at 
11:30 am:

Objective: Develop a methodology and a model for estimating risks of the EES 
Regulatory portfolio.

Discussion Items:

1. Elements of the Regulatory portfolio

 - Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Positions
 - Bundled Tariffs (full utility tariffs that are in place prior to 
deregulation)
 - Competitive Transition Charges (CTC) Positions
 - Diversification between the three risk elements

2. Risk drivers in each bucket (Scott Stoness of EES to provide more detail)

 - T&D: interest rates
 - Bundled Tariffs: regulatory decisions, power prices, interest rates, 
inflation
 - CTC: power prices, fuel prices, generation valuation, generation stack, 
regulatory decisions

3. Position aggregation parameters (Scott Stoness of EES to provide 
suggestions)

 - by NERC Region
 - by state
 - by utility
 - by utility tariff

4. Model environment

 - Excel
 - GRMS/RisktRAC
 - Other

5. VaR Parameters

 - correlations
 - factor loadings (1-factor model?)
 - other

6. EES specific issues

 - The size of CTC positions is impacted by the roll-off date, which is 
subject to change due to a number of factors (jump diffusion?)
 - T&D and Bundled Tariffs do not move daily, but rather once every 2-3 years 
(event driven?)

Thanks, Vlady.

PS: Shirley, could you please make the lunch arrangements accordingly.

Lloyd,

Speaking from experience, I think that it's critical for Tanya and Anjam to 
visit MG in New York
and establish direct relationship with technical people. Merging two risk 
management systems
requires handling many very technical issues and face to face discussions 
between IT and quants
 will be very helpful.  

Vince

Tanya,

I think most of your queries can be dealt with on the phone - I'll be at MG 
with Andreas today and we'll call you.   Most of these points have already 
been covered with Anjam in any case.  I'm also attaching a file downloaded 
from Mercur (MG's risk aggregation system) showing monthly total positions 
for each metal in each entity.  You can fairly easily create tables and graph 
what you want to see.  We can talk today about getting a full deal download.

Regards

Subject: Agenda for NY MG Metals Visit  

Hi Andreas,

Here are the issues we would like to discuss on our Thursday meeting in NY:

1. Inputs for options valuation, in particular the origins of volatility 
curves;
2. Information on exotic options structures (existing & potential);
3. The data flow (are we going to get data from London or NY).
4a. Storage of positions information at  MG. How to extract the positions 
info from
MG database into spreadsheets.
4b. Existing positions structure for each metal.
5. Introduction to concentrates trading business, key personnel.

Best Regards,

Tanya & Anjam

Bjorn, Niamh Clarke is going to come to houston from mon afternoon to friday 
next week to work on nVAR. She developed VAR models for Mitsubishi and has 
lots of experience in this area. Can you please provide her with the best 
people we can from research and RAC so we can try and get a better 
understanding and more confidence in our model. I'm sure you agree with me 
that if my group is going to make any progress we need to get this sorted. 
thanks in advance.

I think we need to sit down and talk about developing reporting that will 
show the risk in the books. At this point and time it can be derived, but 
only if you know what to look for. I would appreciate if you had some time to 
do so.

looking at these numbers i think the VAR model must be waaaaaaaaaay over 
calcing something, most likely the spreads. the net and outright product 
position are negligible. Seems it would take one hell of a daily move to 
loose 12.7 on these positions.

Hi Esther,

I just talked to John Sherriff about his "Enron" copper position.  I suspect 
that this is not currently being captured within the MG Mercur position 
database - he would like to have that included in the VaR spreadsheet and 
shown as a separate line.  Do you have any information regarding this deal 
(i.e. position sizes, qualities etc.) or be able to direct me to someone who 
may be able to assist in getting this information?

Thanks,

Naveen and Matthew,
I started looking systematically through UK positions and corresponding VAR 
numbers in the RisckRac.
I found a few inconsistencies so far.

1. The portfolio E1SB1-NBP has a book E1SB1 under it.  The sum of delta 
positions for this book is 
239,021,655, the sum of gamma positions is -211,031,450. VAR for the 
portfolio E1SB1-NBP is zero.

The same refers to a few other portfolios, for example E1SB2-NBP, E1SB3-NBP, 
E2XX1-NBP.

2. The portfolio E1SBP1-PPP also has the book E1SB1 under it. This book 
contains the positions on PPPWD1
through PPPWD6 and PPPWE1 through PPPWE4. 

The same refers to the other books, for example E1SB2.

This looks messy.  Can someone in RAC go over all the portfolios, all the 
corresponding books and curves
in RisktRac and make sure they are set up properly?

Thank you,

Tanya.

Evidently CIBC has purchased some software to help quantify there exposure.

Hi Richard,

Lloyd Fleming introduced me to the key personnel on the trading and risk side 
at MG today; I spent most of today discussing forward curves and option 
volatilities with Tim Jones, Russell Plackett and Jon Barrett.  I hope to be 
able to get historical data from David Thompson to facilitate forward curve 
analysis for our VaR models.  Also discussed valuation issues (e.g. option on 
calendar spread that they need a model for).  Also was able to get a good 
understanding of trading strategies and nuances of aluminum, copper and 
nickel markets.

Regards,

Anjam

Deal entry
The need for 3 data-entry clerks becomes clearer when we understand that 
between 200 and 2000 manual deal tickets are written each day which then have 
to be keyed in.

Romulus
The trading assets of Rudolf Wolff in London and New York were bought after 
close of play on Friday.
Included with the metals trading is a proprietary FX desk, and a softs desk, 
trading coffee, cocoa, and sugar.
The softs people are expected to arrive in Enron House at the end of July.

EOL
Two metals trades have been executed on EOL.

Hi Tanya,

Attached are the live Reuters-linked volatility curves.  Please don't 
re-establish links, as I don't think that your Telerate connection works in 
the same way as ours in London.  I will get back to you on cleaning up the 
historical forward curve database as I complete each metal.  We can talk at 
5pm as we agreed.

Jaesoo,
as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please,
implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves the following:

1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want to use
and which Enron's curves belong to each region.
2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each region. This decision can 
be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might be other considerations.
3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core curve.

Winston,
can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo with clustering done by SAS?
Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this? 

Tanya.

Winston,
I am sending you FFD vol curves which are calculated based on 1 month (18 
log-returns)
of data with 0.97 decay factor. These vols give $3.14 M in VAR for 
STORAGE-PRC (versus 3.37 in production
for 5/30/00).

Tell me what I need to change in the format so that it is convenient for you.

We are proposing the following changes to the calculation of NG correlations:

1. weight the data set (3 calendar months) used in calculating correlations 
(most recent data weighed heavier)
2. use respective contract prices, instead of prompt month prices (i.e. for 
Nov-00 correlations use Nov contract prices for the last 3 months, as opposed 
to prompt month prices for the last three months.


Tanya,

I have confirmed with Ted and he gave us green light to make both changes. 
Did we get an opinion from Vince?

Winston,

It is my understanding, that this changes apply to NG correlations only, not 
the correlations between commodities. We will test the changes in gas and 
then decide on world-wide implementation. Any estimate on timing of this 
implementation?

Cassandra,

Ted suggested that you and Veronica should document this as a change in VaR 
parameters and inform all commercial desk heads of these changes. We intend 
to make them for NA gas first, but ultimately make these changes consistent 
across all commodity groups. Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks, Vlady.

Vlady,

Also in the meeting, we identified that there are still some issures 
regarding to the correlation matrix calculations.

Since different commodity has different expiration dates.  When calculate 
correlation between two commodities, the two may have different prompt 
months.  Are we going to use prices on two different prompt months OR are we 
going to use the prices on the SAME month disregarding prompt months.

Because above issues, Jin is not going do any changes on the correlation 
matrix calculation until above issures can be solved.

Thanks!

Winston

Vlady, we met with Winston and Jin today regarding VAR calibration issues.

The outcome on this discussion is:
1. Jin will put weights into calculation of factor loadings;
2. Jin will change the way factor loading are calculated. For each commodity 
the prompt month contract will be selected for the effective date of vatrfacs 
run.
Then the historical prices will be collected for 3 month for all forward 
contracts starting from
selected prompt month contract. The variance-covariance matrix will be 
calculated
based on these data, it will be converted into correlation matrix, then 
factor loadings 
analysis will be performed on the correlation matrix.


Tanya.

David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

Everybody,

this week our regular meeting will be devoted primarily to 2 subjects:
1. Simulating power prices in VAR;
2. Capturing correlations across commodities as well as across term structure of
forward prices.

Research will present some suggestions based on data analysis.

Detailed agenda is enclosed.

Please, let Shirley Crenshaw know if you are not planning to attend.

Jason,
After our brief discussion last night I think I should discuss a few of the 
issues I have with respect to calculating a VaR on the deal that you are 
proposing.  The VaR model, as I illustrated, is set up to accept a term 
structure of delta positions, prices and vols and it may be difficult to 
translate the 'silver mine' position into these inputs. 
I do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and 
then make some assumptions about vol and price. The VaR model 
also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding 
period. 
To do this properly I would need to understand fully how the deal is priced 
as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in MTM 
in the future and that is essentially what VaR is supposed to predict.
If you need me to work on this then you need to contact Steve who will help 
to prioritise my time. I will also need to consult with Vince Kaminski and 
Tanya Tamarachenko in Houston for advice.
RAC will also assist in the process.
Please contact me if you have any further questions,
Kirstee

Tanya,

As we discussed in the last meeting, to simulate secondary power curve we need correlated jump sizes. This is totally different from the current secondary price curve simulation which assume the perfect correlation and also totally different from the secondary GAS basis curve simulation which is based on the hedging ratio.

There are two more issues on my side I need to resolve:
1. I want resolve the power basis curve issue.  Currently all power position on these basis curve are actually price positions.  We are hard coding this: if power basis we add basis to corresponding region curve.  I am trying to remove this hard coding by asking loading the price curve for all these basis locations.

2. Same is true for all those Power F curves.  These curves looks similar to those basis curves.  Currently we just directly map these F curves to the corresponding region curves.  I would also prefer to load the price curves instead of the price differences.

>From research, I need those jump size correlations.

Clearly, all these involve many new development, unless we want to use simpler way to simulate secondary power curves.

Regards,

Winston

Jaesoo,
as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please,
implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves the following:

1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want to use
and which Enron's curves belong to each region.
2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each region. This decision can 
be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might be other considerations.
3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core curve.

Winston,
can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo with clustering done by SAS?
Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this? 

Tanya.

Tanya,

We are very close to generating factors for all primary curves.  Jin almost 
get it done.

But we are still waiting on the expiration dates for those London curves.  If 
anyone can help, please help.

Also, we have some curves that don't have Futures.  How to decide these 
curves's expiration dates?

Matthew Adams helped us deciding many curves expiration rules.  But there are 
still many primary curves that don't have expiration dates.

If no expiration dates, then there will be no factor loadings.  Whoever wants 
to generate factor loadings then give us the expiration dates first! :)

Bjorn,
you are absolutely right that we should run the factors for every primary 
curve.
IT has been working  for a while on this.
The problem is data, as always (missing price curves, zero prices, not 
changing prices, etc.)
Most of these problems come from London curves, so Winston and Jin Yu are 
debugging the code,
fixing the problems for every curve.

Winston,
do you think we are ready to calculate factors for US curves? (while continue 
working on the rest).

at least you have 2 curves that you get factors for.  I get none.  I have 
four primary curves for coal but factors from NBSK are used.  In emissions I 
have one primary curve but WTI factors are used.  I think all the primary

Subject: Primary curves missing from Factor Loading

I was in the process of setting up Sunil's template for calculating 
co-variance on all Liquids primary curves using the "factor loading" data.  
Unfortunately, I did not get very far, because I noticed that the factor 
loading table contains only 2 (WTI & HU) out of 13 liquids primary curves.  I 
am concern that Liquids VaR could conceivably be over or understated due to 
the absence of 11 other curves which are listed below.  Please verify your

Hi Kirstee,

Thanks again for all your work on MG. One think to double check is units.
Please, make sure that the prices are quoted in the same units our positions

One potential source of confusion arises from the fact that we are dealing

I was waiting for a comment about the email below before sending it to the 
full mailing list. Basically it suggests that the 
copper option position may well have increased the VaR by more than $500,000. 
However, given that the portfoilo has also 
changed from the 1st of August it is difficult to asses the actual change due 
to the option only.

Subject: VaR for COB 2nd Aug 2000

Hi all,
The CU option position has entered the MG books for the 2nd Aug. The delta is 
35299$/mt for Dec 2000. The Cu VaR has gone up 
from $2,245,000 to $3,306,000. I estimated that the portfolio for the 1st 
would increase to approx $3,039,000 so this seems sensible. 
The overall VaR change is from $4,780,796 to $5,991,569. Again, the estimate 
for the 1st Aug was for an increase in VaR to ~ $5,476,000.
All estimates were based on a delta of 32,0004/dmt.
There has also been some increase in the VaR for Aluminium which will effect 
the overall total.
A summary is as follows :

Kirstee

Naveen,

Most of these tests have been already coded. The code and the associated
spreadsheets may have been lost inn the sands of time. Please, check with
Vasant: it may save you some time.

Vince,
             I am currently implementing the backtesting features into our 
Risk Management system.  I distributed the following document at our research 
meeting today; it outlines the conventional binomial test and some other 
tests, including the Basle regulatory test.   Of course, no one test is 
powerful and the efficacy of these tests breakdown for low sample sizes, 
etc.  If you can think of other tests to complement these, please let me know.

Tanya,
              I went through the comparisons for the Liquids curves and the 
appearance of clear parallel shifts, etc, do begin to emerge when fewer 
forward prices are used.  It looks sensible.  I have passed the graphs over 
to the liquids people, and I have asked them to identify rough term structure 
months when illiquidity begins for these curves.  It might coincide with your 
assumptions.  I am surprised by Brent and Dubai, which should be WTI-clones.

Naveen & Vlady,
Jin Yu finished debugging the vatrfacs code and now it calculates factor 
loadings for every "primary" curve (except power curves).
I am sending you the calculated factors:

Most of them don't look good. 60 forward prices were used in calculations for 
each commodity.
I reran the code using fewer forward prices depending on the commodity
(12 prices for C3GC,MTBE,NC4,SO2,
17 prices for NXHO, 18 - for SA,
24 for C2GC, LAX_JFK,,
30 -for Condensate, Dubaicrude, Brent,,
48 for NSW, Semichem-Risi)
These results are in 

Most of them look much better.
Please, review.
We will have to add a column in rms_main_curve_list to specify how many 
forward prices we want to use for each commodity,
and then use the new factors in the VAR model.

Tanya.

      (Document link: Vince J Kaminski)

Naveen,
the "analytical VAR" approach is working for Equity portfolio.
It gives us the tool to examine the tails' behavior for this portfolio and
calculate "Expected Tail Loss".
The same should be done for commodities portfolio as well.

Meanwhile, as we discussed, we can give some rough estimates of the losses
corresponding to percentiles other than 5th.

Look at the figure below. You can see VAR numbers for 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
calculated with
1) simulations (100 thousand simulations);
2) analytical VAR (gamma-delta positions representation)

     1) and 2) are very close because there are not many options in Equity
portfolio.

3) simulations (1000 simulations) to calculate 5% VAR. Then in order to
approximately estimate VAR for 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
I scaled 5% VAR with factors corresponding to normal distribution (for
example: Norminv(0.001,0,1)/Norminv(0.05,0,1) for 0.1%).
The result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good (just 5%
different from the correct number).
We probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio
until we have proper methods implemented.

Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of
"analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

Tanya

Hi Vince,

Thanks for the e-mail.  We have included live links to price curves through 
Reuters quotes via Telerate Bridge but we still have static curves for gold 
and cocoa.  Kirstee is talking to Andreas in NY to obtain position files on a 
daily basis, addressing point 2) in your e-mail, as well as looking into 
longer term integration issues.  Cantekin and I have agreed the correct 
correlations for the metals between us, but Cantekin is currently checking 
the correlations for silver and gold.  Preliminary results based on positions 
as of 19th July are as follows:



We noticed that position mapping at the front months can change VaR 
significantly.

As you stated, Kirstee Hewitt will now be assuming responsibility for further 
modifications to the model on the London side and to this end I have ensured 
that Kirstee is put in touch with key personnel like Andreas (Andreas will be 
in the London office next week) and has access to all the information she 
needs.

Winston and Jin,
for last half year the following developments were implemented by Jin for 
vatrfacs code
(the calibration code for VAR):
1. Weighting the log-returns with exponential decay factor while calculating 
correlations;
2. Calculating factors and correlations for UK curves;
3. Joint estimation of factor loading for selected groups of commodities;
4. Alternative method for collecting historical data for correlations 
calculation 
(based on fixed contract instead of collecting prompt, prompt+1, etc. prices)

In order to release these developments Research has to have each version under
Clearcase. Then we will:
1. Run  vatrfacs code in stage environment (stage has been refreshed 
recently). 
2. Run VAR code in stage and validate the results.

It is time to start releasing these 4 versions. Projects 3 and 4 require some 
experimental runs
in stage. A few traders (in Gas, Power and Liquids markets) are expecting the 
results.

Meanwhile the following developments have been suggested by Reseach, approved 
by Risk Control,
submitted to IT as spreadsheet prototypes and waiting in line:
1. Volatility blending for intramonth power positions;
2. Forward volatility smoothing and extracting forward forward volatilities;

Hope we can follow our procedures to make all these developments go smoothly 
and efficiently.

Tanya.
