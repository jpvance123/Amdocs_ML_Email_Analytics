In case you haven't already printed out the previous attachment, the version attached below has been reformatted to remove all the section breaks that make it print out partial pages.

 
Also, I will be on vacation this Friday and all of next week, but Leslie can fill me in on the meeting.  According to the Government Printing Office web site as of a minute ago, the Federal Register notice has not been issued yet, so the due date is at least 46 days away.
