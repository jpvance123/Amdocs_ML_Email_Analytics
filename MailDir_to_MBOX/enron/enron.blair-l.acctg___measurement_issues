The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today's business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.
Thanks-
Gary

Subject:	FW: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

Thanks,

Raetta

I have looked at the DDVC invoices for Midwest for March, 2001 which total $304.70.  The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.

Thanks,

Subject:	Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

All of the MidAmerican corrections for October have been made with the exception of 0737181-01,0737021-01, & 0737021-02. The charts were never received form these locations. Dan Boswell has been out of the office due to his Father's death but should be back tomorrow. We'll get a handle on the other outstanding PPAs this week.

Subject:	October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status

	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

Gary,  I received a call on 11/13 from Bill Lindley (Clayton Energy) agent for City of Hartley, IA.  Bill was inquiring about the actual daily volume allocations at POI 60551, Meter Number 722015-01.  He incurred about $5,503.35 in DDVC penalties for the month of Oct.  2001 due to daily variances at the TBS.  Bill was asking if the actuals were estimated from the 17th - 31st.  In checking with Frankie the end of the month index readings were used to estimate the volume due to the chart being received after close.  

Bill (Clayton Energy) has requested that we pull the chart(s) and check the reading to verify that the penalties and the daily volume are correct for the month of Oct..  Bill has provided me with the daily readings from his check meter at this TBS to compare with.  This check will determine if the daily volumes need to be reallocated and a PPA generated.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.

I believe this generated $75 worth of discretion with Midwest Gas.  Unless I am not seeing something here, I don't feel as though investing dollars to install EFM or Bullhorn would be a good idea.

As we discussed, we have had inadequate measurement devices at several loca=

there is an associated cost of doing business that can't be ignored as we h=

atisfy the requirement for daily readings that are needed to calculate the =
volumes.  This issue has become very visible lately due to complaints from =
our customers and the fact that we are assessing penalties on systematicall=

Chris,  Raetta has put together a list of the 16 day charts that need to be read for the last half of Oct. 2001.  This list does not include the 31 day charts.  GMS just estimates the 31 day charts daily flow based on the index readings received. You may want to discuss this with IES.  I will send the list of 16 day charts to GMS this morning.  If you have any questions please give me a call.

Chris,

I just got done reviewing some of the data in the October SMS invoice for IES and I can see some major problems.  It looks to me like about 1/2 of the gates have daily estimated usage during the last half of the month which caused us to incur numerous DDVC penalties which I don't believe are correct in both Zone BC and Zone D.

It was obvious that the data was estimated because the flow is almost exactly the same every day for the last two weeks of the month (I suspect it only varies a little due to the BTU factor).  We were getting penalties on the warm days in the second half of the month because you are overestimating the load on those days.  Some of the larger gates to look at include Cherokee(2870), Jefferson(2873), Iowa Falls(2876), Britt(2877) Eldora(2878), Mt Vernon(2880), Vinton(2881) & Alto (3574), but there are many others.

I need to look at this more a lot more, including other months, but before I waste more of my time, I'd like to know how and why these were estimated and if you are already working on a correction.  This is the kind of thing that makes in very difficult for us because we have to rely on your billing data which only is available two weeks after a month ends and that isn't even very good.  The way you are doing it, I don't even understand how you can bill us for DDVC's.  

>From now on, I think I'd like to get a statement each month of all the estimated data when we get the bill, so we know what to look for. 

Thanks,
Jeff

FYI.  The message below details the procedure and incremental O&M expenses associated with getting charts/index readings from 52 MidAmerican stations in the Des Moines Region to Gas Measurement Services by the 3rd working day of each month.  I will develop and distribute the estimated incremental O&M expenses required to achieve this objective for all 7 day and 16 day charts in the NNG system by Friday, December 7th.

Subject:	Mailing MidAmerican Charts by 3rd Business Day

There are currently 168 MidAmerican chart and index-read stations in the North Operations area. There are 52 of these stations in the Des Moines Region. 19 of these charts are changed by MidAmerican on a 7-day cycle, while third-party chart changers change the others on a 16 or 31-day cycle. To ensure that these charts/indexes are delivered to Gas Measurement Services by the 3rd business day of each month, the following procedure has been proposed. 

1.	New blank envelopes will be purchased and  distributed.
2.	Prepaid USPS Express Mail labels (@$12.45 each) would be purchased for each envelope.
3.	The chart changer (or someone) would be required to fill out the Express Mail label by hand.
4.	The chart changer will drop the envelopes off at any official US Postal Drop location the same day the chart is changed.

It is assumed that the charts currently changed by MidAmerican would remain changed, and that they would utilize the Priority Mail method also.

For the Des Moines Region, this change will cost an estimated increase of from $1538 to $3237 per month (includes cost of chart changing and postage). In the event that MidAmerican stops changing the charts at the 19 stations in the Waterloo area, then contract chart changers would be utilized. This would increase the cost to an approximated $3484 per month. 

An additional cost not yet quantified is training. Training would be required for all chart changers, both contract and MidAmerican. An approximated cost is three man-days.

Extrapolating this to the rest of the MidAmerican stations, the approximate cost to implement this change using US Express Mail will increase costs by at least $4500 per month, more if contract chart changers are required to change chart that MidAmerican is currently changing. The details are shown below. The attached spreadsheet is a consolidation of the MidAmerican stations.  

 


Details

Summarizing the information regarding the MidAmerican charted stations I received from the Ogden and Waterloo Teams (Platteville has no MidAmerican stations) in the Des Moines Region is shown below.  

Current method:

Ogden:		$42 per station per month 

33 MidAm stations (16 day charts)
		$40 per month for chart change (2 changes per month by contractor)
		Mailed using NNG envelopes with pre-paid postage. ($2 each)


Waterloo:	$8 per station per month

19 MidAm stations (7 day charts)
		$0 per month for chart change (4 changes per month - by MidAm)
		Mailed using NNG envelopes with pre-paid postage. ($2 each)


Current costs are $1538 per month (33 stations x $42 + 19 stations x $2) 


Proposed method (sending charts/indexes by overnight mail):

Ogden:		$67 per station per month

33 MidAm stations (16 day charts)
		$40 per month for chart change (2 changes per month)
		Mailed using USPS Priority Mail ($13.50 each)


Waterloo:	$54 per station per month

19 MidAm stations (7 day charts)
		$0 per month chart change (4 changes per month - by MidAm)
		Mailed using USPS Priority Mail ($13.50 each)

Proposed costs for Next Day/Priority Mail would be $3237 per month 
(33 stations x $67 + 19 stations x $54)

In the event that MidAm stops changing the charts in the Waterloo area, the estimated costs would be $67 per station per month ( $20 per chart change + $13.50 postage -- twice monthly). 

Proposed costs would be then be $3484 per month (52 stations x $67).

On behalf of Dave Neubauer,Frank Semin, Lynn Blair and Jodie Floyd:

In follow-up to our conference call Thursday morning, we would like to communicate the "To-dos" we are recommending.  It is very important that we get the charts to Houston by the 3rd business day of the month.  We need to encourage chart changers to get their charts in the mail immediately.  As the charts are received in Houston, it is recommended that Gas Measurement Services will be in charge of not only inputting the chart data, but also tracking and keeping a report on when each chart is received.  Once we determine which charts are consistently late, we will determine what action needs to be taken to get the charts in on time, whether it be Priority Mail Service or Overnight Service.  Prior Period Adjustments will be done on each chart that is received late.  As we continue to work through this problem, ongoing research and planning will be done to ensure that a capital commitment is made to get technology installed to eliminate this ongoing issue.

1) It is important that the Operations personnel communicate to the chart changers the importance of getting the charts in the mail box immediately.
2) Effective immediately, it is recommended that Gas Measurement Services track the receipt of the charts and provide a report to Gas Logistics (Jodie Floyd) and Marketing that details which charts aren't coming in on time.  We need to have the report shortly after GMS closes, so that we can make efforts to locate the missing charts and get them to Houston as soon as possible.
3) Once we identify the charts that we are coming in late, we will provide either Priority Mail envelopes or Overnight envelopes to those stations so we can ensure that the chart will be on time the following month.
4) PPAs will continue on all charts that are received late.
5) Measurement will review possible technology to improve the accuracy of our measurements, i.e. temperature-based calculation, chart delineator.

If you have any questions, please contact Courtney Barker (Marketing) at (402) 398-7130 or Jodie Floyd (Gas Logistics) at (713) 853-1465.

Please forward this on to any necessary personnel.
