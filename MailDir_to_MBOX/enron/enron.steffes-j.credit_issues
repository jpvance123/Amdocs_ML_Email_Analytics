Sure - I talked to Ed Sacks and there are some on the list that he is already working on.  I imagine that we have defaulted under the surety and the CP can now collect, but have not seen the actual notices yet.  I have asked Mary Grisaffi to forward them to Carol St. Clair for review.

Molly - WGL's tariff allows them to demand collateral acceptable to them (cash, l/c, bonds) if we do not meet their credit qualifications (pp. 42-43 of MD tariff), which we don't.  The security requirement they have calculated (contained in Craig's earlier e-mail) of $1.0 million follows a process that is used for all gas marketers and was approved through the "Gas Roundtable" in MD, a cross-sectional group of industry players in MD.  In other words, the MD Commission would uphold this calculation.

I talked to Frank Donnelly, financing director, and Shelley Jennings, corporate treasurer, of WGL about the calculation.  Nearly all of the collateral is related to "delivery risk", which is 60 days of peak day usage, reduced by about 50%, priced at a forward NYMEX price.  This is not terribly unreasonable, and as I say, it would be acceptable to the MD PSC.

I told Frank and Shelly we'd let them know, one way or another, our response by this Friday.  Thanks.

Molly & Teresa,

Harry Kingerski suggested I forward this issue to you.  WGL has a $1.1 bond requirement due on 11/30.  Mary Grisaffi (RAC) tried to obtain a bond last week and was unsuccessful due to Enron's credit rating.

Below are the attached files describing the bond requirement and calculation.  WGL's POC is Francis 
Donelly at (202) 624-6062.  Harry is researching the tariff to determine the validity of this requirement.

Please contact me if you have any questions and/or require further information.


Thanks,

Craig

Rolf, the following excerpt was sent to me from BGE - who should it be forwarded to? 

Mark Valavanis (my workleader) asked me to notify the enrollment
person from Enron that no future enrollments (DRS and daily metered) can be
processed until additional collateral requirements are met.  Any questions
concerning this issue should be addressed to Tony Evering of our credit
department @ 410-209-1613.  From what I understand, a letter was mailed to
Enron concerning this.

You can still issue terminations, just not enrollments.

Mike Smith and Jim Steffes just phoned and indicated that the California ISO may require us to post $5MM in collateral today to cover deliveries to our California customers.  We are attempting to have them net this request with approximately $50MM of monies they owe us.  This payment will allow us to remain a scheduling coordinator for the first 5 days of December.  If we do not pay the ISO will decertify us and the utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) can immediately execute thier right to return our customers to utility service.  We have a transaction pending to sell a large portion of the contracts under the ISO that could be worth as much as $150MM. If the utilities return the customers to utility service we will not have a book to sell.

Mike or Jim, if I have missed anything or misstated anything, please reply to all.

I will keep you posted, but wanted to get the word to you as soon as I heard.

Thanks

Wade

It appears that the calculation and collateral call is pretty accurate.  Basically, EPMI had made significant purchases from the New England pool to fill the UI, NSTAR and CMP load (approx 1,000 mw/h).  Based on a 42 hour post petition calculation, ISO projects 30 day exposure at $39MM.  Since collateral is calculated at 3.5x, we would owe $137MM in collateral.  Unless we feel that our load/supply shape will change, as per the letter, we can request the ISO to reconsider the collateral amount.  Let me know your thoughts.

I called Molly Harris, she said there wasnt any one left in her dept. and that you should be able to help with the bonds for these companies, if there is someone else I should be contact, please let me know.  

Bill, attached is a list of bonds that our broker (John L. Wortham, LLP) received a notice of cancellation on from  Fireman's Fund and Safeco.   Please determine which obligations will be required in the future.  However our broker has offered assistance in establishing a replacement surety, but you may also want to investigate alternative form of acceptable security.  

Please let me know if you need copies or if there is anything I can do to help.  Thanks.

It is Greg's  understanding that the MD IOU's are planning to review Enron's creditworthiness  as an electricity and/or gas supplier.  In the event that the Commission  needs to take any expeditious action in this regard, we need to  know who to contact within your organization.

...more from Mr. Shurkis.  When we get the example, Gloria will make the comparison to current wording.  Also, do we expect 2001 revenues to be at the same level?  If not, perhaps we can negotiate a lower level.

I also need to discuss issues concerning the bonds Enron Power Marketing and
Energy Energy Services maintain for their electric licenses.

Neither bond meets the current wording requirements of the Commission.  They
both need updates to the wording for the priority of claims, the number of
days required to cancel the bond, and the number of months in which to make
a claim.  I will email or fax an example of the standard bond language.

Also, per Commission records, Enron Energy Services had revenues of
$38,704,087 for the last reported year, 2000.  Therefore, the Commission
expects a new bond of $3,870,409.  Per our records, a $250,000 bond is still
satisfactory for Enron Power Marketing.

1)  The G-IMB rate is the monthly gas adjustment rate published on their web page.  For Sept., it was $3.92 per Dth.  (Last winter, it exceeded $60 per Dth.)  The calculation under Sec 6 of the margin agreement would always use the most recently published price.

2)  Their current calculation shows a short of 76,000 Dth based on usage of 648,000 and delivery of 572,000.  Brent will fax me the actual documentation.

3)  Gas in storage is not pledgeable for this purpose.  They are saying storage gas is already required under the contract.

Brent told me there will definitely be a letter sent to Enron today spelling out the request and consequences for non-compliance by the 13th.  I need to know who all should receive this letter and proposed agreement.

Peoples Gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide "Adequate Assurances of Payment", as stated in their tariff.  They will continue to accept a parental guaranty, which is due no later than December 3 (and which Teresa says is being processed).  The amount at issue is about $40k.

However, they are sending me a letter that will say, if there is any further downgrade in our rating, they will immediately require a l/c or cash deposit.

I spoke with SDG&E's attorney on the question of why we received no notice on the switch of our customers to duel billing.  He told me that SDG&E did not believe notice was required under the tariff.  The link below is the ESP tariff, called Rule 25 for SDG&E. I also asked how it would be implemented.  The letter says the switch is effective 2 pm today.  He was not clear but it appears switches will take place on the billing date for each customer.  He did not know whether the switches will all be prospective or if they plan to go back to the last bill date.  I expressed surprise with the notion that they could go back in time.  He said he would have someone call me who is more knowledgable on the details.

I suspect this deposit may be the $19.4MM utility bond listed on the schedule I am attaching that I received from Credit.  We will continue to review the balance sheet, but the only "deposits" I have seen thus far are the deposits being made to the CPUC for disputed invoices from SCE.

Subject:	RE: deposits

My reading of a memo that SCE sent is that we have a deposit requirement of ~$23MM and that it needs to increase.  It wasn't clear whether that deposit was satisfied with cash, bond or LC. In all areas where we are billing our clients for power and T&D, we may have the opportunity to go to dual billing and receive deposits back, as well as to stop funding the PG&E escrow account.  I would imagine that the tariff provides for our deposits only to be netted against a deficiency in our T&D payments, where we are probably 100% current.

We need to aggregate where we think we have this opportunity and take action today.

Thanks - Dan

I am copying a lot of people on here to try and get as many sources thinking about this as possible.  Dan indicated to me that SCE appears to have a sizable deposit from us on hand (around $20MM) and is asking for more.  How can we trackdown/schedule out all of our deposits.  I would like to think we have them all in a deposit account on our balance sheet, but that is not likely (although Kim, Cindy and Mary Lynne should scour that).

Does anybody have any ideas?????

See Dave's message below.  You guys have to give me every bit of information that give us as much texture as to the criticalness of any payment coming out of your area.  We are having to clear EVERY payment through a central ENE clearing led by George Wasaff.  We have to describe in as much detail as possible why any payment made preserves value to the company.

Thanks for all your help and sorry this is so detailed.

Sure - I talked to Ed Sacks and there are some on the list that he is already working on.  I imagine that we have defaulted under the surety and the CP can now collect, but have not seen the actual notices yet.  I have asked Mary Grisaffi to forward them to Carol St. Clair for review.

Jim,
Are you all over this?  Is there a chance that we lose operations at these utilities before we can sell the markets?

I called Molly Harris, she said there wasnt any one left in her dept. and that you should be able to help with the bonds for these companies, if there is someone else I should be contact, please let me know.  

Bill, attached is a list of bonds that our broker (John L. Wortham, LLP) received a notice of cancellation on from  Fireman's Fund and Safeco.   Please determine which obligations will be required in the future.  However our broker has offered assistance in establishing a replacement surety, but you may also want to investigate alternative form of acceptable security.  

Please let me know if you need copies or if there is anything I can do to help.  Thanks.

Please find below the creditworthiness criteria for Alberta Pool.  I appreciate the help of Fino and Guillermo.
  

The credit worthiness in Alberta determines the trading limits for each participant in relation to its bond rating as follows: 
Rating		trading limit
AAA		$25,000,000
AA		$20,000,000
A		$15,000,000
BBB		$10,000,000
<BBB		$0

Trading limit is a defined term and means the maximum financial obligation to which a participant is or is expected to be owing the pool administrator.   I am currently investigating of the current levels of our trading levels as that will determine the action required.  

If a participant's financial obligations are expected to exceed the trading limit , the participant must provide a payment in advance or other form of financial security.  This security may be in the form of a bank guarantee, letter of guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposits drawn on a Canadian Chartered Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council in or for an amount determined by the pool administrator to be equal to the expected financial obligations in excess of the trading limit.

It is noteworthy that a rating with a plus or minus sign indicates the relative standing within the major rating categories (so A- is A).  An exception to this is a rating of BBB minus which falls in the <BBB category and therefore no unsecured credit is granted.  It is also noteworthy that participants are required to report any downgrading of the relevant corporate credit rating within 2 business days.

The Power Pool of Alberta requires participants to report any event of default for borrowed funds or a material adverse change in their financial position within 2 business days of said default or change.

Angela --

To follow up on our discusion about TX customers (e.g., Home Depot), are there any other customers that you are going to include in the sales effort (not including CA)?  I want to make sure that we include these customers in our analysis.

Thanks

I have confirmed with Mark Valvanis that BGE, for the time being, will not insist on an increase in collateral from $250k to $500k, as they were requesting.  The caveat is that we can not add additional customers.  Of course, if we anticipate any stop in flow of gas, they would like to know ASAP.  

I don't think any further action is needed for BGE as long as we flow gas.

The sales agreement provides that we may terminate the sales agreement immediately without any further obligation if we do not receive an allocation of market support generation.

An "event of default" under the sales agreement (e.g. filing of bankruptcy) will automatically establish an "Early Termination Date" and may trigger payment of an "Early Termination Payment".

I have not been able to find the provisions, yet, that would cause rescission of MSG.  I will have to continue that in the morning.

However, as a nonlawyer, an interesting question arises in terms of chicken or the egg.  It seems like it would be better to lose MSG and terminate the contract without any further financial obligation, than to be in default of the contract and pay an Early Termination Payment.  Will continue to research in the morning.

My reading of a memo that SCE sent is that we have a deposit requirement of ~$23MM and that it needs to increase.  It wasn't clear whether that deposit was satisfied with cash, bond or LC. In all areas where we are billing our clients for power and T&D, we may have the opportunity to go to dual billing and receive deposits back, as well as to stop funding the PG&E escrow account.  I would imagine that the tariff provides for our deposits only to be netted against a deficiency in our T&D payments, where we are probably 100% current.

We need to aggregate where we think we have this opportunity and take action today.

Thanks - Dan

I am copying a lot of people on here to try and get as many sources thinking about this as possible.  Dan indicated to me that SCE appears to have a sizable deposit from us on hand (around $20MM) and is asking for more.  How can we trackdown/schedule out all of our deposits.  I would like to think we have them all in a deposit account on our balance sheet, but that is not likely (although Kim, Cindy and Mary Lynne should scour that).

Does anybody have any ideas?????

I called Molly Harris, she said there wasnt any one left in her dept. and that you should be able to help with the bonds for these companies, if there is someone else I should be contact, please let me know.  

Bill, attached is a list of bonds that our broker (John L. Wortham, LLP) received a notice of cancellation on from  Fireman's Fund and Safeco.   Please determine which obligations will be required in the future.  However our broker has offered assistance in establishing a replacement surety, but you may also want to investigate alternative form of acceptable security.  

Please let me know if you need copies or if there is anything I can do to help.  Thanks.

Hello-

I have all of the pipeline info together for the East, Central and West regions, will forward to you and to Christi as soon as its formatted.  To whatever extent we plan to get re-established in the LDC programs, I could use some guidance from you and Steve as to how I can find that information.  

Would like to meet/conference call with you both as soon as is convenient for you to talk a little about on going activities during the period between now and the birth of "Newco".  Please let me know when you have some time and I'll get a call set up.

Thanks,
Suzanne

We are building a spreadsheet of agreements (transmission, gas transportation, pool, regional council, etc) that may be needed for a Newco Power Marketing Company to do business as a wholesale power merchant.  Attached is a spreadsheet that includes information about EPMI's transmission/pool/etc. agreements.  (use the "TRANSMISSION" spreadsheet).  Please use the current EPMI contracts listed as an example of the contracts that may be needed for NEWCO.  To start, please work on the areas listed below and email your updated spreadsheet to me.  "General..." should include any specific issues, such as AA rated company not required to provide any collateral, etc. (or parental guaranty needed, etc.) or contract must be approved by a regional committee, etc.  Include in "timing" column the estimated amount of time from request to completion of agreement and start of service:

Steve Walton and Alan Comnes -- West
Jeff Dasovich -- California
Charles Yeung -- ERCOT and other regional councils
Suzanne Calcagno -- Gas 
Marcus Nettelton -- PLEASE LET US KNOW THE AGREEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED


Susan and I will divide the rest of the spreadsheet and Bob and Harry could help with the pools that Marcus has not done. << File: Newcocontracts.XLS >> 

Please let me know the status of your review by COB Wed. and we'll proceed from there.  THANKS!!

Subject:	HOME DEPOT, ETC --- TEXAS CUSTOMERS GREATER THAN 1 MW

There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.

To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --

1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).

2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms =

TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  
Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.

3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.

4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.

5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.

6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.

Peoples Gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide "Adequate Assurances of Payment", as stated in their tariff.  They will continue to accept a parental guaranty, which is due no later than December 3 (and which Teresa says is being processed).  The amount at issue is about $40k.

However, they are sending me a letter that will say, if there is any further downgrade in our rating, they will immediately require a l/c or cash deposit.

Joseph,
I have checked our system on these accounts.

TXU did a manual cancel on 3538593, however on account 6171483 it switched
on 11/6.  We will do a manual drop to polr, however, I just want to give
you a heads up that you will be receiving an invoice on this account as it
was switched prior to the cancel request date.

Thanks

Gregg,

I don't want to step on anyone's toes here, but I think this is a critical issue and needs to be addressed.  I spoke to Calvin Yee at PG&E today and he brought this to my attention, since a deadline of tomorrow has been set in the letter.  I won't be in the office tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure this issue was raised.

PG&E specifically states in the attached letter that they will be comparing our final list of "valid account numbers against all Connect DASRs received since September 20, 2001."  My interpretation is that they are planning to reject any DASR's received since September 20th which are not on our list.

I will be looking at their list of accounts today.  If you need my input tomorrow, you can reach me on my cell phone at 713.408.4578.

Kimberly

Just talked to the PUC.  Seems that EES is up-to-date on its registration and it's only EEMC that's not current.  Wade will get the 1K to Jeanne Bennett, who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get.

HOWEVER, the PUC person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of EEMC's security bond that EEMC's security has been canceled.  She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.  She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info. Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?  We need to get info on that.

We should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the EES security bond hasn't also canceled.

Let me know if you have any questions,  and let me know what we find out about the bond, or if there's anything I can do to assist.

Thanks,
Jeff

The attached list details the California De-DASR status (by customer) as of this afternoon.  This list was prepared using the prior guidance of "...all customers pre-June/August with the exception of PacTel, IBM and UC/CSU".

Please note that there are two tabs to the spreadsheet.  fyi -- You need to scroll to the bottom of the EESO List to see those customers that are not "qued".

We are prepared to launch the De-DASR's but want to confirm via this message that everyone agrees with each individual customer status.

Please give me a call if you need additional information -- or have any edits or changes.

Thanks,

Evan

Team:

Following is a list of CA contracts that Jeremy and team are working on.

We need to assure ourselves that we are doing everything necessary to maintain the value in these deals and books of business until a sale is consummated or another decision is made.  This includes:

meter installations (Utility Transfer Dates - make sure to check CPUC and other requirements on time delta between when we signed the contract and the meter installation dates)
meter reading
billing
collections
etc.

Tranche 2 does include some deals from the PG&E book that we acquired.  This will / does have some impact on the Lodestar discussions that we had this morning.

As we discussed yesterday afternoon and this morning, let's lock this down this afternoon and make sure that critical operations & vendors are addressed in a timeframe that is appropriate to preserve and enhance the value in the CA portfolio.

Esmerelda - please set up a meeting at 2PM or 3PM today with the "to's" in this memo and any "cc" that would like to attend.

Thanks - Dan

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

Peoples Gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide "Adequate Assurances of Payment", as stated in their tariff.  They will continue to accept a parental guaranty, which is due no later than December 3 (and which Teresa says is being processed).  The amount at issue is about $40k.

However, they are sending me a letter that will say, if there is any further downgrade in our rating, they will immediately require a l/c or cash deposit.

I do not see any reason to pursue a license to do business anywhere at this time.  I also do not think we need to suspend anything, we should withdraw, unless the suspension is free and carries no risks.

The Virginia Corp. Commission is about to reject EES's application for a retail gas license and revoke EEMC's license.  My recommendation is that we should withdraw (without prejudice) EES's pending application and agree to suspend EEMC's license, which could be reinstated when/if we meet credit requirements.  The filing will be made by Wed. COB unless anyone disagrees.  Please call w/ questions.

Jim, I have pulled the tariff language on credit for the pipelines in this report.  (If you want to see it, I'll leave it in my chair.  I'm off to the doctor for the rest of the day.)   Monica says they are putting together information on markets affected, etc. but that won't be ready til later.

Also, Superty's group is pulling together information for ENA.  I've only traded voice mails with him and Jeff Gossett, but I asked Bob to let me have a copy of it.  Don't know when it will be done.

I'll check my voice mail later, and my e-mail when I get home.  If you have any questions, you can contact me thusly.

Who in ENA leadership could we talk with about finding a "champion" for Gus Engheim (environmental permitting), Bob Frank and Harry Kingerski?  Steve Kean is talking to Ben Jacoby about Gus.  Who else - maybe Scott Neal on gas for Harry Kingerski and Bob Frank?


Let me know.

We received the attached letter from SoCal Gas late this afternoon.  They are requesting that Enron execute the Supplemental Margin Agreement by COB Tuesday, the 13th, or possibly face termination from their marketers' program.   We will reassemble the folks who've been working on this on Monday.

By "these customers" you mean the non-mass market - ie, Home Depot?

Subject:	HOME DEPOT, ETC --- TEXAS CUSTOMERS GREATER THAN 1 MW

There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.

To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --

1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).

2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms =

TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  
Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.

3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.

4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.

5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.

6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.

The attached list details the California De-DASR status (by customer) as of this afternoon.  This list was prepared using the prior guidance of "...all customers pre-June/August with the exception of PacTel, IBM and UC/CSU".

Please note that there are two tabs to the spreadsheet.  fyi -- You need to scroll to the bottom of the EESO List to see those customers that are not "qued".

We are prepared to launch the De-DASR's but want to confirm via this message that everyone agrees with each individual customer status.

Please give me a call if you need additional information -- or have any edits or changes.

Thanks,

Evan

Enron Energy Marketing Corp.("EEMC") has bonds posted with the ISO New England ("ISO-NE") with a value of $14,423,297.39. I am led to believe that this entity is an Enron Energy Services, Inc. ("EESI") entity which bought some assets from PG&E, possibly.

In order to maximise our credit flexibility and minimise our collateral obligations would you be kind enough to advise as to whether this entity is trading or requires NEPOOL to fulfill any obligations to customers and if not, we would want to cancel the bond.

If indeed the bond is needed, could you see if there is a way to transfer the obligations which require the bond to be in place for EEMC, from EEMC to EESI, in order that we can position ourselves to cancel the bond. In respect of any such transfer we would want to ensure that there was no increase in the obligation upon EESI as to the amount of the bonds required to be posted. EESI currently has $20,000,000 in bonds posted with ISO-NE. 
	
If ISO-NE required the amount of the bonds to be increased, in the event that the obligations of EEMC were transferred to EESI, Travis, please could you advise as to whether the DIP financing agreements will permit us to issue new bonds, if the net effect was to reduce the amount of bonds issued as between all Enron entities.

Jim -

Below is a copy of the schedule we sent to APX this am.  After receiving the info, I spoke with APX (Rosalie and Eric).  They said that they had discussed the schedule with ERCOT (Cheryl Mosely) and that because we do not have a physical supply source that they actually could not submit a schedule to ERCOT.  ERCOT would like to be notified, however, so that they could anticipate load and that we would be billed the ERCOT Imbalance market prices.

We have also sent Monday's schedule to APX and they plan to handle the same way.  I think this is ok for now, however, I think it would be best if we could de-DASR Lockheed and Packaged Ice as soon as possible.   That way we would not have to submit a schedule at all - what are your thoughts?  Evan, how long would this take?

FYI.  The PUC's rule under which Enron Energy Sservices was certified as an
REP in Texas requires that a REP notify the Commission of any petition in
bankruptcy within 10 days of the filing.  In addition, 10-day notification
is required for any material change in the financial requirements presented
by a REP pursuant to which its application for REP certification was
approved.  A REP has 30 days to notify the Commission of any change in the
technical conditions presented in its application.  Finally, a REP may not
cease operations as a REP without prior notice to the Commission, as well as
to customers and any other affected persons (such as the T&D utility, etc.).

Please let me know if we can assist Enron in any of these filings, and give
me a call if you have any questions.  The relevant rule governing these
requirements is PUC Substantive Rule 25.107.

I want to make sure this has hit your radar screen.  Please contact Juan if you think we can be of any help in resolving this.  As I understand it, they have given us until the end of the week.

Rogers, 

I just had a conversation with Mike Mackles & Phil Gootee with NYISO's Credit Department regarding advise on updating our Letter of Guarantee.  And, I learned that they have already talked to Enron Corp's Credit Department, Bill Bradford and Tracy Ngo.  NYISO advised me to contact our credit department for details of their conversation.  The overview that NYISO did give me was that our Letter of Guarantee needs to be replaced by the end of this week due to our downgrade of Credit Rating.  We had $1.5 Million of Credit with NYISO, $1 Million for Energy and $0.5 for ICAP.  That number will change significantly as our Physical Load increases within the next couple of months.  Let us stay ontop of this issue, for it has significant impact on our business.

I spoke to Texas PUC staff and the have informed us that we should contact Martha Hinkle (contact details below) and she will work with Enron on exactly how things needs to be handled and filed.  We also need to address this for both Enron Energy Services and Enron Power Marketing Inc, because they are both registered REPs.  They would also like to know how many customers we have signed up for January delivery, what customer classes they are in and they would like this information by service territory.    Please let me know if there is anything I can do or if you have any questions.  You can reach me by pager tomorrow and I will be in my office on Friday.  Thanks.

Nancy,
To memorialize our phone conversation, you indicated that you will have a
better idea of a contact person for PUC staff following your 4 pm conference
call.  You expect to have contact info for both Enron Energy Services and
Enron Power Marketing.  Those people should followup with Martha Hinkle,
Director of Financial Review here at the Commission.  Her phone number is
512-936-7425 or e-mail to martha.hinkle@puc.state.tx.us.

Thanks.

Jim:

Sorry we have played phone-tag.

The couple issues I wanted to talk with you about are 1) the reference in
your Dec 4 letter regarding re-enrolling customers for switching to Enron,
and 2) the listing of Massachusetts Electric as a creditor in Enron's
bankruptcy filing.

The pending switches of the 1013 customer accounts were canceled based upon
our conversation last week.  This does not put them on 'hold' for a later
switch, since that is not feasible or appropriate.  The customers simply
remain on their former rate (Default Service or Standard Offer) until they
choose otherwise.  When/If Enron wishes to re-initiate a switch for the
customers, you would need to send through the appropriate EDI switch
transaction as usual.  If the customer has not yet chosen another supplier,
the switch would be processed.  We assume you'd take care of any contract
updating that needed to be addressed with the customers, as that is a matter
between you and them.  Hope that clarifies.  Please let me know if
questions.

Have you been able to identify someone in the financial area that could
answer some questions on the calculations of the amounts listed under the
creditor section of the bankruptcy filing?  We'd like to speak with someone
ASAP.  Thanks.

Jim - I am in the process of reviewing many of EES' utility agreements for the northeast.  The Application to Supply Gas under Schedule DSG with BGE signed 6/5/95 requires EES to notify BGE of any deterioration in its creditworthiness or any assignment made for the benefit of creditors within the month such deterioration or assignment occurs.

I will let you know if I find anything else of note.  Give me a call if you have any questions.

Will

Harry - At this point we just now need to verify their DDR or Design Day Requirement of 10,473 mmbtus per day is reasonable. This is what they are saying is their max daily delivery.  I have left a message for Craig to verify this.  Teresa

Molly - WGL's tariff allows them to demand collateral acceptable to them (cash, l/c, bonds) if we do not meet their credit qualifications (pp. 42-43 of MD tariff), which we don't.  The security requirement they have calculated (contained in Craig's earlier e-mail) of $1.0 million follows a process that is used for all gas marketers and was approved through the "Gas Roundtable" in MD, a cross-sectional group of industry players in MD.  In other words, the MD Commission would uphold this calculation.

I talked to Frank Donnelly, financing director, and Shelley Jennings, corporate treasurer, of WGL about the calculation.  Nearly all of the collateral is related to "delivery risk", which is 60 days of peak day usage, reduced by about 50%, priced at a forward NYMEX price.  This is not terribly unreasonable, and as I say, it would be acceptable to the MD PSC.

I told Frank and Shelly we'd let them know, one way or another, our response by this Friday.  Thanks.

Molly & Teresa,

Harry Kingerski suggested I forward this issue to you.  WGL has a $1.1 bond requirement due on 11/30.  Mary Grisaffi (RAC) tried to obtain a bond last week and was unsuccessful due to Enron's credit rating.

Below are the attached files describing the bond requirement and calculation.  WGL's POC is Francis 
Donelly at (202) 624-6062.  Harry is researching the tariff to determine the validity of this requirement.

Please contact me if you have any questions and/or require further information.


Thanks,

Craig

John - this note is to confirm our earlier discussion today.  Given that pending switches to Enron retail service must be processed or withdrawn, Enron requests that you withdraw any such pending requests for switch to Enron retail service.  I understand these customers will be tracked and the information made available to CSC or will be sent directly back to Enron.

Enron Energy Marketing Corp.("EEMC") has bonds posted with the ISO New England ("ISO-NE") with a value of $14,423,297.39. I am led to believe that this entity is an Enron Energy Services, Inc. ("EESI") entity which bought some assets from PG&E, possibly.

In order to maximise our credit flexibility and minimise our collateral obligations would you be kind enough to advise as to whether this entity is trading or requires NEPOOL to fulfill any obligations to customers and if not, we would want to cancel the bond.

If indeed the bond is needed, could you see if there is a way to transfer the obligations which require the bond to be in place for EEMC, from EEMC to EESI, in order that we can position ourselves to cancel the bond. In respect of any such transfer we would want to ensure that there was no increase in the obligation upon EESI as to the amount of the bonds required to be posted. EESI currently has $20,000,000 in bonds posted with ISO-NE. 
	
If ISO-NE required the amount of the bonds to be increased, in the event that the obligations of EEMC were transferred to EESI, Travis, please could you advise as to whether the DIP financing agreements will permit us to issue new bonds, if the net effect was to reduce the amount of bonds issued as between all Enron entities.
	
	
Marcus

Subject:	SDG&E Conversation

I spoke with SDG&E's attorney on the question of why we received no notice on the switch of our customers to duel billing.  He told me that SDG&E did not believe notice was required under the tariff.  The link below is the ESP tariff, called Rule 25 for SDG&E. I also asked how it would be implemented.  The letter says the switch is effective 2 pm today.  He was not clear but it appears switches will take place on the billing date for each customer.  He did not know whether the switches will all be prospective or if they plan to go back to the last bill date.  I expressed surprise with the notion that they could go back in time.  He said he would have someone call me who is more knowledgable on the details.

Attached is a draft letter from Jim Steffes to the NEPOOL Participants' Committee telling them why termination of Enron is not appropriate at this point.  Please let me know your comments.  If we're going to submit it, we need to do so by 9:00 am EST tomorrow morning.

Thanks

Subject:	IMPORTANT: Illinois - Creditworthiness Issues

Unlike TX, creditworthiness standards for Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers (ARES) in IL is not uniform accross utility lines. The creditworthiness standards vary by utility, and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES. However, the single billing option (SBO) has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria. All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative.

Enron's Credit Rating of BBB(S&P), and Baa2(Moody's)
General Creditworthiness: Under Section 451.50 Subchapter C of the IL Admin. Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.

Registration Under SubPart B:
EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications
	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB- (Duff 	& Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or

	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 
	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES' revenue for last fiscal year; or
	
	3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES's revenue for the last fiscal year; or

	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES' contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or
	
	5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an "A" rated financial 	insitution; or
	
	6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.

Enron's Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&P) and Baa2 (Moody's), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.

IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES's ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.

Single Bill Option:
Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:
	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO

	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an "A" rating

	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB-(duff &Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)
	
	4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.
Enron's Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp's current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. 

Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.

IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.

Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)
Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month's estimated IFC charges for all EES' customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES' customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.

If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.

IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP's service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications.

To follow-up on NEPOOL matters --

Last week, the NEPOOL Members Comm did not take any action against Enron. 

I received a call today (that I intend to return tomorrow) from Dave Doot - NEPOOL Secretary.  He would like to have a phone call with Enron's attorneys and credit people to figure out how to manage our credit issues going forward.  The reason there was no action last week was because NEPOOL hoped that they could work something out.  I do not know what the bills are for EES/EEMC/EPMI?

I will call Dave Doot and find a good time for later this week when I can arranage a call with the appropriate people.

Call with any other questions.

Jim

Wade,
You need to get this information into the Forecast system.  
FYI, the Mellon/Key lockboxes won't be moved (at least not right now) only Bank of America.

Subject: Preliminary EES Burn Schedule


To meet Treasury's requirement for day ahead notice of funding requirements, and also cash forecasts required by the courts, I have put together the attached very simple daily burn schedule for the balance of December.  I have a couple of key assumptions:
 
1.  We will continue to pay CAISO through December (note the actual amount is a moving target and we will try and notice of any changes as soon as we know of them).  We will pay NYISO when it comes up again and we will not fund ERCOT anymore.  At this point I am not aware of any other pre-payment obligation or, for that matter, post-payment in any other jurisdiction (i.e., all other contracts are being terminated/turned back).  Please advise if this is inaccurate.  I have heard for gas we may be OK through December, Don please advise.
 
2.  I have not factored in any EES receipts from customers yet.  We are working on a forecast, but since all lockboxes are being moved I assume significant delays and wanted to focus on disbursements.
 
3.  We will fund EFS daily.  I did assume they would have some receipts.  THEA/STEVE, please true-up the disbursments based on whatever better data you have (esp. around pay dates) and give me a better idea about receipts.
 
4.  I assume I am not going to incur any other "material" trade payables other than those listed.  Especially that would be due in next 30 days.
 
Mary and Ray, unless you hear otherwise from me, assume the scheduled amounts for Wed. and Thursday are good.
