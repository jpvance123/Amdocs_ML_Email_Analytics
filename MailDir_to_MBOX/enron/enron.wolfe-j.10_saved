Mark your calendar-- 
	the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is moving to a new administrator!

In preparation, here are a few things you need to remember.

For All Savings Plan participants, Friday, October 19 at 3:00pm CST will be the last day to:
?	Request a loan or a loan payoff so that funds can be allocated or distributed in time.
?	Request a withdrawal (In-service or Hardship).

For SDA Participants, Friday, October 19 at 3:00pm CST will be your last day to:
?	Make trades in your Schwab SDA brokerage account so that we can move your holdings in-kind. 
?	Re-invest any Schwab mutual funds into your choice of funds  - the default will be your money market fund.

Other transactions, such as Contribution Rate Changes and Investment Fund Transfers, will continue until 3:00pm CST on October 26.  

EnronBenefits... keeping pace with your lifestyle.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Please see the attached chart outlining our Confirmation process.  This is the same process that Barry Tycholiz implemented for Origination.  I think it is a great way to verify our booking process.  

Please use the trading books that Anne Bike passed out yesterday.

I'm always hanging out...


of my pants!

That said, perhaps I can get more casual...
It's tough for me to get away for lunch, with my new gig, but
your companionship is the break that refreshes. We need
some quality time.

Also, I've heard from Ellwanger, who is cleaning boats. He offered me
a raw, water washdown. And I don't own a boat.

       A language instructor was explaining to her class that French nouns,
       unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically
       designated as masculine or feminine.
       "House," in French, is feminine - "la maison."
       "Pencil," in French, is masculine - "le crayon."
       One puzzled student asked, "What gender is computer?"
       The teacher did not know, and the word wasn't in her French
       dictionary. So for fun she split the class into two groups appropriately
      enough, by gender, and asked them to decide whether "computer" should be a
      masculine or feminine noun. Both groups were required to give four
      reasons for their recommendation.
        The men's group decided that computers should
        definitely be of the feminine gender ("la computer"), because:
         1. No one but their creator understands their
            internal logic;
         2. The native language they use to communicate with
            other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else
         3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long-term
            memory for possible later retrieve; and
         4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find
            yourself  spending half your pay check on accessories for it.
       The women's group, however, concluded that computers
       should be masculine ("le computer"), because:
        1. In order to do anything with them, you have to
           turn them on
        2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves
        3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but
           half the time they are the problem; and
        4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if
           you'd waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:

Dave,

What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load.
It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet.
If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.

Thanks,
Jason

Hey Jason,
 What have you been up to? We haven't heard from you in quite awhile.
 I took some pictures of Mikayl on his birthday, so I'll have Dad scan them
for me.
 One of the babysitter's kids has strep throat so we hope Mikayl doesn't get
it. He has a cold now. Jill stopped by here on her way to the sitter's so I
saw Mikayl for a minute. He was his cheerful self depite the cold.
 Wesclin started their football program this year, they're having a parade
and bonfire for homecoming for the first time. We may go to town to watch
the parade.
 Better go and feed your fat feline sister and the tiny one.
Love, Mom

   popinjay \POP-in-jay\, noun: 
   A vain and talkative person. 
     One  popinjay  shrieking from the left and another from the 
     right  about  last  week's  headlines  is  not the whole of 
     Washington's   political   dramas.  Occasionally,  American 
     politics is more complicated and more momentous. 
     --R.  Emmett  Tyrrell,  Jr., "Feds Go Drug Crazy," American 
     Spectator, May 26, 2000 
     A  writer  who  appreciates  the  seriousness of writing so 
     little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally 
     educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay. 
     --Ernest Hemingway, [1]Death in the Afternoon 
     The  dignified, high density of personality of [Clark Gable 
     and   Humphrey  Bogart]  is  completely  missing  from  our 
     popinjay contemporary actors. 
     --Camille Paglia, [2]Salon, March 1998 
     _________________________________________________________ 
   Popinjay  is  from  Middle  English papejay, popingay, meaning 
   "parrot,"  from  Old  French papegai, deriving ultimately from 
   Arabic babagha.

Hi Jason, 
Tried to call you, but could't get through at 503.464.8637.  Is that the right number?  Here's some suggestions on how to access the data you want:
POINTS LIST:  My point list is pretty out of date.  If you have access to NW Passage, you can get to a current list by logging in, go to "EBB", then "Point Capacity", then hit refresh.  If you want to look at the capacity of a specific point, highlight the point and hit "Point Capacity".
SCHEDULED POINT VOLUMES:  You can look at scheduled volumes at all points, including the "zones" that we were talking about, via the scheduling screen.  You must be logged into NW Passage.  Go to the "Noms" Section, then the "Scheduling" window.  Click on the "Meter" radio button at the upper left and fill in the desired date or date range.  Hit "Refresh" and the point volumes should pop up and look similar to the view scheduling screen.  You have the option to save this information into a spreadsheet as well as look at volumes for a range of dates.  This should give you the same data as the unutilized capacity report with the addition of the other "zone" and throughput volumes.  It looks like a pretty comprehensive list of active points as well.  The scheduling screen is pretty powerful and has a lot of other features as well... you might play around with it or call me to find out what else it can do.
Please call me if you have any questions. 
Thanks, 
Wes Kida

We will be implementing an additional confirm process going forward.  All broker deals will be booked by Risk and placed in TAGG to generate a confirmation.  Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the Enron trader will sign off on the confirm.  All broker deals will be handled this way.

Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region.  This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly.

Anne, please communicate this to your group.

Thanks,
Mike

Jason, 

Maybe this will clear things up a little:

The monthly data (files ending w/ US) contain monthly data submitted by those respondents required to file monthly survey responses, and ESTIMATES for those other respondents required only to submit one annual survey response.  The data for those files, therefore, also include - for each State - a record for utility ID = "99999" and plant code = "9999" containing data values which represent the arithmetic differences between the "estimated" State totals and the sum of the net generation, consumption, and ending stocks data reported by the respondents to the Form EIA-759. 
The 2001 file will be a "year-to-date" file and is in this Monthly format until the data for the final month is finalized. 

The other files (Annual Data, files ending w/ YR) contain monthly data submitted by those respondents required to file monthly survey responses, and annual data for those other respondents required to only submit one annual survey response. No estimation procedures are involved. 

This only applies to the 759 (Utility) forms.  If you notice, there are only YR files for F759 forms. 

Also, keep in mind that for the 900 Forms before year 2001, the values are in Kwh and not Mwh.  To convert Kwh to MW, divide by 24 hours, 31 days, and 1000...not that you care about generation anyways, but just in case...

Got it?  Hope this helps.  If you need anything else, call this baller up here.   

Have fun in Portland,
J

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Guys:  We want to change the curve mappings for KERN/LasVegas from SOCAL to PG&E/Topock.  However, there are a few term deals that will be affected when we make the change.

Jason:  I tried to look at the deals to tell you more about them, but we do not have access to Canadian deals.  Can you check with the Canadian trader on these three deals to see if we can change the curves ?

452375
459155
434877

Brain:  Can you also have some one run this down from your end.

Thanks

Anne,

Perhaps, but there are three deals out there with October and forward activity. The deals however; are done by Petro-Canada - BC and
Petro-Canada Hydrocarbons - BC. The deal numbers are 452375, 459155, and 434877.
Let me know what you decide.

Receipts at Deer Island serve year-round industrial loads and a small amount
of mostly heating season residential loads, but are augmented considerably
during the off-peak months (May-October) by storage injection requirements
at Mist.

Jim,

I was wondering if you could provide any info on the Deer Island meter off
NWPL (470)? It is a fair amount of load in the area, and I was just curious
if this was mostly residential, or if there is a plant I am unaware of.  I
appreciate whatever help you can provide.  Thanks,

Over the past few weeks we have held several "Breakfast Club" meetings to update members of the Program and business units leaders on the results of the recent Program Survey, to discuss several initiatives we have underway, and to provide an opportunity for Q&A.  

I want to invite any of you who may not have been able to attend one of these four meetings, to a final meeting on Tuesday, October 30.  The meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A continental breakfast will be provided. 

Because space in this room is limited, please rsvp to my assistant Maxine Levingston by 12:00 noon on Monday, October 29.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com> <<mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com>>.

Best regards,
Billy Lemmons

Jason, 
Attached is the list of points with location information.  
Also, in response to your other questions, Florida River is BP's gas processing plant in La Plata County, CO.  Elmore is a power generation plant (Idaho Power) and Southend balancing is a logical point for NWP use.  
Let me know if you need additional information. 
Thanks,

Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United
States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have
the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm
the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information
I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,

I recently won two of your auctions. One is 5 posters, one is 18. I am
excited
about these posters, but I have a couple questions. Are the 5 posters in
the first
set completely included in the set of 18? If so, is it possible to get
any non-duplicates
that you may own in the same theme that will not be doubled up in these
sets?

Thanks for the product.
Jason

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Alright, which one of you sent the "Just a Tip" thing? I haven't opened it
yet. Is it ok to open at work? I'm serious. This is a small place, and I

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Jason, 
What kind of attitude is that, you should always be will to party with friends.  We will set another day just in case but getting a lot of folks together at one time is a challenge.
How are things at Enron?  You going to be okay?

   The original plan was to try and meet this week but the response has 
   been light.  From the few that did respond (which I thank for the 
   feedback) the consensus was to try and meet on Thursday but no location 
   was picked.  I will unfortunately be out of town this Thursday and 
   Friday on business.  If you guys still want to get together use the 
   Reply to All and set up a time and place.  It has been a long time since 
   most of us have tossed back a few brewskies together so don't let my

Hey. Did you know that Woody Williams was a shortstop for the Cougars back
in the 80's? How cool is that? Not only is he a bad ass that beats the Big
Unit in the playoffs, but he's one of us.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Subject: It's all about the tribe... 
October 14, 2001 
In My Tribe 
By ETHAN WATTERS 
It may be true that 'never marrieds' are saving themselves for something 
better. They may also be saving the institution of marriage while they're at 
it. 
You may be like me: between the ages of 25 and 39, single, a 
college-educated city dweller. If so, you may have also had the unpleasant 
experience of discovering that you have been identified (by the U.S. Census 
Bureau, no less) as one of the fastest-growing groups in America -- the 
''never marrieds.'' In less than 30 years, the number of never-marrieds has 
more than doubled, apparently pushing back the median age of marriage to the 
oldest it has been in our country's history -- about 25 years for women and 
27 for men. 
As if the connotation of ''never married'' weren't negative enough, the 
vilification of our group has been swift and shrill. These statistics prove 
a ''titanic loss of family values,'' according to The Washington Times. An 
article in Time magazine asked whether ''picky'' women were ''denying 
themselves and society the benefits of marriage'' and in the process kicking 
off ''an outbreak of 'Sex and the City' promiscuity.'' In a study on 
marriage conducted at Rutgers University, researchers say the ''social 
glue'' of the family is at stake, adding ominously that ''crime rates . . . 
are highly correlated with a large percentage of unmarried young males.'' 
Although I never planned it, I can tell you how I became a never-married. 
Thirteen years ago, I moved to San Francisco for what I assumed was a brief 
transition period between college and marriage. The problem was, I wasn't 
just looking for an appropriate spouse. To use the language of the Rutgers 
researchers, I was ''soul-mate searching.'' Like 94 percent of 
never-marrieds from 20 to 29, I, too, agree with the statement ''When you 
marry, you want your spouse to be your soul mate first and foremost.'' This 
?ber-romantic view is something new. In a 1965 survey, fully three out of 
four college women said they'd marry a man they didn't love if he fit their 
criteria in every other way. I discovered along with my friends that finding 
that soul mate wasn't easy. Girlfriends came and went, as did jobs and 
apartments. The constant in my life -- by default, not by plan -- became a 
loose group of friends. After a few years, that group's membership and 
routines began to solidify. We met weekly for dinner at a neighborhood 
restaurant. We traveled together, moved one another's furniture, painted one 
another's apartments, cheered one another on at sporting events and 
open-mike nights. One day I discovered that the transition period I thought 
I was living wasn't a transition period at all. Something real and important 
had grown there. I belonged to an urban tribe. 
I use the word ''tribe'' quite literally here: this is a tight group, with 
unspoken roles and hierarchies, whose members think of each other as ''us'' 
and the rest of the world as ''them.'' This bond is clearest in times of 
trouble. After earthquakes (or the recent terrorist strikes), my instinct to 
huddle with and protect my group is no different from what I'd feel for my 
family. 
Once I identified this in my own life, I began to see tribes everywhere I 
looked: a house of ex-sorority women in Philadelphia, a team of 
ultimate-frisbee players in Boston and groups of musicians in Austin, Tex. 
Cities, I've come to believe, aren't emotional wastelands where fragile 
individuals with arrested development mope around self-indulgently searching 
for true love. There are rich landscapes filled with urban tribes. 
So what does it mean that we've quietly added the tribe years as a 
developmental stage to adulthood? Because our friends in the tribe hold us 
responsible for our actions, I doubt it will mean a wild swing toward 
promiscuity or crime. Tribal behavior does not prove a loss of ''family 
values.'' It is a fresh expression of them. 
It is true, though, that marriage and the tribe are at odds. As many 
ex-girlfriends will ruefully tell you, loyalty to the tribe can wreak havoc 
on romantic relationships. Not surprisingly, marriage usually signals the 
beginning of the end of tribal membership. From inside the group, marriage 
can seem like a risky gambit. When members of our tribe choose to get 
married, the rest of us talk about them with grave concern, as if they've 
joined a religion that requires them to live in a guarded compound. 
But we also know that the urban tribe can't exist forever. Those of us who 
have entered our mid-30's find ourselves feeling vaguely as if we're living 
in the latter episodes of ''Seinfeld'' or ''Friends,'' as if the plot lines 
of our lives have begun to wear thin. 
So, although tribe membership may delay marriage, that is where most of us 
are still heading. And it turns out there may be some good news when we get 
there. Divorce rates have leveled off. Tim Heaton, a sociologist at Brigham 
Young University, says he believes he knows why. In a paper to be published 
next year, he argues that it is because people are getting married later. 
Could it be that we who have been biding our time in happy tribes are now 
actually grown up enough to understand what we need in a mate? What a 
fantastic twist -- we ''never marrieds'' may end up revitalizing the very 
institution we've supposedly been undermining. 
And there's another dynamic worth considering. Those of us who find it so 
hard to leave our tribes will not choose marriage blithely, as if it is the 
inevitable next step in our lives, the way middle-class high-school kids 
choose college. When we go to the altar, we will be sacrificing something 
precious. In that sacrifice, we may begin to learn to treat our marriages 
with the reverence they need to survive.

      Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work
   e-mail.
      I'm
      doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the
   market
      for
      a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your
   quest
      for a
      Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of unemployment,
   I
      don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage.
   Tara
      and I
      will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan on
      throwing
      back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and Beth
      together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin and
   get
      as
      accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre. Go
      Cards!

A man walks out of a bar, stumbling back and forth with a key in his hand. A cop on the beat sees him and approaches. "Can I help you sir?" 
"Yesssh!Ssssshomebody ssshtole my car!" the man replies. The cop asks, "Where was the car the last time you saw it?" "It wassssat the end of thissshkey!" the man replies.About that time the Officer looks down to see that the man's weineris hanging out of his fly for all theworld to see. He asks the man, "Sir, are you aware that you are exposing yourself?" Momentarily confused, the drunk looks down woefully at his crotch, and, without missing a beat, blurtsout "SON-OF-A-BITCH...

Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update- US Attacks Afghanistan #2
Importance:	High

Update below on ground campaign strategy & timing, as well as mounting pressures on Saudi and Pakistani governments. Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway.   There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYC--we are investigating and will update as soon as possible.

Call with questions.

RJ

1.	Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate

With a target list thinner than for Kosovo, results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited.   But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up, the next phase of search and destroy ground raids, carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces, could be imminent.   Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun.   All our indications are that the US will commit a light division (up to 10,000 troops) and the UK a brigade (about 3,500).   This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised.  More stories along this line may become public over the weekend, even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action.

Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides, joining the Taleban against the foreign invader.   But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way.   There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out.  And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives - which they have been so far - the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited.

When the ground assault starts, from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan, the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air.   Such action will be fast and high risk, without much media coverage (with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen).   If the Taleban can be thus loosened, special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda, led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi.  Depending on how long this takes, there is hope among allied planners that "reasonable elements" in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broad-based coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision.   The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer.

2.	Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure

Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom.   The tally of small, isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount.   We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaeda's coffers are now being 'advised' to do so, on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Laden's future displeasure.

Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullah's decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake.  The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see.   Blair was particularly galled by Abdullah's blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone, particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement.

3.	Pakistan Holding Steady- For Now

Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage.   Even in Peshawar we are told that 'playing to the cameras' has become a distinct element of the protest.   Musharraf meanwhile, having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees, maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks.  Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation - just.

4.	Key Issue for U.S. and Arab allies- Wider War?

There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching.   This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan, but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan, the Gulf including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy.   Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it.   As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan, the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable.   But if it were to spill over, there could be difficulties for these regimes.

 You people ALLLL SUCK!  I can't play because I have a really tough job that would leave any of you as shells of the humans you think you are.  YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT PRESSURE I'M UNDER!  So go on with your little game, while I subsist on cruel PF Chang delivery and some bits of blow snorted off a stripper's ass.
