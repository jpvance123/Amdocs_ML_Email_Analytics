Louise, given the number of declines, is there any latitude in moving up the Canadian Headcount. I believe we cut very deep on the 1st go round. Specifically, there is  a couple of analysts and one manager on the commercial side and on the non-commercial side we'd like to have at least one if not two admins for answering the phones (Admins are roughly U.S. $15K/annum and ours are extremely good). We still might come in under our initial headcount given the decline probabilities, but I would like to offer additional jobs asap as opposed to waiting for responses.

John:

I have not found anyone who was trying to renew these contracts.  I am meeting with IHS on Thursday so I will make sure we add Accumap.  How many user of Accumap will you need?  I will forward the cost to you prior to sending the contracts to UBS.  

Do you know who managed the contracts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS or ESBI so that I can gather contact information and begin the contract management of these applications.

Thanks,

Danielle

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.

The contracts might have been from Calgary, I just don't know if anyone from Calgary is talking with the contracts group from UBS?
Does anyone know?

1 user of accumap

 I'll look into the other issues, I just thought that you may know who may be handling it, we may just do it directly from Calgary

John:

I have not found anyone who was trying to renew these contracts.  I am meeting with IHS on Thursday so I will make sure we add Accumap.  How many user of Accumap will you need?  I will forward the cost to you prior to sending the contracts to UBS.  

Do you know who managed the contracts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS or ESBI so that I can gather contact information and begin the contract management of these applications.

Thanks,

Danielle

John:

Here are the contracts we are currently creating with UBS.  Please verify that we have not missed any applications/publications or subscriptions.  

Highlight in Red the systems you will need and mark the priority from 1-5,  1 being critical.


Thank you,

Danielle

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

John:

I have IHS listed on the spreadsheet.  It was not in yellow because we are already talking with IHS. 

For nova, oasis and power pool of alberta I had added to the list because I assumed they needed to be addressed I will remove them from the list??

I didn't see accumap added to the new list that was sent by chris behney,

the nova, oasis and power pool of alberta accounts that were added in yellow were inappropriately added as these are 
not data sources that require purchasing, they are simply accounts to set-up much like a membership account

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

d  I started fly fishing two years ago out of what some  would call the bat=
tle of the sexes. I had taken an "old" boyfriend  backpacking; he brought a=
long a fly rod. I think he had just started  fly fishing. I tried it out af=
ter watching him for a while and I  liked it. It reminded me of Tai Chi and=
 meditation - flowing water,  fresh air - it felt so natural.    So when we=
 returned from our trip  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to fly fish. He =
replied,  "You don't know how." Instantly the tomboy in me rose to the  cha=
llenge. Growing up with three brothers, it was a  conditioned response. I h=
ad to prove to this boy that I could  indeed fly fish if I wanted to.  So I=
 said, "I'll  learn." And a few weeks later an old timer in Arizona gave me=
  an old rod, a Reel O'Matic and my first casting lesson. I was  hooked and=
 ready to prove myself to the guys.  With a  good year of fishing under my =
belt, I found myself at the  Santa Ynez River early one morning; no one aro=
und yet, big  pools, bubbling water, a golden eagle cruising up the river, =
 silence. I was fishing a hole with trout and smallmouth bass  in it. All a=
lone, my mind wandered, and I was soon asking  myself whether or not I trul=
y enjoyed fishing, or whether I  was just trying to be better than the boys=
. I contemplated  this thought while casting, the line unrolling rhythmical=
ly on  each forward and back cast. And I felt so very present, in the  now,=
 in peaceful solitude with my world, breathing deep and  then? Fish on!  An=
d the answer was yes. I love this. I  love the way I feel after a day of fi=
shing, as though I had  spent the whole day meditating. I feel fresh and li=
ke a kid  again, all sun-baked and dirty after a day rock hopping up a  cre=
ek. I enjoy most the solitude. Even if I fish with a buddy,  I am still jus=
t with myself, my rod and the cast, trying to  come up with a recipe for ca=
tching that fish. I become so  peaceful fishing. And when I spot that big t=
rout rising across  the stream, the adrenaline rush is crazy. It's amazing =
to me  that I can get so excited about a fish.  I realized that  what had s=
tarted out as me trying to be as good as the guys  had become a practice in=
stead. It is not a battle after all,  but simply fishing: sharing tips, swa=
pping stories, being part  of a community.  I love being a beginner. It mea=
ns I  have years to practice and learn about this thing called fly  fishing=
. And I hope I never lose that beginners mind, because  it is the fuel that=
 pushes me further along and there is  always something new to learn.  BIO =
Kourtney  Morgan works as a sample maker for Patagonia where she began  fly=

n:   Pattern has a colder look to it this morning, while the Southern storm=
 track shows signs of action. Eastern ridge gone while arctic air tries to =
reload to the Northwest.   This may be the first time this winter a forecas=
t understates the cold rather than overstates it. Part of it stems from the=
 snowcover in the Plains, but most of it simply did not give the European e=
nough credit for its SE rotation of a Canadian air mass. I do believe its t=
ransient though with some moderation in order by midweek and the five day n=
umbers taken as a whole still are not that cold relative to normal. In many=
 ways, this will be similar to what happened in late December with the larg=
est departures from normal in the South. That will be due more from an acti=
ve storm track rather than any real intrusion of arctic air. Speaking of so=
uth! ern storms, we see rain breaking out across much of Western and Northe=
rn Texas today. This system will bring rain to much of the old South the ne=
xt couple of days. There is some potential for SE coastal development later=
 in the week which could be a Mid-Atlantic snow. But, I am more bullish on =
the next system in the series which could be a big storm over the weekend. =
While its turning colder in the East, often times we see a reversal in the =
West. That does not appear to be the situation in this case. Cold air is tr=
apped in much of the region and the upper level flow is not favorable to sc=
our this out. A gradual moderation may occur, but it still looks below norm=

are whether or not the storminess of the European models and the cold showi=
ng up in the Canadian verify. The most extreme solution obviously would be =
a combination of the two, but that seems unlikely given the results of this=
 winter so far. Of the two, I give the storm proposition the most weight. I=
t is possible the East coast could see a sizeable snow out of all of this. =
As for the cold, the Canadian since the middle of last week has been rebuil=
ding pressures in the NW territories. They become quite high this period, b=
ut are still North of the border. It once again becomes a wait and see game=
 to see if some of this real arctic air can come down. That, I am not ready=

ion:   A very healthy spring/winter storm to deal with in the short term. T=
his storm will bring about a pattern change, though still nothing severe in=
 terms of cold.  A mixed bag of precipitation has developed today over the =
Central Plains. A healthy combination of shallow cold air in the North and =
record warmth in the South will help spin up a sizeable storm in the Southe=
rn Plains later today that will turn to the NE. There are a variety of wint=
er weather watches out from Kansas, Missouri , Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois=
. More can be expected through the Great Lakes and New England later in the=
 week. There will be snow with this, but also some potential for significan=
t freezing rain as well. The storm track is expected to run from NW Texas t=
o just South of Chicago then Western New York. To the South, this is a rain=
 ! event with some thunderstorms as well. This storm will serve to collapse=
 the strong ridge that has been in place over the Eastern U.S. I certainly =
expect a drop from the record highs of recent days, but nothing in the eart=
h shattering cold category. In fact, the raw numbers from the MRF have tren=
ded warmer the last few runs. Since we dont have a thick snow cover to tap =
from, I believe the period of cold setting up will not be as harsh as what =
we saw in late December. As all of this is going on, some of the chill that=
 has invaded the West will be lifting out. I don't see a big run to above n=
ormal with a surface high still sitting over the plateau region, but it sho=
uld not be as cold as the last couple of days.    Tomorrow: Wednesday, Janu=

hile the talk in recent outlooks for the 6-10 day period has centered on co=
ld, it is interesting to note the new 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks from the N=
WS still have a warm bias to them. There is not a big snow cover on the gro=
und, a split flow in the jet stream is expected and the polar vortex in Can=
ada continues a slow retreat. With all of that as a backdrop, the slight po=
sitive departures look reasonable to me. We may however crank out a "Clippe=
r Type" storm next week in the Great Lakes and New England. These can somet=
imes be more prodigious snow makers than the big "Plains type" counterpart =
we are currently seeing. This is especially true if the air flows over the =
Lakes at the right angle, something I won't even try to predict this far ou=
t. Other than this system, I don't see much action in the 6-10 day period. =
Howeve! r, there is some potential for another storm to emerge out of the S=

***********************************************************************

LOOKING FOR THE VALUE IN ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES

Corporate leaders often found it difficult to determine if environmental
strategies are paying off. As a broader set of corporate stakeholders
influences the shape of environmental strategy, corporate leaders regularly
encounter conflicting evaluations of their performance and frequently lack the
evidence to justify changes in strategy.

*  Increasing shareholder value is the ultimate success factor but corporations
cannot easily demonstrate a direct link between how an environmental strategy
is implemented and shareholder value.

*  Corporations are searching for proxy indicators that often blend the
quantitative and the intuitive from both internal and external sources.

*  Recognizing that a broader set of evaluation tools are required reduces the
frustration of searching for the perfect performance measure and, in the long
term, improves assessment efforts.

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Stephane Brodeur should be removed from the list.
I am not sure about Chris Lambie, whether he is joining the company.
Garrett Trip should be added as the Ontario Power trader (that market won't open until May 2002)

:    The last of the warm air will be scoured out of the East today with ne=
ar to below normal temperatures for most of the country by early next week.=
 A very active Southern jet stream could spin up two more significant winte=
r storms through next weekend.  From the looks of the models today, the pat=
tern is about as active as it gets. Imagine the possibilities if only there=
 was more cold air in the mix. While brutal air is still not expected, the =
potential for winter farther South is on the increase next week. We will se=
e a temporary break from the storminess over the weekend. The current storm=
 now in Pennsylvania will move out to sea and drive colder air into the reg=
ion. A cool and dry weekend seems to be shaping up for most areas, but a we=
ak low will drop out of Canada, across the Lakes and toward New England on =
Sund! ay. The current storm will probably drive out most of the available m=
oisture, but some lake effect is possible so some light snow amounts should=
 occur. The next Pacific wave comes ashore in a fairly harmless fashion ini=
tially. However, the set up looks favorable for some sort of Low pressure t=

toward the SE US and could be an interesting factor. As far as temperatures=
 go, the high pressure over the Western Plateau (Colorado and Utah) is keep=

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm

No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.

Counselors are also available via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week for Enron employees in all locations.

Everyone,

We are in the process of creating new contracts with UBS for all Market Data real-time applications, subscriptions and publications.  Attached is a comprehensive list of all contracts that will be renegotiated under the UBS name for use by the Gas and Power trading entities.  

In order to leverage UBS' significant discounts and avoid duplicate efforts, Danielle Marcinkowski with Market Data will be the initial point of contact when inquiring about the addition or status of applications or publications.  I bring this to your attention because we understand that several groups have initiated discussions with the various vendors over the past few days.  

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at 713-853-9358 or Danielle at 713-853-7926.  If you think something is missing from the list, please bring it to our attention immediately.  Please pass this word around within your group as appropriate.

Regards,

Chris Behney

John,

I understand Peter Keohane is here today and through the weekend if necessary to complete contracts for Canada with UBS legal. I am hoping that completion of contracts includes identification of corporate entity (vain hope?)

Can you confirm whether or not you guys had planned to launch physical gas from day 1?

I have forwarded you e-mail to John Zufferli.  I don't know who in Canada had input into the Cdn. Operations timetable but I would have thought we would have wanted some physical day 1.  We have 5 of  8 traders here who are very, very, physical in what they have typically traded.  Hopefully John can give you some further insight.

Chris.

Chris,

Do you guys want to trade physical gas (and power?) from day 1?

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

Dave

It looks like 713-584 are the new prefix's, but they are as follows:

713-584-1091
713-584-1093
713-584-1050
713-584-1092

I've not been in that room, so I would guess that the first number would be sufficient.

on:   There is still no true arctic air in the pattern, but the Southern je=
t stream is active for storms and the trend is certainly colder than recent=
 weeks.   We have seen a definitive change in the weather pattern from last=
 month. January on the whole featured the strong ridge and unseasonable war=
mth in the Eastern U.S. while the West had a trough and occasional record b=
reaking cold. If you smooth out the maps, we will see in general a reversal=
 over the next two weeks with a trough in the East and Ridge in the West. I=
 still don't see any highlight making cold with this trough, but a "cold an=
d stormy" projection does not seem unreasonable for the East. We have this =
morning a storm in the South that will bring snow to Oklahoma and NW Texas =
today with rain farther South. It will track towards the SE U.S. coast thro=
ugh Th! ursday then appears to move out to sea. The Interior SE may see som=
e light to moderate snow with this, but otherwise will be a rainmaker. This=
 should be the most significant weather maker in the short term. The coldes=
t of the air in the short term covers the Eastern U.S. right now. This shou=

sed yesterday in the 6-10 day outlook still apply today. The Canadian and E=
uropean schemes still look sharper with the western ridge and eastern troug=
h than their American counterpart. The correct forecast up to now most of t=
he time was to go with the warmer solution. This time I am running with the=
 colder one. The Canadian model has been consistent with a stronger Eastern=
 trough since the middle of last week. It brings a moderate batch of arctic=
 air next week into the Eastern U.S. The potential of some sort of East coa=
st storm also remains in this pattern. I am not by any means forecasting an=
y brutal cold, but I am going against yesterdays NWS 6-10 and 8-4 day outlo=
oks which are above normal in the Eastern U.S. I believe most of the region=
 will grade out slightly below normal instead while th! e West is in a mode=

It was a tough decision, but Angela and I have picked a winner and two runners-up for coming up with the most creative idea for the "mystery item."  The winners and their answers are listed below:

Winner: 

David Hanslip for his answer of: 

"...To the casual observer, they look like the support pillars of any standard monitor stand. In reality, their special hollowed out interiors may be used to conceal sensitive accounting documents outlining off-balance sheet financing transactions from the FBI."

Second Runner Up: 
Paul Dunsmore for his answer of: 
"They are clearly snow shoes for the Smurfs that live in our office..." 
Third Runner Up: 
Carlee Gawiuk for her answer of: 
"The purpose of the object is for getting the attention of the commercial staff when they are not paying attention to their admin assistants.  There are 6 of them, 3 for each phone.  Simply pick up the object, close your fist around it, extend your arm behind your head, bring it forward in a fluid motion and release the object in the general direction of the person you are wanting to get the attention of.  If it takes more then one throw, that is completely acceptable.  It takes a little practice, so don't be too hard on your self if you need to borrow a few from the other phone.  It is not too big, so no serious damage will be done, & it's not too small so the person or anyone surrounding them will not lose an eye.  The colour is black to contrast with desk, or floor, so it is easy to find after it has been thrown."

Thank you to everyone else for your very creative answers! 
Congratulations to David, Paul, and Carlee (you may drop by front reception to pick up your prize)!!! 
Thank you, 
Megan Scott

 the next couple of days. Medium range models now suggest this may NOT be w=

Used Within the Volatility Matrix    Day 6-10 Discussion:  There are severa=
l considerations in the 6-10 day period. First, we could briefly turn on th=
e "Lake Effect" snow machine with a weak Clipper system early next week. Th=
is should not be anywhere near the magnitude of the Buffalo Christmas event=
, but is the first one since then. It drags a moderately cold airmass in be=
hind it. Then, later in the period the Southern jet stream becomes active o=
nce again. Most models show another sizeable winter storm mid to late next =
week and at a farther South latitude than the current one. Now, I dont see =
this 6-10 day period as particularly cold in a relative sense though certai=
nly it will be chillier than recent periods. Numbers may turn out a bit bel=
ow normal especially over the Northern half of the USA. Some of the models =
just past this period suggest a more significant Canadian high woul! d be p=
oised to drop down. The warming of the Canadian prairies does not look as l=
ikely as I have thought over the past few days, so this idea may have some =
merit. If the surface pressures forecast turn out to verify, the ocean indi=
ces(NAO and PNA) switch their signals and we get some snowcover the next 10=
 days from potential storms, then this may all come to pass. It would not b=
e an exaggeration to suggest the coldest air mass of the season could come =
down the second week of February.        Day 6: Monday, February  4, 2002  =

John,
This note is to officially announce that I will not sign the contract with UBS. I feel it is time for me to start something new and a great opportunity was presented to me in  Montreal. I want to thank you for everything you and this company did for me. I sincerely wish you all the success you deserve in this new adventure.

After having talked to Dawn, I will be in the office until Thursday Feb-21. It was understood that I will be paid for any unused vacation days.

Once again, thank you for your support and good luck with UBS!

Yours Truly,

I would have thought phys. would have been a priority up here.  I told Dave I wasn't involved in putting together the timetable and would forward the e-mail to you.

Chris,

Do you guys want to trade physical gas (and power?) from day 1?

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

Dave

Title: A Moving Supply and Demand Picture

***********************************************************************

US WEST HYDRO ON THE RISE, DEMAND LOW

Shifting 2002 electricity demand drivers and improvement of hydroelectric
conditions in the US West continue to change the outlook for 2002 and beyond.
Although 2002 demand will still contract from 2001 levels, CERA's updated
outlook calls for modestly stronger demand than previously forecasted. The weak
January fundamentals that have dragged down Henry Hub and western regional gas
prices should continue through February.

*  The level of voluntary and price-responsive electricity conservation in
California appears to be falling as the supply crisis abates.

*  Gas prices have been kept at bay by the lack of evidence of the expected
decline in US supply and weak national economic trends that point to further
delay in the rebound of industrial and power generation demand.

*  The abundant western snowpacks that will be shown to the world during the
winter Olympics are having an impact on regional energy markets.

Subject:	Curves and Correlations

I have to clean up clustering and curve mappings from Estate to NETCO.  Last correlation update was Nov. 29th and I'm assuming we may have some issues.  The curves we are rolling into NETCO need to be highly accurate for the last 60 days to ensure variance covariance matrix is appropriate.  Please provide me list of curves we are using in NETCO.  Identify which curves should be primary and which curves can be secondary.  Additionally, please identify if there are any regional constraints that need to be "locked in" between primary and secondary curves.  I will then re-run correlations so we can properly understand diversification benefit across wholesale as it relates to proposed VAR limit structures.

Thanks,
Frank

Here are the contracts we are currently creating with UBS.  Please verify that we have not missed any applications/publications or subscriptions.  

Highlight in Red the systems you will need and mark the priority from 1-5,  1 being critical.


Thank you,

With the recent shuffle of people moving to new desks, I'm sure there will be keyboard trays that need to be moved, as well as some repairs.  Wall 2 Wall will be in on Wednesday afternoon to look after this.  

Please let me know by Wednesday morning if you need anything done.

Tim and John, I wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between EOL and a trader having multiple trading books. EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.

1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. 

2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.

If the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.

John

Chris,
Here is a copy of our top counterparty list.  The online group will be sending out a packet that includes this list and all the information you're group will need to get started.  Please fill out the areas highlighted in red.  We simply need to assign someone from your office that will be our point of contact, as well as the person responsible for getting in the Password Application.  We are using each of the desks relationships to jump start the effort.  Once that is complete, the responsibility will role back over to the online group.  If at all possible, I'd like to have the appropriate names early this afternoon.  Sorry for the short notice.

Thanks again for your help,

Dan

Hello John:

I received your voice mail since NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS and ESBI don't fall under market data I will take them off of the list and you can setup the accounts directly with the vendors out of the Calgary office.  I will leave IHS Accumap under Market Data UBS since we currently have an agreement with them.  I will use Carmen as the contact for IHS Accumap. 

Thanks,

Danielle

The processes of Asset  management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the  long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term  perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link  short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to  show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in  order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset  owner.

Ancillary  Services Conference
 
April  10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado
 
OVERVIEW

 
As more and more regions in North  America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary  services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the  same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both  commerce and reliability. 
 
This conference will cover the key  engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these  functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various  markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions,  successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New  England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario,  will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead  scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and  congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating  costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply  these services.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

cussion:  More troughing in the East and ridging in the West. Pattern devel=
oping as advertised, but will the cold air materialize?  The Southern strea=
m storm track is alive and well and should continue to be so for the next c=
ouple of weeks. All of the models point to the potential of healthy winter =
storms in the midst of a warmer than normal temperature pattern. The lack o=
f realized cold continues to frustrate me as once again the air simply is n=
ot that frigid. We are still below normal relative to normal over much of t=
he South and West. In the West, it is due to high pressure trapped in the I=
ntermountain region while in the South it is in response to inclement weath=
er along the storm track. The North and East are back into a warming mode i=
n spite of the fact that a trough will reform in the East. Upstream over th=
e Western h! alf of Canada, it is just not that cold anymore. The MRF is up=
 to its old tricks of a sharp cooling "just past this period" and the Canad=
ian still insists on a moderate intensity high coming down this weekend. It=
 may well turn cooler, but certainly not in an excessive way. The five day =

Title: Energy Technology Investing: The Bubble Bursts
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2978;


***********************************************************************

DISTRIBUTED ENERGY INVESTMENT CHALLENGE--EXPECTATIONS MEET NEW REALITIES

Between 1998 and 2001, investors poured some US$4.36 billion into companies
developing distributed energy (DE) technologies. This investment boom and the
subsequent capital market correction were created by overly optimistic
expectations regarding the size of the opportunity and speed of the market's
development.

*  DE's failure to capture a substantial portion of the California market
during the power crisis in early 2001 and the collapse of the
telecommunications and information technology sectors undermined investors'
confidence. Shifting power market fundamentals and growing uncertainty over the
pace and direction of regulatory change also contributed.

*  Although the short-term market for DE technologies has suffered, in the long
run the revised expectations are part of a healthy trend toward greater
maturity among companies and their backers.

*  Restricted access to capital will slow commercialization of new technologies
and drive consolidation among energy technology companies. Public policy will
become an increasingly important source of funds and other support in the
future.

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

Louise

Greg/Louise - I would like your approval for a pool of $$$ to try to get all of the outstanding commercial staff in Canada signed. I would like approval for up to U.S. $250K/$250K to sign up the following "hold-outs":

1) Howard Sangwine
2) Grant Oh
3) Dean Drozdiak
4) Garrett Tripp
5) Steve Burnham
6) Lon Draper

Each of the above are highly marketable and have competing offers in hand. They have also been talking to their U.S. counterparts and know that there are funds available. Please advise.

John,
I'm hearing rumblings from Whalley and others that UBS may want to pick up Canadian service contracts from the Estate.  

Can you give me download of these deals?  (high level summary)

Guys, its getting late in the day and I feel we need to let people know where they stand. Please sit down with each of your direct reports and let them know that they will be receiving an offer of employment from UBS (hopefully by tommorrow).

With respect to Fabian and Gerry, I think its important to stress that although they didnt make the first cut, there is still a high probability of being offered UBS employment following the results of round one.

Subject:	**IMPORTANT** Stack Manager Users
Importance:	High


We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

John,

Can you confirm whether or not you guys had planned to launch physical gas from day 1?

I have forwarded you e-mail to John Zufferli.  I don't know who in Canada had input into the Cdn. Operations timetable but I would have thought we would have wanted some physical day 1.  We have 5 of  8 traders here who are very, very, physical in what they have typically traded.  Hopefully John can give you some further insight.

Chris.

Chris,

Do you guys want to trade physical gas (and power?) from day 1?

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

Dave

Looks good.  Feel free to write a couple of bullets regarding the types of instruments/commodities you believe are necessary, as this will help me flesh out ideas with UBS regarding trading universe.

Peggy & John
The estate's DPR reporting requirement to risk controls in Houston is going to be twice a week.  Consistent with this I would also like to change our internal DPR reporting process for ECC Power-Estate from DAILY to twice per week.  Note that curves and an official calc will still be required daily.
 
I would like to make this change starting Feb 1.  Please let me know if you are okay with this.
 
Kathy

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.
 
Chris

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance
