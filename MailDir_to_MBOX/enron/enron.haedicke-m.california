The DOE order requiring gas suppliers to supply gas to PG&E expires at 3:00 
a.m. EST on February 7.  In view of the DOE warnings that the order will not 
be extended, PG&E has received permission from the CPUC to grant to certain 
gas suppliers a security interest in certain of its receivables, and a draft 
security agreement and other documents were circulated over the weekend.  
Here is a summary of the proposal and associated risks:

Summary of Proposal:

The security interest will be granted only to those gas suppliers that 
execute the security agreement.  If we don't sign the agreement, we will 
remain unsecured (there are reasons to refuse to sign -- see below).  
PG&E is granting  a security interest in core customer receivables, and will 
also grant a security interest in its natural gas inventory designated for 
core customers if the value of its A/R falls below the amount owed to gas 
suppliers.  PG&E's figures indicate receivables in excess of payables for 
each of October, November, and December, with $491 million in receivables and 
$329 million in payables in December.
However, the security interest is subject to the prior lien of its First 
Mortgage Indenture, under which approximately $3 billion is outstanding (not 
currently in default).  PG&E believes the total collateral available to 
creditors under that Indenture is from $12 to $30 billion, and that creditors 
under that Indenture would be required to "marshal" assets in the event they 
foreclosed on their security (meaning that a court would require those 
creditors, who have ample access to security other than these receivables, 
would be required to go against that other collateral and leave the security 
for the gas suppliers alone).   
U.S. Trust Company will act as collateral agent (essentially, a trustee).
The security interest is in place until April 30 (per the CPUC order); PG&E 
could seek an extension of the CPUC order if necessary.
The collateral secures obligations for future deliveries only (the collateral 
will not secure PG&E's payment obligations for past supplies).
Suppliers executing the security agreement are committing to "negotiate in 
good faith" to sell natural gas to PG&E on "market" terms; a refusal to sell 
to PG&E on market terms presumably places a supplier in default of the 
security agreement, and the supplier would loses the benefit of the 
collateral.
For as long as the security agreement is in force, suppliers executing the 
security agreement are required to waive provisions in their existing supply 
agreements permitting them (i) to suspend performance on account of PG&E's 
failure to demand additional performance assurance, (ii) to demand payment or 
parent company guarantees, (iii) to declare a default under, terminate or 
suspend performance under, its supply agreement in the event of a bankruptcy, 
insolvency, appointment of liquidator, or failure to pay debts as the become 
due (no supplier is required to waive rights with respect to deliveries prior 
to the date of the security agreement).
PG&E will be required to deliver weekly reports on the value of its 
receivables at the end of the preceding week.

Risks:

Essentially, Enron's choice is (A) execute the security agreement, get the 
benefit of the security for future deliveries under existing commitments and 
any new deals we enter into, and subject ourselves to restrictions on our 
ability to refuse new deals or to exercise our rights under existing 
commitments, or (B) refuse to execute the agreement and remain unsecured, yet 
free of the restrictions and limits that the agreement will place upon us.

If we sign the agreement, we will be a secured creditor to the extent of 
PG&E's obligations covered by this agreement.  If not, we will be an 
unsecured creditor, potentially behind all of the suppliers that did sign the 
agreement.  This is assuming that this arrangement survives any bankruptcy of 
PG&E (it's reasonable to assume that it will).
Signing the security agreement does give Enron security for PG&E's payment 
for future deliveries of gas under existing contracts.  Should Enron decide 
to enter into new deals for additional volumes, PG&E's payment obligations 
would also be secured.  However, Enron will be required to negotiate in good 
faith to supply PG&E on market terms; PG&E has stated that this means that 
Enron will have to supply PG&E in a manner consistent with our dealings with 
PG&E over the past year.  This probably requires Enron to enter into new 
deals, and means that Enron will not have complete discretion in deciding 
whether to enter into new deals if Enron wants to keep the benefit of the 
collateral (if Enron refuses to enter into a new deal with PG&E, PG&E may 
have cause to terminate the security agreement as to Enron).  
The security agreement requires Enron to waive certain rights under its 
supplier agreements, including the right to declare a default upon a PG&E 
bankruptcy, as long as the security agreement is in place.  This could limit 
our flexibility to deal with our overall exposure to PG&E across contracts 
and affiliates in the event of a "meltdown".
There can be no guarantee that the courts would require the creditors under 
the First Mortgage Bond to marshal assets; this means that suppliers signing 
the security agreement may still end up subordinated to those creditors.
The security agreement is governed by California law, and suppliers are 
required to submit to the jurisdiction of California courts.  This means any 
dispute under these agreements will be decided by a California judge.

Subject:	Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential
Sensitivity:	Confidential

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any "out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff

FERC Approves Contentious Order on California
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last Friday unanimously
approved a comprehensive order on ways to fix California's troubled=20
marketplace.
Though some, including Commissioner Curt H,bert, hoped this order would
be the final word, FERC signaled that more work has to be done to reach
market consensus on several issues, including a new market structure for
the state.

ANALYSIS: Although some ongoing and larger issues remain, this order does
bring closure to FERC's proposed ruling from last month, which had outlined
several key remedies to repair what has roundly been called a flawed system
in California. FERC previously had determined that the dysfunctional market
structure in the state had caused "unjust and unreasonable rates" for=20
utilities
that must purchase power on the wholesale market, and end-use customers
such as those in San Diego who no longer are protected by a rate freeze.
With a couple of important exceptions, the Commission essentially gave
a rubber stamp of approval to its proposed order that was issued on Nov.
1, after receiving input from participants throughout the energy industry.

As expected, FERC adopted its "soft" rate cap of $150/MWh. In real terms,
this means that bids above this amount cannot set the market clearing price
that is paid to other bidders for power on the wholesale market. The rate
cap is referred to as "soft" because sellers may bid above this level and
receive their bid if they are dispatched, but anything higher than $150/MWh
will not set the price that all other generators will receive. Any generato=
r
setting a bid above $150/MWh must report their bid to the Commission, and
presumably fall under intense scrutiny.

FERC also officially adopted a policy that removes restrictions against
bilateral contracts in California and de-emphasizes spot-market activity.
Moving forward, buyers and sellers in the California market no longer
have to sell into and buy from the California PX. Instead, long-term contra=
cts
may be established between power distribution utilities and power sellers.
Specifically, FERC set into place a $74/MWh "target price" for forward
contracts. This represented a new policy on the part of the Commission
that had not previously been outlined in its proposed order, and was the
source of a great deal of contention within FERC. Commissioner Linda Breath=
itt
offered that the $74/MWh target price could possibly set the "standard
for reasonableness." However, unlike the $150/MWh rate cap for transactions
on the open market, prices below the target price of $74/MWh will likely
be accepted without the same level of scrutiny from FERC. Higher prices
may be subject to review.

A month ago, FERC had proposed establishing independent (non-stakeholder)
boards for the California Independent System Operator (ISO) and the PX.
This turned out to be more easily said than done, and was one of the earlie=
r
proposals from which FERC retreated in its final order. Essentially FERC
had wanted to replace existing members of the respective boards with new
members not associated with the energy industry. However, the word is out
that California Governor Gray Davis had put pressure on FERC to not adopt
this policy because the governor himself wants to be able to choose new
members for the boards that will be "more sensitive to the needs of Califor=
nia
consumers." In the end, FERC decided that a new governing structure for
both the ISO and PX would be put into place by April of next year, and
would be established with the cooperation of the governor and other state
officials. Until that time, the current board members will continue to
act in an advisory capacity.

Signaling that FERC's final order will by no means close the book on the
problems we are seeing in California, Southern California Edison (SCE)
immediately responded with "deep disappointment" to the Commission's order.
Specifically, SCE claims that the order will do nothing to protect Californ=
ia
consumers from the unjust and unreasonable wholesale electricity prices
that FERC already agreed were in existence in the state. SCE previously
had urged FERC to adopt cost-based pricing rules, meaning that each power
seller would be able to bid into the market at variable operating costs.
FERC had taken this cost-based approach with the initial operation of the
restructured PJM pool, which appears to be working rather well in that
area. However, FERC did not adopt this approach for California, and SCE
contends that since November the soft rate cap of $150/MWh has been in
place and rates have continued to skyrocket.

Reportedly, prices last week in California reached as high as $1,400/MWh,
compared to an average of $31/MWh, which SCE claims was the price that
it charged for power from its own plants during the month of December in
previous years. Thus, SCE contends that FERC has not fulfilled its regulato=
ry
obligation to repair the system in California, and as a result a severe
operational crisis in the state now appears inevitable.

Again, as we saw with the proposed order, dissension ran high within the
FERC itself. Commissioner H,bert reportedly felt that the final order was
"too timid" and that it did not do enough to solve the problems in Californ=
ia.
FERC Chairman James Hoecker appeared to be open to region-wide rate caps,
which H,bert strongly opposed and said could never receive approval from
the Commission. H,bert's consistent position has been that FERC is=20
over-extending
its reach to mitigate prices, something he believes the Commission is=20
ill-equipped
to do. H,bert, who by the way is rumored to become the next FERC chair,
dislikes any kind of rate cap and prefers instead to let market participant=
s
manage their own exposure to price risk.

As I had discussed when I outlined the proposed order back in November
(see IssueAlert from Nov. 2 on www.consultrci.com), I questioned whether
or not FERC could reach any long-term solutions to California's problems.
The lack of consensus regarding how to fix California's dysfunctional marke=
t=01*
not
only within the Commission, but throughout the industry as a whole=01*only
seems to be growing. FERC set out with the clear goal of bringing down
energy prices for consumers, but it is still questionable if this final
order can accomplish that objective. As SCE notes, the soft price cap has
done nothing to keep prices down in the state, and concerns about power
supply in California continue to increase. In fact, nearly every day during
this month the California ISO has issued a stage one or two emergency warni=
ng,
indicating that operating reserves of power in the state are falling to
alarming lows.

Consequently, although this order attempted to reach resolution, it still
seems like there is little chance that we will see the end of the debate
over California any time soon. Perhaps the best feature of this order is
the removal of the requirement that buyers must obtain their power through
the California PX. The three California investor-owned utilities (PG&E,
SCE and SDG&E) represent 80 percent of the buying market in the state.
Through establishing bilateral contracts, they will have a new way to=20
negotiate
the prices they pay for power, which could ultimately bring some stabilizat=
ion
to the market in the state.

However, if California is indeed headed for even worse problems than it
has faced thus far, it will quickly become apparent whether or not FERC's
order does anything to abate the crisis. Quite possibly, the next course
of action could be taking the California issues to federal court for=20
resolution,
which=01*much like our recent presidential election=01*could mean months (o=
r
years) of further negotiations.

USA: UPDATE 2-SoCal Edison in default, bankruptcy looms.
By Jonathan Stempel

01/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - In a move that escalates the California power 
crisis, embattled California utility Southern California Edison said on 
Tuesday it has suspended at least $596 million of payments to creditors, 
moving it closer to a possible bankruptcy filing. 
SoCal Edison and No. 1 rival Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a unit of San 
Francisco-based PG&E Corp., have run up billions of dollars of debt this year 
because they are subject to a rate freeze and have been unable to pass on 
their skyrocketing wholesale power costs to consumers.
In mirror filings on Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the 
state's No. 2 utility and its parent, Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison 
International, said that to conserve cash SoCal Edison has "temporarily 
suspended" three payments due Tuesday. 
These payments include $230 million of principal and interest on its 5.875 
percent notes, $215 million to the California Power Exchange, and $151 
million to "qualifying facilities," as well as "certain other obligations." 
Failure to make the note payment puts SoCal Edison in default on the notes, 
and on other of SoCal Edison's and Edison International's credit facilities, 
the filings said. The Power Exchange, which arranges sales of power to the 
utilities, can foreclose on collateral the utility pledged, they said. 
SoCal Edison said it had nearly $1.2 billion of cash on hand as of Monday, 
and will run out of cash on Feb. 2 assuming it makes all payments when due. 
"It's an extremely negative sign, and telegraphs the company's intention to 
take this to the mat," said Shawn Burke, head of U.S. investment-grade 
research at Barclays Capital. "Unless the legislature pulls a bill out of its 
hat, giving them virtually all of what they want, it's pretty much over." 
Edison International also said in the filings that it plans to amend the 
articles of incorporation and by-laws for Edison Mission Energy, a 
wholly-owned unit, to protect its low investment-grade ratings. 
Edison International shares traded Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at 
$9-1/8, down $1-1/16, or 10.4 percent. PG&E shares fell $1-9/16, or 13.5 
percent, on the Big Board to $10. 
On Jan. 4, the California Public Utilities Commission recommended giving the 
utilities a temporary 10 percent rate hike. The utilities, rating agencies 
and many analysts consider such a hike inadequate. Edison International has 
suspended its dividend, and SoCal Edison plans to slash up to 1,850 jobs. 
DOWNGRADES LIKELY 
The missed payments effectively ensure that credit rating agencies Standard & 
Poor's and Moody's Investors Service will cut at least some of SoCal Edison's 
credit and debt ratings to junk status. 
When a company misses a debt payment, S&P ordinarily does not wait for a 
grace period, if any, to run before cutting its rating for that debt to "D," 
or default. 
A downgrade to below investment-grade status would put SoCal Edison in 
default of some of its credit lines and bank loans, and ratchet up its 
liquidity crunch. 
"It's difficult to lend if there is no short-term solution, much less a 
long-term one," said Burke. 
The utility, as well as Pacific G&E, have been shut out of the short-term 
debt capital markets, and have already drawn on backup credit lines. 
S&P now rates most of SoCal Edison's senior long-and short-term debt 
"BBB-minus" and "A-3," its lowest investment grades. Moody's rates the 
respective debt a roughly equivalent "Baa3" and "Prime-3." The utilities' 
debt trades like junk. 
A third rating agency, Fitch, has already cut SoCal Edison's and Edison 
International's ratings deeply into junk. The bank loans and credit lines 
contain no default provisions triggered by that downgrade, analysts said. 
DELAYING REPORTING RESULTS 
Separately, SoCal Edison and Edison International said they plan to postpone 
release of their fourth quarter and year-end 2000 fiscal results pending 
further developments. 
Analysts said SoCal Edison is acting now to push California legislators and 
regulators to craft a remedy fast. 
"This is a rugged step toward moving this process along, and forcing 
California to do something," said Jerry Bellucci, senior vice president for 
Applied Economic Research, a New York-based energy consulting firm. 
Burke said SoCal Edison will wait as long as possible to file for bankruptcy 
protection.

USA: S&P to issue statement on SoCal Edison Tuesday.

01/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Jan. 16 (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said on 
Tuesday it plans to issue a statement by 12 P.M. (1700 GMT) about Southern 
California Edison's failure to make $596 million of payments to various 
creditors. 
The announcement came in a voice-mail message left by Richard Cortright, an 
S&P analyst following the California power crisis.
SoCal Edison, a unit of Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison International , said it 
temporarily postponed the payments as it seeks to negotiate a resolution for 
its cash crunch.


USA: Calif. declares highest level power alert.

01/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - California, in the grips of its worst-ever 
power crisis, on Tuesday declared a Stage Three power emergency, the 
highest-level alert, citing a severe shortage of power and natural gas needed 
to generate electricity. 
A spokesman for the California Independent Operator System (ISO), the agency 
that oversees the operation of most of the state's power grid, said it did 
not appear likely they would have to trigger rolling blackouts to relieve the 
heavy load on the system, although the possibility exists whenever a Stage 
Three alert is called.
The ISO spokesman said 10,700 megawatts of generation were off line in 
California for repairs or maintenance. Schools and offices reopened after the 
Martin Luther King Day U.S. holiday on Monday, pushing up demand. One 
megawatt powers about 1,000 homes. 
The spokesman said there was also a shortage of natural gas available in 
southern California, forcing power plants there to switch to oil to run their 
generators. About one-third of all California power is produced at gas-fired 
plants. 
California has declared a statewide Stage Three alert only twice before, but 
each time narrowly averted rolling blackouts as emergency supplies were made 
available from neighboring states.

Only 54% of Californians Feel That There Is an Energy Crisis

01/16/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

Knowledge Networks Unique Poll Finds Majority Expect Even More Increases 
>From the CPUC.
MENLO PARK, Calif., Jan. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- The energy crisis, which is 
dominating media coverage, paralyzing state government, and prompting 
industry to consider moving operations elsewhere, is causing less concern 
among average California citizens. Results from a recent survey conducted by 
Knowledge Networks using its unique population projectable Web-enabled panel, 
show that just 54% think the current situation is a crisis -- 21% don't 
believe that there is a crisis and 25% don't know. 
However, California citizens are losing confidence in the system that 
controls electric power in the state. -- 80% believe the CPUC will extend the 
recent temporary rate increase 
given to PG&E and Southern California Edison beyond the 90 day limit 
-- 75% expect an additional rate increase once the 90 day period is over 
-- 14% are positive about electricity deregulation 
-- 61% support reconsidering deregulation 

In addition to attitudes about changing deregulation, Californians were 
surveyed about an extensive range of proposals for dealing with the energy 
situation. People were asked the questions in the same manner as the various 
proposals have been summarized in the media reports. This may account for the 
high support received on a couple of the proposals. For example 90% of the 
respondents approved the Governor's suggestion to, "add new power generation 
plants within California and make existing plants more efficient." The 
proposal as worded doesn't distinguish between adding new plants or making 
existing plants more efficient or some combination thereof. Critics note that 
in the past Californians have been hesitant about power plants being built in 
their own communities. Among the other proposals, Californians are most 
supportive of: 
-- 76% Federal limits on the amount that electricity suppliers can charge 
for wholesale energy sold to California utilities 
-- 59% Incentives for reducing electricity usage by 8% 
-- 57% Creating a state power authority to take over existing plants and 
speed up the building of new power plants 

Attitudes towards the two largest investor owned utilities, PG&E and Southern 
California Edison are noticeably split. 41% find the explanations about the 
crisis given by the utilities to be believable, while an equal percentage 
(42%) don't believe them. With regards to the possibility of going bankrupt, 
46% think that it is somewhat likely that the two utilities will be forced to 
declare bankruptcy if they don't receive outside help. 70% think that the 
state and or Federal government should help prevent bankruptcy. 
While just over half think that the electricity situation is a crisis, there 
are clear signs that people take the situation seriously. When asked about 
actions they have taken to reduce their electricity usage a majority report 
taking basic steps like shutting off lights, reducing the temperature, and 
cutting back on holiday lighting. 
Looking forward, Californians will be replacing less efficient lighting and 
taking other steps to make their homes more efficient. 11% state that they 
will likely switch to another electricity supplier.

Southern Calif Edison Projects Will Be Out Of Cash Feb 2

01/16/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Southern California Edison, a subsidiary of Edison 
International (EIX), said it will be out of cash on Feb. 2 based on its 
current cash flow forecast, according to a Form 8-K filed Tuesday with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. , Southern California Edison had cash 
reserves of about $1.2 billion, according to the filing. 

08:49 AM
Southern California Edison said it estimates it has a $215 million payment 
due to the California Power Exchange Tuesday, $259 million in payments to 
qualifying facilities due through Jan. 31, a scheduled interest payment of 
$230 million on maturing 5.875% notes due Tuesday and $255 million pyaments 
for commercial paper due through Jan. 31. 
The company also has total expenses for energy delivered as of Monday, but 
not yet paid for, of $1.54 billion. 
However, Southern California Edison states that due to a "significant lag 
time" between the delivery of energy and the final billing, the actual 
expenses through Monday can't be determined at this time. 

Southern California Edison said that in an attempt to conserve cash it has 
"temporarily suspended" payment of $230 million of principal and interest on 
its 5.875% notes due Jan. 16, $215 million due to the California Power 
Exchange due Jan. 16, $151 million due to certain qualifying facilities as 
well as certain other unnamed obligations. 
As reported, a company representative told Dow Jones Newswires Monday that 
the company might not be able to make the payment to bondholders. 
According to the company, failure to pay the notes when due constitutes a 
default, allowing the noteholders to exercise remedies available to them. 
Failure to make the payment on the notes also constitutes a default under 
Southern California Edison's credit facilities, entitling the lenders to 
exercise certain remedies. 
If the company doesn't cure or waive the defaults within a specified time 
period, the defaults may trigger defaults on all outstanding series of the 
company's senior unsecured notes and subordinated debentures. 
Failure to make the payment to the California Power Exchange constitutes a 
default under the agreement, allowing the exchange to foreclose on collateral 
pledged by the company. 

According to the filing, Southern California Edison is attempting to avoid 
bankruptcy and intends to pay all of its obligations once a solution to the 
current liquidity crisis has been reached. 
However, the company warns that it's possible that it could be forced into 
bankruptcy. 
Based on the ongoing "uncertainties," Southern California Edison and Edison 
International intend to postpone releasing their financial results for the 
fourth quarter and year-end 2000 "pending further developments in federal and 
state regulatory proceedings, judicial proceedings, legislative enactments 
and other efforts to resolve the current energy crisis," notes the filing. 

Southern California Edison said in the filing that as of Dec. 31, the 
difference between the cost of supplying electricity to customers and the 
amounts received from customers reached $4.5 billion and "is continuing to 
increase." 
As reported, because of liquidity and other problems, the company has no 
unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities, and it's been 
unable to arrange any additional facilities. In addition, the company is 
unable to issue commercial paper or access the capital markets on "reasonable 
terms." 
On Jan. 4, the California Public Utilities Commission authorized a surcharge 
for 90 days in an attempt to help Southern California Edison as well as PG&E 
Corp. (PCG), which is also undergoing severe liquidity problems. 
Southern California Edison said the rate increase provides "no real relief" 
and will increase revenue by about $65 million a month during the three 
months the surcharge is in effect.

provides electricity to people in California. -Todd Goren; Fed Filings/Dow

Calif Gov Could Stymie Solution To Crisis -FERC's Hebert

(This article was originally published Monday) 
By Bryan Lee 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- High-level talks over the weekend on a plan to 
rescue California's troubled two largest utilities and keep power flowing to 
customers have brought participants no closer to a solution, sources involved 
in the discussions said Monday.
And as events Tuesday are expected to push the state's financially ailing 
electric utilities closer to bankruptcy, responsibility for the potential 
meltdown rests squarely with California Gov. Gray Davis, a key federal energy 
regulator said Monday. 
"You've got a governor who cares more about being on a nighttime news show 
than he does about fixing the problem in California," said Curtis Hebert, a 
Republican on the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Hebert criticized Davis, a Democrat, for his refusal to swallow the bitter 
financial medicine needed to rescue the state's flawed power market 
restructuring initiative. 
Hebert's comments echo those voiced privately by industry officials and 
Clinton Administration officials involved in unprecedented discussions 
brokered by the White House since Tuesday. 
The talks are designed to reach agreement on a plan that will allow the 
state's utilities to continue purchasing power for their retail customers, 
despite a liquidity crunch brought about by the state's power market 
restructuring effort. 
Broadly, the proposed deal involves having California's Department of Water 
Resources enter into long-term power sales contracts on behalf of the 
utilities. This would end the utilities' reliance on volatile spot markets 
for power purchases. 
In return, power generators are to grant some form of "forbearance" for the 
money they are owed while the forward contracts are ironed out. 
But throughout seven days of negotiations, Davis has refused to consider 
raising state-protected retail rates and has resisted calls for the state to 
issue credit guarantees for the utilities. In the meantime, Davis has 
insisted that power suppliers agree to sell the state power under long-term 
contracts at rates generators say is below their cost of production. 
Unless Davis backs down, no rescue package can be struck, some people close 
to the negotiations say. 
"Everybody's still trying to talk, (but) now it's spinning out of control," 
said a person involved in the discussions. 
A person representing power marketers and familiar with the status of the 
talks: "I don't see any great cause for optimism - particularly when I hear 
some of the things that Davis's office says." Governor's Office Rejects Talk 
Of No Progress 

A spokesman for the governor rejected the characterization that the talks 
were stymied. 
"People are working and moving forward," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's 
spokesman. "If they weren't closer (to an agreement), they wouldn't still be 
talking. To send a message to the markets that there's not progress here is 
irresponsible." 
Draft legislation to be unveiled Tuesday at the state Legislature will hold 
up the governor's end of the deal, Maviglio said. 
The legislation will give the state the authority to purchase power on behalf 
of the utilities, and the structure of the long-term contracts will give the 
utilities the ability to pay down the billions in uncollected power costs 
they have accumulated to date, he said. 
The utilities - Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison Co. 
and PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. - say they have no cash on 
hand and have been squeezed out of capital markets after hemorrhaging some 
$12 billion buying high-cost wholesale electricity and selling it for a 
considerable loss under state-mandated frozen retail rates. 
Southern California Edison has a multimillion-dollar bill due Tuesday for 
power purchases made in November and no cash on hand. Pacific Gas & Electric 
says it can squeak by until early February, but obtained approval from 
federal regulators on Friday for a corporate restructuring that will help 
shelter its successful unregulated business units should the utility unit 
files for bankruptcy. 
Developments could come fast and furious if financial markets open Tuesday 
with no deal struck. 
Wall Street credit ratings agencies have warned they will downgrade the 
utilities' debt to speculative, or junk-bond, status if a solution isn't 
reached soon. And various entities are expected to file emergency petitions 
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure that power keeps 
flowing to the state despite the utilities' inability to purchase power for 
their retail customers. 
According to sources familiar with the discussions, one filing would allow 
the Department of Water Resources to purchase wholesale power on behalf of 
the utilities, while another would give Southern California Edison more time 
to make good on amounts owed power suppliers. 
Whether the regulatory filings buy the utilities time to avoid bankruptcy 
remains to be seen. 
"They've got to make some real decisions here," FERC's Hebert said of the 
stymied negotiations with Davis. "If (Davis is) not willing to make those 
decisions, then certainly I think he's to blame."

Houston power supplier threatens to bankrupt California utilities

SACRAMENTO, California (AP) - In the midst of California's struggle to obtain 
more regional power, a major electricity supplier is threatening to take the 
state's two largest utility companies to bankruptcy court. 
If Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric do not make payments 
due this week, officials from Houston-based Dynegy Inc. said Monday they will 
have no choice but to take them to court.
"If we can't get this bill through in the next two days, this will start to 
unravel," Stephen W. Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, told the Los Angeles 
Times. "When and if they (Edison) default on Thursday, it puts us in a 
position where we have to take them into bankruptcy, and I'm sure others will 
be right beside us." 
Bergstrom refused to say how much money Dynegy is owed but said if any three 
creditors jointly petitioned the court, it would be enough to start 
involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. 
State and federal lawmakers are trying to craft a temporary solution to 
California's power crisis. Officials met this past weekend with electricity 
wholesalers to negotiate a plan by California Gov. Gray Davis for the state 
to buy electricity and sell it to utilities. That plan was to be introduced 
Tuesday in the Legislature. 
The state believes it can negotiate better prices than the utilities, which 
have seen their credit ratings plummet in recent months. PG&E and SoCal 
Edison say they have lost more than dlrs 9 billion because of wholesale price 
increases and the state's 1996 deregulation law that froze rate hikes. 
Electricity sellers have been increasingly reluctant to supply California 
because of the utilities' dwindling finances. 
Edison owes a major payment Tuesday to the Power Exchange, which manages the 
wholesale buying and selling of electricity. Power industry sources estimate 
the bill to be more than dlrs 150 million but believe the company has the 
resources to make the payment. Technically, SoCal Edison will not be in 
default on the payment until Thursday. 
Company officials refused to comment on their obligations to the Power 
Exchange. They said they would disclose details Tuesday in a filing with the 
federal Securities and Exchange Commission. 
PG&E officials said Monday that they would pay their dlrs 40 million bill due 
this week. The utility has approximately dlrs 500 million in cash, a 
spokesman said, with a bill for about dlrs 580 million due Feb. 1. 
On Monday, the state's power reserves shrank to nearly 5 percent even though 
many businesses were closed for the holiday. 
Dynegy purchased three Southern California power plants when SoCal Edison, 
PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric auctioned off assets as part of 
deregulation. The company's plants can generate enough electricity to supply 
2.8 million homes. 

California Utility's Power Supply Could Be Cut

Today could prove to be a critical day in California's electricity crisis as 
one of the state's biggest utilities, Southern California Edison Co., faces a 
possible cutoff from power supplies. 
Edison, a unit of Edison International Inc., is considering not paying a big 
wholesale electric-power bill, believed to be in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars, that comes due today from the California Power Exchange, a person 
familiar with the matter said. Edison is suffering from a cash shortage 
brought on by the skyrocketing cost of wholesale power. An Edison spokesman 
declined to comment yesterday.
A spokesman for the Power Exchange said Edison could face immediate cutoff 
from further purchases via the exchange if it doesn't pay its bill. However, 
the exchange was talking with various parties in an effort to avoid such a 
suspension. "We are still in negotiations. We don't know what we have yet," 
the spokesman said. 
The Power Exchange, created as part of California's utility-deregulation 
effort, serves as a crucial middleman between utilities and power generators. 
Under deregulation, Edison obtains much of its daily electricity through the 
exchange. An inability to buy through that venue could leave Edison and its 
4.2 million customers in Southern California facing power shortages and 
possible blackouts. 
Adding to the financial uncertainty surrounding Edison, Dow Jones Newswires, 
citing a senior Edison executive, reported late yesterday that the company 
has a $200 million bond payment due today that it also might be unable to 
pay. 
Meanwhile, state officials met through the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in 
Sacramento in a frantic effort to resolve the power crisis. Within the next 
24 to 48 hours, Wall Street and the energy producers "need a precondition, a 
signal that we're serious and heading in a direction they're comfortable 
with," said one lawmaker involved in the talks. 
One idea proposed by Gov. Gray Davis and others is to have the state use its 
financial resources to purchase power from electricity producers for resale 
to the financially beleaguered utilities. "We don't have to go into business 
tomorrow as the purchaser," the lawmaker said. "We simply have to make a 
strong enough and substantive enough statement coming out of the state 
capitol so that the creditors and [energy] producers will exercise 
forbearance." Such forbearance would give utilities more time to pay billions 
of dollars of wholesale power costs that they have accrued but haven't been 
able to collect from customers through rates. 
Several people involved in yesterday's talks said they were optimistic that 
some plan would be ready to present to a legislative committee today for 
public hearings and, potentially, a vote in the Assembly. They acknowledged 
that as of late yesterday that no agreements had been reached with 
electricity producers on such crucial issues as the price to be charged for 
the electricity and the length of the supply contracts. California's 
Legislature has been called into special session by Gov. Davis to consider a 
series of bills aimed both at improving the state's electricity supply and at 
curtailing demand. 
Edison's move on its Power Exchange bill could compress the timeframe for 
action. Many observers believed the utilities had sufficient cash to see them 
through early February, when another round of big wholesale electric bills 
comes due. 
Last weekend, the Pacific Gas & Electric utility unit of PG&E Corp. 
reiterated its belief that it has sufficient cash to pay its expenses until 
early February. In recent weeks, Edison and PG&E have said they are being 
pushed to the brink of insolvency and bankruptcy-law filings because of 
skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs. 
Some observers speculate that if Edison doesn't pay its Power Exchange bill, 
it could be a signal that the utility is moving closer to a bankruptcy-law 
filing. Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's director, said an analysis 
by the credit-ratings concern indicates that Edison has enough cash to pay 
the Power Exchange. Preserving cash by not paying bills "is often a tactic a 
company uses before bankruptcy," Mr. Cortright said. 
S&P and other ratings concerns have been closely following the California 
electricity crisis, because of the impact it could have on billions of 
dollars of utility bonds outstanding. The ratings concerns have severely 
downgraded both Edison and PG&E bonds. The agencies generally haven't dropped 
those bonds into "junk- bond" status, which is below investment grade. Such a 
downgrade would put the utilities into various financial defaults that could 
exacerbate their acute cash problems. 
While the California situation is "incredibly fluid," any failure by Edison 
to pay its power bills "paints a very, very dire picture," Mr. Cortright 
said. 
To better understand the current picture, state legislative leaders have 
recruited several legal and financial advisers. Among them is David Wiggs, 
managing director of Lido Capital in Newport Beach, Calif., a financial 
adviser to the utility and telecommunications industries. Mr. Wiggs, who has 
been hired to advise the newly created Assembly Committee on Energy Costs and 
Availability, is a retired chairman of the utility El Paso Electric Co. Mr. 
Wiggs, in turn, has hired to assist him Robert D. Albergotti and Stacey 
Cowand Jernigan, members of the Dallas law firm of Haynes & Boone. Two 
investment advisers from New York investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston 
Corp. are advising legislators on a pro bono basis. 
As regulators, politicians and executives struggled to come up with fixes, 
California itself struggled through another day of tight power supplies.

Power Firm Demands Utilities Pay Bills Now Electricity: Supplier says it will 
haul Edison and PG&E into bankruptcy court if money isn't forthcoming. 
Lawmakers scramble for a solution.

SACRAMENTO -- Increasing the pressure on state lawmakers to craft at least a 
temporary solution to California's power crisis, a major power supplier 
threatened Monday to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & 
Electric into bankruptcy court unless the utilities pay their bills due this 
week. 
The move by Dynegy Inc. of Houston upped the ante on a day when legislators 
huddled with financial experts and lawyers but reached no agreement on a 
mechanism for the state to buy electricity for Edison and PG&E at rates far 
lower than they pay now--allowing the beleaguered utilities breathing room to 
restructure their massive debts.
"If we can't get this bill through in the next two days, this will start to 
unravel," said Stephen W. Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. "When and if they 
[Edison] default on Thursday, it puts us in a position where we have to take 
them into bankruptcy, and I'm sure others will be right beside us." 
Bergstrom refused to say how much money Dynegy is owed, but said if any three 
creditors jointly petitioned the court, it would be enough to start 
involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. 
Under a plan outlined this weekend by Gov. Gray Davis after marathon 
bicoastal negotiations, the state would use its excellent credit rating to 
purchase electricity and then resell it to debt-hobbled utilities. 
The state Department of Water Resources has stepped in on an emergency basis 
to buy power to prevent blackouts, but Davis' plan would, overnight, make 
California the biggest single buyer of electricity in its own market. 
Legislators generally backed the need for the state to buy power, but there 
has been no agreement on two key issues: the price and the duration of the 
contracts. The price needs to be low enough so that utilities, with the rates 
currently in place, can save enough to restructure their debts--but high 
enough so that the power producers will go along with the plan. 
With attention focused on how Wall Street will view the tenuous agreement 
when markets reopen after the weekend, legislators were fighting multiple 
deadlines in trying to make good on the weekend promise to pass a bill by 
today. 
Edison owes a major payment today to the Power Exchange, the market created 
in 1998 under deregulation. 
Power industry sources say they believe Edison has the cash to make the 
payment, estimated at more than $150 million, but that the firm could play 
high-stakes political poker by delaying payment to increase pressure on 
lawmakers. Technically, Edison will not be in default on the payment until 
Thursday. 
Edison officials refused to comment on the negotiations with state leaders or 
the firm's obligations to the Power Exchange. They said they would disclose 
details today in a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
PG&E officials said Monday that they would pay their $40-million bill due 
this week. The utility has approximately $500 million in cash, a spokesman 
said, with a bill for about $580 million due Feb. 1. 
Electricity sellers have been increasingly reluctant to supply California 
because of the deteriorating financial condition of the utilities. 
The volume of electricity traded in the Power Exchange has dropped by roughly 
75% in the last month. Grid operators have struggled daily to buy enough 
power to balance flow on high-voltage wires and prevent blackouts. 
On Monday, a holiday during which many offices and businesses were closed, 
the state's power reserves shrank to nearly 5%. 
Legislators, convened in an emergency session on the state's energy crisis, 
quickly seized on Davis' idea. 
"We're working here around the clock, doing everything we can," said Assembly 
Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) during an afternoon break in talks 
among a half-dozen Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Also involved were 
the state's finance director, a bankruptcy lawyer, and two utility experts 
from Credit Suisse First Boston. 
Their purpose was to craft a skeleton of the legislation that California will 
need to implement Davis' proposal and have it passed by at least one house of 
the Legislature today. 
Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) has said that while the 
Legislature works, power generators should be willing to give utilities 
leeway on bills coming due. 
But that's unlikely unless the Legislature acts quickly, said Bergstrom of 
Dynegy. His company purchased three Southern California power plants when 
Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric auctioned off assets as part of 
deregulation. Dynegy's plants can generate enough electricity to supply 2.8 
million homes. 
"We're just not going to do that," Bergstrom said, "because the stakes are 
too high." 
He met with Davis and California lawmakers in Washington, D.C., last Tuesday 
evening and spoke to them again through a bicoastal video conference 
Saturday. The governor has been lobbying power plant owners to sign long-term 
contracts with the utilities at roughly 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour--well 
below the recent market rate of 30 cents. 
Power plant owners call that price unrealistic unless the contract lasts at 
least six or seven years, allowing them to recoup money later, when the cost 
of natural gas is expected to fall and make electricity cheaper to generate. 
Contract details do not matter, Bergstrom said, so long as the utilities are 
so debt-ridden as to be unworthy of credit. That's why the state needs to 
step in to buy power and guarantee payment, he said. 
But some lawmakers have downplayed the urgency. 
Burton has said it is more important to get the details of a bill right than 
to move quickly. 
To insert the state as a go-between in California's electricity market raises 
many complex financial and political issues. 
Even lawmakers who support helping the utilities insist that consumers get 
something in return. 
Stock options, ownership of utility transmission lines or takeover of 
hydroelectric power plants--a cheap source of power that affects the 
environmental health of many Sierra Nevada rivers--are among the assets the 
state should consider, Burton said. 
Hertzberg spokesman Paul Hefner said lawmakers have included bankruptcy 
lawyers and financial experts not solely to impress Wall Street, but also 
because they realize they are entering a realm they know little about. 
He said politicians clearly want to "send a message to financial markets" 
that they are working with industry experts when considering the consequences 
of their legislation. 
But he said their main goal is to get technical advice from someone who is 
not a bureaucrat and is not employed by a power firm.

Court May Decide if Power Users Pay More Court: Edison calls ruling that it 
can pass on costs a victory. The PUC says it's just the first of many steps 
in the battle over setting rates.

A federal judge's recent ruling that Southern California Edison Co. has the 
right to pass on to consumers its costs of acquiring power on the wholesale 
market does not mean that ratepayers will have to bear any of those costs 
soon. 
But the decision nonetheless provided immediate benefits to the beleaguered 
utility--primarily making the company look more financially secure and 
credit-worthy because the ruling could pave the way for a recovery of more 
than $2 billion for Edison.
Consequently, attorneys and spokesmen for Edison trumpeted the ruling of U.S. 
District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew as a significant victory. Attorneys for the 
California Public Utilities Commission played down the decision's 
consequences, saying it was merely the first skirmish in a long process. 
Regardless of how significant Lew's ruling was, the legal battle clearly has 
important ramifications, and they go beyond Edison's financial health. 
Ultimately, the case, titled Southern California Edison vs. Loretta M. Lynch 
(president of the PUC), may determine whether Edison's customers have to pay 
more for electricity. 
Moreover, the case--and a virtually identical one filed by Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. in Oakland federal court--may clarify whether there will be any 
change in the traditional demarcation of regulatory authority over utilities 
as a result of deregulation. 
Historically, the federal government has regulated wholesale power rates and 
state governments have regulated retail rates, those charged to consumers. 
One of the key issues in the Edison and PG&E cases is the utilities' 
contention that a PUC-imposed rate freeze violated the traditional 
demarcation by indirectly interfering with federal regulatory authority. 
Both companies say that they have been prevented from recovering their 
wholesale purchase costs because of the rate freeze imposed by the PUC as 
part of the massive utility deregulation law enacted in 1996, known as AB 
1890. 
Unless the issues are resolved by legislative action on the state energy 
crisis, it seems likely that the two suits will wind up in the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals and perhaps ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court. The 
California Public Utilities Commission and the Utility Reform Network, a 
consumer advocacy group, are opposing the companies in court. 
The 1996 deregulation law provides that the California rate freeze lasts 
until March 31, 2002, or until what are known as a utility's "stranded costs" 
(in essence, certain assets such as nuclear power plants that were overvalued 
in 1996) are recovered. The PUC determined last year that San Diego Gas & 
Electric, the state's other major privately owned utility, had recovered its 
"stranded costs," enabling that company to impose rate hikes. But the agency 
has said that Edison and PG&E are not entitled to take such action yet. 
On Jan. 8, Judge Lew agreed in principle with Edison's contention that the 
Federal Power Act trumps California's 1996 energy deregulation law. 
Lew rejected the PUC's argument that he should dismiss the case because 
retail rates are exclusively a matter of state regulation. The judge also 
rejected the agency's alternative request that he defer a decision for at 
least 120 days while the PUC gathered more facts. The judge said the gravity 
of the situation required immediate action. 
PUC actions "are having devastating effects on [Edison's] current ability to 
obtain financing to enable it to continue to procure wholesale power at 
current prices," Lew said. 
In essence, Lew agreed with Edison's lawyers, Ronald L. Olson and John W. 
Spiegel, that the company is caught in "a vise that threatens to squeeze it 
out of existence." 
"On the one side, SCE has been forced to pay astronomically high prices to 
buy wholesale electricity," the lawyers said in a brief filed in Lew's court. 
The 1996 statute requires SCE "to procure all of the electricity needed to 
serve its 4.3 million retail customers from two wholesale market 
institutions, whose pricing practices are exclusively within the Federal 
Regulatory Commission's jurisdiction. Since last June, the cost of procuring 
electricity through these market institutions has increased nearly 
four-fold," the attorneys said. 
"On the other side, SCE has been unable to recover these expenses through 
retail rates, which are currently frozen under California law." In addition, 
Edison's lawyers maintain that the PUC has interpreted California law "to 
prohibit SCE from recovering these costs, either now or in the future." 
Consequently, Edison has had to buy high and sell low, leaving it with a 
shortfall in excess of $2.6 billion, the company says. 
The PUC counters that a substantial portion of Edison's costs are paid to 
itself from power the company buys from its own plants and that Edison has 
reaped additional billions in the last two years from the sale of certain 
assets. The agency contends that those funds should be available to offset 
the financial problems the company is complaining about. 
The PUC also contends that Edison failed to take other steps that could have 
lowered its costs in acquiring power. 
In addition to the dispute over the facts, there has been a clash over Edison
's contention that California's rate freeze interferes with federal 
regulation of the wholesale energy market. The PUC and the Utility Reform 
Network counter that the freeze is an essential component of the Federal 
Regulatory Commission's approval of wholesale sales. 
The regulatory commission has taken no formal position on the pending 
litigation. However, Douglas W. Smith, the agency's general counsel, sent a 
letter to Edison attorney Spiegel saying that the "filed rate doctrine" 
applies in a situation such as this. The doctrine, according to a 1986 U.S. 
Supreme Court decision, holds that interstate power rates filed with the 
Federal Regulatory Commission or set by it must be given binding effect by 
state utility commissions determining intrastate rates. 
However, Michael Strumwasser, attorney for the consumers group, said the 1986 
Supreme Court decision arose in an entirely different context. He said the 
specific question now at issue--whether the "filed rate doctrine" applies 
when wholesale rates have been set by market forces rather than a regulatory 
proceeding--has never been ruled on by an appellate court. 
Lew made no explicit rulings on the PUC allegations that Edison should have 
offset wholesale payment costs through other revenues. 
However, Lew said the PUC is entitled to present evidence about the prudence 
of Edison's wholesale electricity purchases. Further hearings on that issue 
could determine how much of its costs Edison is entitled to recover. The PUC 
contends that Edison could have made some purchases at lower prices than it 
did. But Edison attorneys counter that this is a disingenuous argument, 
because the PUC has not objected to the prudence of Edison's purchases. 
Indeed, the Edison lawyers say the next phase of the case should be very 
brief because the PUC, in effect, consented to Edison's prior actions. 
Attorneys for the PUC and the consumers group disagree sharply, saying a bevy 
of issues need to be reviewed in detail. There is no timetable for further 
proceedings in the Edison case. The next hearing on the PG&E case is 
scheduled for Jan. 30 in Oakland.

Stealthy Deal Protects Profits of PG&E's Parents

FINAL
A1
(Copyright 2001)

PG&E Corp. has quietly won approval from federal regulators to restructure 
itself in a way that shields the parent company's profits, and shareholders, 
from the mounting debts of the utility it owns. 
The move appears to allow Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s parent to record 
substantial profits while maintaining that its subsidiary, which supplies 
power to 4.5 million customers, is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and 
trying to force ratepayers to pick up the tab.
The corporate restructuring, approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission on Friday, came as a surprise to consumer advocates and state 
leaders dealing with the energy crisis -- including Gov. Gray Davis. They 
have been working feverishly the past seven days to construct a deal that 
would alleviate debt pressure on PG&E and Southern California Edison by 
having the state of California buy power and provide it to the utilities at 
cost. 
Steve Moviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said the governor was displeased by 
PG&E's move, although he said it was not likely to derail the state's efforts 
to intervene in the crisis. He also said Davis was "disappointed that FERC 
acted in the middle of the night without notice to all parties." 
Ratepayer advocates and even some state officials have said that any aid to 
the ailing utilities should be offset by the huge profits that PG&E Corp. has 
made during the crisis from electricity generation and trading revenues. The 
money has certainly flowed in the other direction, they argue. In the past, 
PG&E Corp. has used revenues from the utility to pay down corporate debt, pay 
stock dividends and buy assets in other states. 
PG&E Corp.'s action appears to eliminate that possible means of paying off at 
least part of the $2 billion in debt incurred since November by its utility, 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., as it bought power at prices higher than it can 
legally charge customers. 
"It's certainly a response to them feeling the threat that the holding 
company's going to be held responsible for all this," said Bob Finkelstein, 
an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, an advocacy group. 
Meanwhile, California's energy crisis continued in full force yesterday, as 
the California Independent System Operator issued a Stage Two emergency, 
meaning that demand had reached within 5 percent of the state's electric 
supply, prompting requests to certain large users to shut down and conserve 
power. This occurred despite a national holiday, Martin Luther King Day, on 
which most businesses were closed and demand was forecast to reach about 
30,000 megawatts, a fairly modest number. 
Further, conditions appeared as if they were going to worsen imminently. 
Edison said it will be unable to pay bills coming due today, and PG&E said it 
has only about $500 million on hand to cover what it owes. Bankruptcy filings 
by both utilities appeared more likely. 
State leaders were still in negotiations yesterday to broker a deal in which 
California's Department of Water Resources would step in and buy power on 
behalf of the utilities, who are facing a growing inability to pay for their 
purchases. The talks were reported to be breaking down, however, because 
Davis refused to consider raising California rates or backing utility debts 
with a letter of credit from the state. 
In San Francisco, state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton said legislation 
passed last week by the Assembly will probably make its way to the governor's 
desk by the end of the month. One bill would change the makeup of the boards 
that oversee the state's power market, and the other would prohibit utilities 
from selling off their power-generating assets. 
In the midst of yet another Stage 2 electrical emergency the Democratic 
leader said, "I want the people of California to have long, stable, available 
energy throughout the rest of our lives." 
But in the short term, with the threat of rolling blackouts and urgent 
requests for power conservation, Burton stated the obvious: "Turn the goddamn 
lights off," he said. 
NO CHALLENGES TO RESTRUCTURING 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved PG&E's restructuring plan 
on a 3-to-1 vote on Friday. It was apparently described in a Dec. 28 public 
notice as a stock transfer, and thus flew under the radar screens of most 
observers. Details of the plan were first reported in the Wall Street Journal 
on Monday. 
Greg Pruett, a spokesman for PG&E Corp., said the intent of the plan was 
merely to allow another unit of the corporate parent, National Energy Group, 
to receive its own credit rating that would be weighed independently of the 
troubled utility. But he acknowledged that all or nearly all of PG&E Corp.'s 
assets outside the utility are held by National Energy Group and that the 
move would reduce the liability for the corporation. 
Although it was unclear whether PG&E informed state leaders of its plans, 
Pruett said the notice of the meeting was publicly available and had at least 
been provided to the Public Utilities Commission. 
In addition to proceeds from the sale of power plants and other revenues that 
PG&E has forwarded on to its corporate parent, the utility has reaped 
windfall profits during the crisis from the generation and sale of 
electricity and has not applied those profits to its own debt. To do so would 
require an accounting rule change by the California Public Utilities 
Commission, but company officials have maintained that should not be done. 
PG&E IN DEBT TO ITSELF 
Critics say that PG&E is its own biggest debtor, with money flying out of one 
pocket and into the other and that nearly half of its debt is owed to itself. 
In the third quarter of 2000, the company reported a 22 percent increase in 
profits, with a net income of $225 million, while saying it expected 
California consumers to eventually pick up the tab for its debt. 
--------------------------------- ON TAP TODAY -- Shortage: Electricity 
demand is expected to grow as Californians return to work from a three-day 
weekend, increasing the likelihood of energy emergencies. -- Talks: Energy 
officials huddle in Washington and Sacramento over Gov. Gray Davis' plan for 
the state to buy energy for the beleaguered utilities. -- Credit: If Wall 
Street doesn't like the plan to rescue the state's ailing utilities, it may 
begin downgrading stock and bond ratings - even to "junk" status. -- 
Payments: Southern California Edison has a multimillion dollar bill coming 
due, but the company says it has no money to pay.

Market notice:

On January 24, 2001, the CEO of the California ISO received by fax a letter
from John R. Fielder, Senior Vice President of Regulatory and Policy Affairs
at Southern California Edison (SCE).  Mr. Fielder stated that SCE was
providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO Tariff "that
SCE will not be performing all of its obligations under the ISO Tariff
because it will not be paying every invoice due to Uncontrollable Forces, as
defined in the ISO Tariff."  Mr. Fielder stated that the Uncontrollable
Forces were "regulations and restrictions imposed by governmental
authorities, including without limitation, the CPUC's order of January 4,
2001, that failed to authroize SCE to obtain, and restricted SCE from
obtaining sufficient funds to enable SCE to meet its payment obligations."
Mr. Fielder further stated that, "[b]ecause SCE's action is due to
Uncontrollable Forces, the ISO should not attempt to exercise any remedies
against SCE for non-performance and SCE will hold the ISO responsible for
the consequences of the ISO exercising any such remedies."  Finally, Mr.
Fielder stated that SCE was using its best efforts to mitigate the effects
of the regulations and restrictions and would continue to do so.  The CEO of
the California ISO has written to Mr. Fielder stating that it is studying
the position taken in Mr. Fielder's letter and that for the moment it
neither accepts nor rejects the position.  The purpose of this market notice
is to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly against
SCE based on SCE's failure to pay ISO invoices.

The latest from the ABI:

California PUC Likely to Abandon Electricity Deregulation
California's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) will vote today on a measure that could strip away one of the last vestiges of the state's failed experiment with energy deregulation, which was widely blamed for rolling blackouts and ballooning bills, according to the Associated Press.  Deregulation would be replaced with a system dominated by the governor, a new public power authority and three troubled utility companies. The vote comes as other states are backing away from the experiment that was supposed to revolutionize the energy industry.  Today's vote could wipe out consumers' ability to choose their electricity provider and buy power directly from retailers. T
 rumpeted at its creation in 1996 as a way to stimulate competition and lower electric rates, deregulation foundered after a year of soaring wholesale electrical prices and customer bills, the bankruptcy of the state's number one utility (Pacific Gas & Electric), and energy shortages that led to rolling blackouts.

California Renewable Power Plant Owners Fight Edison Bankruptcy
A bankruptcy proceeding for Edison International's regulated utility subsidiary, Southern California Edison (SoCal Edison), would have severe negative consequences for the renewable energy community and for all Californians, the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee announced yesterday, Dow Jones reported.  The association said it was responding to media reports that other creditors are on the verge of forcing Edison into bankruptcy.  "Such a filing would raise the cost of doing business in California for years to come," the group said.  "Those who finance bonds to carry out capital improvements will place risk premiums on California projects, if it is demonstrated through the bankruptcy of both of the state's largest utilities that default on debt is an acceptable option."

In March, several members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee came close to initiating an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against Edison, but a key court decision and the movement of some funds to the generators staved off the move.  "The committee will not take action for now to force Edison into bankruptcy as long as a legislative solution to take care of back payments and encourage the use of renewable energy remains possible," the committee said.

Long Beach, Power Suppliers May Force SoCal Edison Bankruptcy
The City of Long Beach, Calif., is mulling over a plan to join two large power generators in a move to force California's second largest utility into an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, Dow Jones reported.  Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy Inc. have been in contact with the city about joining the two companies to force Southern California Edison (SoCal Edison) into involuntary bankruptcy.  It takes three creditors, who are owed a combined $10,000, to force such a proceeding. Long Beach has a lawsuit against the Edison International unit, claiming it's owed $19 million for power it supplied to the utility in which it was never paid. The council is expected to decide on its next course of action at its meeting next Tuesday.
Mirant and Reliant's top executives said they are trying to recruit one more creditor in hopes of pushing the utility into bankruptcy this week. The companies already have the bankruptcy filing prepared and are looking for one more signature, executives said.  The generators are owed more than $500 million, of the $1 billion SoCal Edison owes to power generators. The companies have also been trying to recruit small power producers, the state's so-called qualifying facilities, to join in an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding.  Ted Craver, chief financial officer for Edison International, said the company would vigorously fight an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding.

		 Subject: Commission Actions to Remove Obstacles in Western US- Key Points 
for EPSA Comments, Due MARCH 30TH


MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy
            Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: March 20, 2001

RE: Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease
      Consumption in the Western United States--Key Points for
      EPSA Comments Due MARCH 30TH

As we previously reported, on March 14, 2001, FERC announced certain actions 
to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in 
an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas 
Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further 
Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption.  The 
following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to "immediately 
help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory 
incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure."  The 
Commission also invited comments on certain proposals.  This memo includes a 
list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March 30th.

Overview of Order

The Order reflects a thorough review of  "all of [FERC's] rate and facility 
certification authorities in the areas of electric energy, natural gas, 
hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy 
supply"; however, the Commission noted that its authority is "somewhat 
limited."  While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the 
lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission, 
as well as demand reduction measures, the Commission noted that the impact of 
California's energy shortage on the Western Interconnection "underscores the 
regional, interstate nature of the energy marketplace."  Accordingly, it 
encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for 
western markets.

EPSA appreciates the Commission's effort to exercise the full extent of its 
authority to help ease the West's energy problems.  Taken together, the 
Commission's proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational 
solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West.  Most importantly, the 
Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment, 
including increased generation, transmission and natural gas pipeline 
facilities.

The Commission's immediate actions, which will expire on December 31, 2001, 
include:

-Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to 
provide FERC with a list of short-term grid enhancements.

-Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and 
fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities (QF).

-Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup 
and self-generation for businesses with prior notice waivers and market-based 
rate authorization.

-Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale 
market-based rates.

The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals, including:

-Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs.

-Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly 
increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term.

-10-year depreciation for short-term transmission projects, and 15-year 
depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service 
by November 1, 2002.

-Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA  o210(d) to help 
alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load.

EPSA's Comments

In its conclusion, the Commission stated that comments should be "concise and 
focused."  Accordingly, we suggest that EPSA's comments focus on the 
following areas:

? Applaud the Commission's effort to increase supplies from QFs, but 
encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to 
sell to creditworthy parties.

? We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the 
relative merits of an incremental versus a "rolled in" approach to 
interconnection and upgrade costs.  Therefore, while we may lack a consensus 
on the question as a final policy position, we believe that the extreme 
circumstances surrounding the Order, and the urgent need to move power 
quickly into the Western system, make it wise to endorse FERC's instant 
recommendation.

? The Commission's proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating 
to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher 
ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps.  The 
Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in 
regional transmission organizations.  However, given the current situation 
and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher 
ROE, EPSA could support this proposal.

? Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on 
the energy supply system.  Therefore, the Commission's proposed waivers of 
blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects, 
are favorable developments.

We will discuss the Order and EPSA's comments during tomorrow's Regulatory 
Affairs/Power Marketers' conference call.  In addition, we have been asked to 
consider what type of short-term relief could be included in federal 
legislation.  We will discuss this question as well.  To access the call, 
dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call. In the meantime, 
if you have any questions, please contact either Julie Simon, jsimon@epsa.org 
or Mark Bennett, mbennett@epsa.org at (202 628-8200).

Richard --

Here is the FERC Order on California issues.

Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order 
effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters 
and we will not give them the information they are requesting in their 
Subpoena?  Maybe we should ask Mike Day and Dan Watkiss for their opinion on 
this matter before we do anything else in terms of responding?

Attached please find the write-up on California.  

The paper includes four sections - (1) Background & Status, (2) Upcoming Issues & Recommendations, (3) Legislative and Regulatory History of California Restructuring, and (4) Summary of PG&E - Enron Correspondence on Payment of Negative CTC.

We have also pulled together most of the primary documents (CPUC Orders, Legislation, etc.) that are discussed in this paper.  This material is quite lengthy and if anyone wants a copy, please let me know (I intend to send one to Tim Belden/Steve Swain).

If we need to hold a meeting to discuss any of this, I'll be happy to set something up for tomorrow.

Thanks,

Jim

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

Vicki Sharp, John Klauberg and I had a short call on Sunday to discuss any 
legal issues associated with the proposed accounting treatment of certain of 
transactions between EPMI and EES.

1. EPMI has requested that the economics of the Assigned Transactions (the 
PGET transactions assumed by EPMI and referred to in the December 28, 2000 
letter between EPMI and EEMC) be held by EPMI, and not retained by EEMC as 
provided by the letter agreement.

Wes, could you confirm that EPMI wishes to assume the economics of those 
transactions effective 1/1/2001?  I have assumed that this is the case, and 
have drafted an amendment to the December 28 letter accordingly (attached 
below).  Please review and let me know if this is something we can work with 
(note that the draft letter may need revisions based upon resolutions of 
other issues raised in this e-mail).  We will also need to confirm that there 
are no undesirable tax or bankruptcy implications to this approach.

One element of the assignment of the "Regulatory Receivable" and the 
assignment to EPMI of the PGET trades that we have questions regarding is the 
apparent lack of consideration flowing back to EEMC/EES as a result of these 
transactions -- we will have transferred some fairly substantial assets from 
EEMC/EES to EPMI, but have made no provision for those entities receiving 
anything in exchange.  The December 28 letter did make reference to the 
possibility of "back-to-back" transactions between EPMI and EEMC, which may 
answer that questions with respect to the assignment of the PGET trades, but 
if we are going to go that route, we would need to work out the terms of 
those "back-to-back" transaction by which EPMI sells the power that it 
purchases from PGET/Avista to EEMC to enable EEMC to fill its short position. 
For instance, at what price would EPMI resell the PGET/Avista power to EEMC 
so that EEMC can supply the requirements of its Direct Access Customers?  If 
the transfer price is at market, EEMC will recognize a significant loss on 
sales to its DACs.

2. On January 17, 2001, EES and EEMC assigned certain of their "Regulatory 
Receivables" to EPMI.  The assignment was intended to be an absolute transfer 
and true sale of EEMC/EES' rights in those receivables, but the Assignment 
Agreement does not recite any consideration for that transfer.  Again, we 
assume that the transfers of those receivables would leave a  "hole" in EES' 
books that, in an arms-length transaction, would be filled by the 
consideration that EES/EEMC received for the sale.  Has there been any 
conversation about the benefits that may ultimately flow back to EES/EEMC in 
consideration for their transfer of these receivables to EPMI?  While the 
attached amendment is not intended to address the assignment of that 
receivable, it may be beneficial to make reference to those benefits in this 
amendment.     

3. The January 17, 2001 assignment transferred that portion of the negative 
CTC that had accrued to date, but we have not effected any transaction to 
transfer the risk of the remaining marked position to EPMI.  There was some 
discussion of an EES/EPMI "swap" that would transfer the risk in the 
remaining position to EPMI.  Is that still being contemplated?

Subject: FERC reports on Plant Closures in Callifornia and Northwest Prices 
in Nov & Dec

Good News.  FERC issued three reports yesterday:  a Response of the Staff of 
the FERC to Questions Posed at December 20, 2000 Western Governors 
Association Denver Meeting; a Staff Report to the FERC on Northwest Power 
Markets in Nov. and Dec. 2000; and a Report on Plant Outages in the State of 
California.  All three reports can be downloaded from FERC's page on bulk 
power markets, found at http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm. 

>From a quick scan of the pricing and outage reports, the results are very 
favorable.  FERC found no evidence that plants were down for other than 
maintenance or emissions problems.  The pricing report found that prices in 
the NW during the two months tracked the increased demand and supply 
shortfall.

Attached is a discussion memo outlining the important points to think about 
before we decide whether or not to exercise our five year option under the 
recently signed EEI Agreement with CDWR.  The legal team is presently 
scheduled to review the matter by way of a conference call at  9:00 am 
Central / 7:00 am Pacific tomorrow,  and following that session, I am going 
to schedule a meeting with Chris Calger, Tim Belden and any of the credit 
team that may wish to join.  By the end of the day tomorrow, we should all 
have made a thorough review of this issue.

Here are three of the orders discussed at the Lynch conference.  Missing is
the Wood PD on QF pricing.  This email includes Lynch's proposal for rate
design on the extra 3 cent increase, the Walwym PD which calls for no
increase, and the Lynch Alt. which calls for an additional 3 cent /kWhr to
be allocated only to usage over 130% of baseline.  The rate increase for
large customers is subject to different limits.    She is refusing the say
Davis supports their plan.  More later.    Mike Day

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

Subject: Electronic Copy of Complaint Against PX


I've attached an electronic copy of the complaint, which has been filed 
within the past hour.  Hard copies that also include the cover letter, Fed. 
Reg. notice, and Appendix for service list are being mailed to all persons on 
FERC's service list in EL00-95-000 (the San Diego complaint proceeding).

Thanks to all who contributed to this project; it was truly a group effort.  
And special thanks to the nine companies that agree to join as signatories.

For those companies that did not join in, we encourage you to intervene ASAP 
in support of the complaint, including the request for an immediate 
suspension of the chargeback before the next round of chargeback invoices 
come due (which we believe could be as early as Feb. 15).  Since we are 
asking FERC to suspend the chargeback no later than Feb. 14, your immediate 
intervention would be very helpful.

Thanks again.  Ron

Please see below  the  information requested a legislator in California.  
Most of this information is already available but I do not know how much we 
want to disclose. 
 Please plan to meet at 7:30 am on Monday in 8C1 for us to pull together our  
materials and decide what we can disclose so weI can forward to the lobbyist 
by open of business in California.  I will get a call in number for those not 
able to attend.  

Marty and Don:  can you determine if the ENA folks that are on this memo need 
to attend ? I am uncertain about how  we handled the contracts we have with 
ENA, or how much we want to disclose about our relationship with ENA, since 
we have not really  been asked these types of questions before.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,

 After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on
options:

1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER
 Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that
is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,
then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection
and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent
 protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled
to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully
disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of
simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our
formal objections as well.

2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS
 Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for
electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway
either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging
litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might
slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by
seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the
legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this
information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how
confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It
might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron
information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential
proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive
advantage.

3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF
DATA FROM ISO AND PX.
 We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO
and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing
data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of
California data and would sidestep for the
 moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron
cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC
 would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss
picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the
combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need
to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.

4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE
 This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not
reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the
profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is
what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we
 would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and
loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX
data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be
quite large, but just not the cost or expense side.

5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA
 We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position
for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not
entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest
email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)
than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the
transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss
information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner
Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get
money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation
by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice
that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing
this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public
disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to
do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market
participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This
may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the
PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political
environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It
also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00
report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal
objections and sit back and  wait.

6. ME TOO
 Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other
market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is
modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This
makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert
and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read
Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if
the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their
offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says
the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be
met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California
constitutional contempt authority.

7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ
 Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the
PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the
ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It
has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading
the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the
PUC has no jurisdiction.
 Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted
contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that
they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take
the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our
appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at
the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our
objections might be at the ALJ level.

8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA
 We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power
Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC
issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC
has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the
wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light
v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated
by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.
New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state
agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale
market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more
even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a
cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the
information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless
we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of
the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that
this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG
in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same
information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,
anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders
etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if
FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.

9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES
 It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland
General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those
entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely
to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight
we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for
example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and
not able to participate in any change of direction discussions.

Hope this is helpful.
Thanks
Gary

Richard and Elizabeth:  
While I was away on vacation, Steve Hall included this statement in a status 
report to me;  

" >While you were gone I learned a new one from Smith Day, which involves 
submitting bids for less than one MW, i.e., .0005 MW.  Because of a glitch in 
the ISO's rounding system, the MW get rounded down, but the payment gets 
rounded up.  Playing this game is worth about $9000/day. "

9,000 X 365 = 3,250,000.

Let's discuss.  ----cgy

We continue to perform on our PX block forward sales.  Rather than deliver to 
Edison and PG&E, the PX has unilaterally decided to schedule this power as 
"load deviation" in the ISO market.  That is, it is an uninstructed deviation 
in the ISO Ex Post market so it receives the "dec" price.  This poses two 
problems.  First, the Ex Post price is a max of $150/MWh while the bilateral 
market trades significantly above this price.  Second, the ISO has payed us 
$0.02 for every $1.00 of sales that EPMI made to them in November.  We are 
racking up a receivable on this stuff of approximately $1 million per week 
(average sales price of $69.50 times a quantity of 150 peak MW).  Now the 
state has come in and taken the block forward positions.  We need to look at 
whether we must continue to perform on this obligation.
