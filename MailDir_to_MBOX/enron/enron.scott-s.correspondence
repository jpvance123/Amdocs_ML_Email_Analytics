Hey,

My car actually works.  Can you believe it.  Now I can take you to movies and 
we can actually watch them but somehow I think watching a movie at home is 
just a tad more fun.

I'll drive you to the airport tonight...IF I get to come over for a swim 
Sunday. (Believe me, my motives are purely selfish - your pool is so much 
"cooler" than mine.)

-- By the way, even with our slight car problem I had a great time last 
night.  You're really going to have to stop being so much fun to be around or 
you'll never be able to successfully ditch me (although last night was a 
valiant effort).

I know how much you're looking forward to "Ted's Weekend of Rest and 
Relaxation" and I also realize that carting me back and forth to the car 
dealership wasn't exactly on your list of things to do (bear in mind the 
dealership is roughly 5 minutes from your apartment)...So, I'm offering you 
an out.  I can find someone else to help me if you want to bail (I know how 
important your pool-side time is - Remember it's all about you and your 
needs."  Just let me know.



FYI:  Galveston does not look like this...

Hey,

We just came back from a quick happy hour run with our old MD and now it is 
back to work.  It looks like we will be here for a while and not be able to

kind enough to point out my failure to do so and add to my already heavy 
feelings of guilt.  Anyway, I know you guys are working hard getting your 
presentation ready, but if you need a break I'm planning on meeting a friend 
at Kenneally's tonight for a little pizza and beer.  Let me know if you have 
any interest in collecting...if not, you can just hold on to your raincheck

Ted,

Getting back to work has been a bit of a challenge after a weekend of 
indulgence and excess.  It took everything I had to get in the car and start 
the drive back to Houston Tuesday night (especially since I stopped by my 
sister's and tooled around on Lake Austin in the boat for a while before 
heading out).  As for the birthday shot, you are quite welcome - it was the 
least I could do.  

After my expenditures over the holiday, I will definitely be in town this 
weekend.  So, dinner Saturday sounds good.  As it stands right now, I am 
having a very pleasant day and I hope you are as well.

Susan

Susan,

How is getting back to work after living the high life in Austin?  Thanks 
again for the birthday shot and I wanted to see if you were free this weekend 
for dinner - say Saturday night (being the well organized guy that I am - I 
lost your home number otherwise I would have called).  Hopefully, you are 
having a good day and I'll talk to you later.

Ted

I just don't know where to start with the last couple of sentences so I will 
let any jokes pass for now but be afraid.  As for the people on the list, I 
know them as follows:

John Massey: SMU, UT b-school, emissions trader and a funny guy - spent a few 
drunken nights with him and he lives in your complex
Milind Pasad: India, UT b-school, really nice guy but no drinking or meat 
eating (he drove me to get my car on Monday)
Kevin Ruscitti: UCLA mba and trades gas, nice guy
Claudio Riberto: works in my old group with Milind, very smart MIT mba nice 
but quiet

I hope this helps and if you have any other questions, just let me know you 
little hottie.

Hey,
 
I know you are monumentally busy this week, but if you get five minutes today 
shoot me back an email and let me know if you know any of the Associates 
below.  They are all going to be at the dinner tonight so any info that would 
boost my B.S. factor would be much appreciated.  I seem to remember you 
mentioning John Massey on a couple of occasions but I have, albeit very 
rarely, been known to be wrong.  Hope your day is going well and that you 
aren't having to carry Darren too much.

me.)

Susan,

Well you have either had a week from hell so far or its just taking you time
to come up with some good bs.  Without being too forward I will be in town
next Friday and wanted to know if you would like to go to dinner or
something.  At least that will give us a chance to talk face to face.  If
your busy don't worry about it I thought I would just throw it out there.

I'll keep this one short and sweet since the last one was rather lengthy.
Hope this Thursday is a little better then last week.

Kyle

Okay, I'm dying to know...What was wrong with the car?  

Along those same lines, did you get them to bring the car to you here or do 
you have to go get it.  (Don't forget I need to get your parking pass to you.)

As for the home vs. theater viewing...I seem to be more of a home-body these

Hey Shorty,

Sorry your week has been going poorly (I guess you feel like I did Wednesday 
night).  But on the bright side, college football starts this weekend which 
is always a plus and today is Friday which makes this bad week over.  I am in 
middle of packing once again for another move but the good news is that I get 
kicked out by 5:00 today.  I was checking out UT schedule and it looks like 
they have a pansy schedule (unlike UCLA that has to play Alabama #3 and 
Michigan #4 early in the season).  Any comments on that?

Thursday night was indeed a blast.  I think my cohorts were ruing my 
existence by the end of the evening because I didn't have to go to work 
Friday (wedding in Dallas...very fun).  I'm sure you managed to have an all 
right time in SF as well.  I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this 
week.  It's supposed to be sunny and warm all week long and I can think of 
nothing that goes better with that than cold beer.  As for Austin, I have a 
wealth of information on the subject that I would be more than happy to 
share.

This may appear to be somewhat of a random email, but I assure you there 
exist some semblence of reason.  I remembered you mentioning that neither you 
nor Pat have ever made a pilgramige to Blanco's.  So...I thought I should let 
you know that there is live music and cold beer on tap tonigt at the Big B.  
Anyway it should be pretty good.  Music starts at 9:00.

Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in 
this case the Big D)

The play was very good and I think well received.  I'd forgotten how blown 
away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.  The cast 
members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of 
the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).  I 
caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office 
(yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).  Anyway, I'm sure 
I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.  As a result of 
that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my 
enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely 
obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).  

Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself 
since I failed to do so the last time we went.  I should let you know though 
that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right 
in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.  So was Darren there last 
night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?  She's a 
very fun girl.  

Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch.  
Good luck with all of the "fun" meetings.

Shorty

-- Due to the lack of response yesterday, I'm beginning to worry about your 
success with the road test...I'm going to assume that you didn't get around 
to it.

Smart girl.  I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a 
girl for Darren.  Anyway, lots of fun meetings today.  I'll talk to you later.

Hey yourself, 

Actually, my day is going very well.  It just so happens that my trader is 
out of town all week so, except for a few stressful phone calls this morning 
to assess the market, the day has been relatively uneventful.  All I want to 
know is how do I get your hours (or should I say lack thereof).  Anyway, my 
roommate and I had already made plans for tonight, but a movie tomorrow night 
sounds good.  Just fill me in on the details.  

Susan

Hey,

Well, I figured you could use a joke after dealing with your trader (read 
below).  Hopefully, his positions are doing better today than yesterday so 
your life is a tad more pleasant.  The movie is playing a regular intervals 
(7:30, 8 & 9) so that should give us some flexibility in getting some food 
and then seeing the movie.  I'll talk to you later about the details.

Ted

By the way, when you have some free time check-out (this goes with the whole 
boots, blue jeans, white T-shirts theme).  You have to love free time in 
Enron Net Works.

I think your plan sounds fine.  I'm not sure there is
too much he can do to talk his way completely out of
it.  I just don't like the fact that he has been such
a weirdo lately.  It sounds like he just may have a
flaw of some type.  I guess if he had a serious
girlfriend come back into his life or something, maybe
that would explaing things.  Otherwise, if he was
goint through some type of other trauma, you would
think he would share it with you.  I can't wait to
find out how it goes.  Molina's sounds great, what a
place to make a tense situation more relaxed.  The
phone call is a must, I wouldn't answer any more e
mails from him (ever!).

About Korea...I'm glad you are still coming over.  It
will be fine that you are coming with your parents.
We'll just drag them along with whatever we want to
do.  I don't recall them ever slowing us down before!

Have fun in London.  Do you have any Enron interviews
scheduled?  I'm sure you and Emily are going to have a
lot of fun.  I hope you like the London office.  I
guess you may have heard our latest.  We filed all of
the paperwork electronically for our follow-on
assignment after Korea.  We ranked Germany, Hawaii,
Savannah, Ft. Bragg (NC) and Ft. Campbell (KY) in that
order.  The guys e mailed us back and said he wouldn't
be able to get us Europe or Hawaii and that Savannah
is "overstrength" and that he would probably need us
at Campbell.  Needless to say, we are both furious
about getting our last choice.  Not necessarily with
the base, but with our lack of selection.  Ft.
Campbell wouldn't have even been in our list if it
wasn't the only place left where Chinooks go.  It
really ticks me off that hard work just doesn't pay
off in the Army.  We didn't get an option coming out
of Korea, we got an assignment.  What's the incentive
to do your job well, and most importantly, what is the
incentive to stay in.  I'm so mad that we don't have
any say in our next assignment and that Chuck could
likely get Korea again after that.  Gotta love the
Army.

It's not a done deal, I've got to get Chuck fired up a
little to fight this whole thing.  The guy said he'd
get back to us in a few weeks and let us know for
sure.  I hope we can beat him with a response and at
least try and negotiate with him.  We may even extend
6 months in Korea if it will make a difference.

Ft. Campbell is an hour outside of Nashville, TN.  I
think there are nice areas to live in closer to
Nashville.  Maybe we could live halfway in between and
I could work in Nashville and Chuck could commute a
little to work.  I just hate the idea of living in
another small town for another 2-3 years.  Enterprise
was enough.  We'll keep you posted.  Maybe it will
work out for the best anyway.  Maybe this is how Chuck
is going to get his big fixed wing break.

Let me know how the whole Ted thing goes, and we'll
start planning for your visit.

Chris

Let's plan on heading over there around 8:00-8:30 so there is absolutely no 
hurrying after work.  Steak night is a time of leisure so take all the time 
you need to get home, change and relax before heading out.  I live at the 
Park at River Oaks (West Alabama & Buffalo Speedway on Buffalo Speedway--from 
your place just take a right on Buffalo Speedway and its the first place on 
your left) and the only entrance has a guard and he will call up to my place 
to let you in.  Park at any labelled guest spot (left side of the up ramps 4 
floors) and my place is #3309 - closest building to the corner of Buffalo 
Speedway and West Alabama.  Now I am really tired from all this typing.

By the way, a maid service is coming to clean my place tomorrow afternoon.  
Quite a coincidence ... hmmm

Hey Math-Wiz,

I completely understand your plight.  I too am suffering a two o'clock, 
post-lunch slump (the coffee is simply not working at this point).  Anyway, I 
think a change of clothes prior to Steak Night is probably a good idea.  
Also, driving tomorrow is not a problem... just let me know the gate code, 
apt. #, etc.  Along those same lines, what time did you want to head over 
there?  (For better-safe-than-sorry reasons, due to my job, I think no 
earlier than 7:30 p.m. is our best bet.)

Hope you're having a lovely day and don't work too hard (Ha!!).

Hey,
 
I know you are monumentally busy this week, but if you get five minutes today 
shoot me back an email and let me know if you know any of the Associates 
below.  They are all going to be at the dinner tonight so any info that would 
boost my B.S. factor would be much appreciated.  I seem to remember you 
mentioning John Massey on a couple of occasions but I have, albeit very 
rarely, been known to be wrong.  Hope your day is going well and that you 
aren't having to carry Darren too much.

Evan Betzer
Jay Epstein
Bill Keeney
John Massey
Milind Pasad
Kevin Ruscitti
Jennifer Adams
Farzad Farhangnia
Gautam Gupta
Claudio Ribeiro
Doug Sewell

-- I finally watched the movie last night.  I laughed, I cried...it became a 
part of me.  Honestly though, it was a very funny flick.  So did John or 
Fritz pass along the "Bible" to you?  (Whoever it was you can thank them for 
me.)

So are you up for any friendly or unfriendly bets on this weeks big show
down?  I don't think the lines are out yet but I'm sure you guys will be
favored by at least a touchdown.  So I'll take the Aggies +7.  How about the
loser either picks up the first round or the whole night the next time we
hit the town, although the later might be pretty steep.  Don't know if your
a gambling gal but I thought I would at least present this opportunity to
you.

Anyway, how's the old option book?  Are you getting a handle on the whole
macro thing?  Look on the bright side it is only a three day week and I'm
sure you'll get the whole 40 in.

Take it easy.

Kyle

Hey Shorty,

I am glad to hear that today is going a little better.  We are getting a tad 
busy.  I hope the beers were good last night, and I thought about a couple of 
cold ones as Darren and I were getting finished around 1:30 this morning.  A 
drink sounds good but I may be leaving for Austin tomorrow night after work 
to pick up my friend Mark at the Austin airport (I'll find out later tonight) 
and if that is the case then we'll get one next week.  I think the story 
below is funny.  I'll talk to you later when I get a better sense of what is 
going on.

Ted

Hey Pavarotti,

Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big 
presentation tomorrow.  My day is going significantly better than yesterday 
so I am pleased.  Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me 
that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of 
the season on Navy Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  By 
the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't 
you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly 
by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always 
get the two confused).

Now for the rule-breaking.  I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to 
see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink 
after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I 
hope you can forgive my rudeness).  Both you and Darren looked pretty whipped 
last night and I'm sure tonight will be more of the same...You better be 
careful, I think this project is starting to give you gray hair.

Shorty

- - I forgot to tell you last night that my 5 yr. old niece got in trouble on 
the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye.  
Evidently, he was bothering she and her friend Reagan...I think my sister's 
biggest fears have now been confirmed, little Sally may have taken after her 
Aunt Sue Sue a little too much.

Shorty,

What's going on young lady.  Hopefully, your week is starting off well.  
Things were busy Sunday night through yesterday and don't appear to let up 
very much (although our idea most likely will get the axe in the short 
term).  Well, have to run (Darren is calling) but I'll give you a call later 
today.

Ted

You can always relieve a little stress by doing the 'Dubya Dance'.

Don't work too late.

How was the play?  I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re-run 
Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11:30.  
Smart girl.  I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a 
girl for Darren.  Anyway, lots of fun meetings today.  I'll talk to you 
later.

Ms. Sissy Crawford,

Thanks for the update on UT games.  Love those Aggies.  I heard Enron is 
going to sponsor a badminton player at the Olympics and of course you came to 
mind.  I need a review of the Bond film -- you seemed to be paying very close 
attention to it while I was a tad distracted, hopefully you can tell me about 
it.  I hope you are having a good day and I'll talk to you later.

Bo

First off I hope your still not at work when I send this.

Secondly it would be cool to meet earlier in the week but I'm in San Antonio
and will be until Friday.  I will be driving to Houston on Friday morning to
do some packing and then the parents will be coming up on Saturday morning
to help with the final move.  I will pretty much leave it in your ball park
about Friday night.  I know you have been working long hours and Friday is
just a bad day.  Even though I would like to see you, if you have a repeat
of last week then I understand if you want to call it off.  In that case
maybe we can meet up some other time.  Although I do remember a girl telling
me once that weekends are her time and she was going to go out no matter
what.

Let me know what you think and I'll probably give you a call Friday
afternoon to see how things are going.

Kyle

Well you do look good in those pants...maybe too good.  To finish off the 
outfit you will need the leopard print cowboy hat.  My flight on America West 
2275 (Phoenix to Houston) arrives at 7:30 at Terminal B (IAH).  I am assuming 
you will be picking me up with the new hat on.  Don't forget to bring your 
suit you little hottie.

Shorty,

I hope your day is going well.  Nothing like being busy with meetings. You 
may have seen this clip before but I thought I would share it with you in 
case you need a laugh after jury duty.  Enjoy a beer for me at Keenelleys 
(sp?).

Hey Shorty,

How is your day going?  Hopefully, it is going well.  Let me know when you 
think you will be free tonight to go home, relax and then be ready to head 
out.  I will make the reservations accordingly.  I'll talk to you later.

While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of 
these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now 
more appropriate than ever.

One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when 
they trust.  Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's 
level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause 
irreparable harm.  If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is 
violated it colours every aspect of your life.  There are too many people in 
this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born 
that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times 
that trust was thrown back in their face.  I don't mean to suggest from the 
above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather 
that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses.  
I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing 
and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a 
great deal more about them and their character.  The smallest acts and 
statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes 
listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of 
people whom you respect.)

To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically 
reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.  That beyond the hype and 
self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, 
cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always 
be a part of us.  I think that only by recognizing those components and 
trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger.

You forget that I have a sister-in-law with many single women friends beyond 
the age of 30 who actually have attempted to change their dating luck with 
this book.  I think the very fact they read/apply this book is a great 
indication of why they are still unattached.  Everybody knows the fastest way 
to a man's heart is through espn and college football the prerequisite being 
of course the lady has the Southern charm/accent, blonde hair and preferably 
blue eyes (but hazel will do in a pinch assuming everything else is there).  
See, men are not that selective or demanding.

Hey Bo,

I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way 
tickets from New Orleans.  It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase 
ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do 
offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).

Sissy

By the way,  I didn't  even realise John Cleese and Denise Richards were in 
the movie...and evidently at some point Bond hijacks a submarine.  Roger 
Ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We 
may have to watch this one at some point.

              "The World Is Not Enough" is a splendid comic thriller, 
exciting and graceful,
               endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th James Bond 
movie, it comes with so
               much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to 
earlier famous vintages; I
               guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one.

Let's plan on heading over there around 8:00-8:30 so there is absolutely no 
hurrying after work.  Steak night is a time of leisure so take all the time 
you need to get home, change and relax before heading out.  I live at the 
Park at River Oaks (West Alabama & Buffalo Speedway on Buffalo Speedway--from 
your place just take a right on Buffalo Speedway and its the first place on 
your left) and the only entrance has a guard and he will call up to my place 
to let you in.  Park at any labelled guest spot (left side of the up ramps 4 
floors) and my place is #3309 - closest building to the corner of Buffalo 
Speedway and West Alabama.  Now I am really tired from all this typing.

Ted

By the way, a maid service is coming to clean my place tomorrow afternoon.  
Quite a coincidence ... hmmm

Hey Math-Wiz,

I completely understand your plight.  I too am suffering a two o'clock, 
post-lunch slump (the coffee is simply not working at this point).  Anyway, I 
think a change of clothes prior to Steak Night is probably a good idea.  
Also, driving tomorrow is not a problem... just let me know the gate code, 
apt. #, etc.  Along those same lines, what time did you want to head over 
there?  (For better-safe-than-sorry reasons, due to my job, I think no 
earlier than 7:30 p.m. is our best bet.)

Hope you're having a lovely day and don't work too hard (Ha!!).

going home to change into some casual/hot weather clothes before dinner

Thanks for the info...you are a wealth of knowledge.  As for the jokes, I am

there will, at some point, be appropriate pay-back.

I just don't know where to start with the last couple of sentences so I will 
let any jokes pass for now but be afraid.  As for the people on the list, I 
know them as follows:

John Massey: SMU, UT b-school, emissions trader and a funny guy - spent a few 
drunken nights with him and he lives in your complex
Milind Pasad: India, UT b-school, really nice guy but no drinking or meat 
eating (he drove me to get my car on Monday)
Kevin Ruscitti: UCLA mba and trades gas, nice guy
Claudio Riberto: works in my old group with Milind, very smart MIT mba nice 
but quiet

I hope this helps and if you have any other questions, just let me know you 
little hottie.

Fifth grade assignment

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess."  "And what's the moral of 
the story?" Asked the teacher.  "Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!"  "Very good," said the teacher.  

"Now, Lucy?"  

"Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched."  "That was a fine story Lucy."

"Johnny do you have a story to share?"  

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands."
"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "What kind of moral 
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"

"Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking."

Hey Handsome,

I am taking every step to ensure that I leave this building at a reasonable 
hour today.  Unfortunately, it is "bid-week" (Nat Gas trading thing which 
translates to beaucoup deals/trading) so the odds are somewhat stacked 
against me.  Anyway, I'm going to say that as it stands right now 8:00 p.m.

Hey Shorty,

How is your day going?  Hopefully, it is going well.  Let me know when you 
think you will be free tonight to go home, relax and then be ready to head 
out.  I will make the reservations accordingly.  I'll talk to you later.

Hey Britney,

Oh don't you fret young lady, we are still on for dinner at the good 
restaurant tomorrow.  I figure a nice place is in order every couple of times 
we go out and you know how much I enjoy your smart-ass attitude.

As for the pick up, the Sissy Crawford taxi is at your service.  Just name 
the time and place.  Also, there is no need to forego the nice fun restaurant 
for tomorrow night just because I have to be a smart-ass every once in a

Hey Bo,

I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way 
tickets from New Orleans.  It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase 
ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do 
offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).

Sissy

By the way,  I didn't  even realise John Cleese and Denise Richards were in 
the movie...and evidently at some point Bond hijacks a submarine.  Roger 
Ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We 
may have to watch this one at some point.

              "The World Is Not Enough" is a splendid comic thriller, 
exciting and graceful,
               endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th James Bond 
movie, it comes with so
               much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to 
earlier famous vintages; I
               guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one.

There is nothing wrong with simple and understated when it comes to a 
non-native Texan acquiring western wear.  Remember slow and steady wins the 
race.  One needs items they could wear at any given time (Red Wings a simple 
classic hat)...not just to the Vail Rodeo.

Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier...I think 
you may be adhering to it too faithfully.  At this rate we may have to start 
pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things.  However, having 
driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to 
pass the test with flying colors.  Keep in mind though that if you end up 
failing I will not let you forget it (and, as we have established, I have the 
memory of an elephant).  

I'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 
32.  Now back to what's really important...you.  Thought you'd like to know 
that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing 
just down the street from you at the Compaq Center...it's all about you and 
your needs.

Hey,

My week is actually going very well so far (my trader left around noon so 
today should be a piece of cake).  I know you
guys have been working really hard the last couple of days, but I hope it 
paid off and the presentation went well 
yesterday.  However, given your comment about y'alls idea getting the axe in 
the short term, I'm not sure that was 
necessarily the case.  Anyway, I'm sure at least your steak dinner was a hit 
(so were you able to resist the red wine 
this time, you lush?).  

In keeping with my very serious nature (yes, you heard me serious), I've 
attached little story for you...I got a pretty
good chuckle out of this one.

PS. - Thanks again for carting me around and feeding me Saturday...I, as 
usual, had a great time.  Oh, and by the way, kudos to both of us for 
actually making it through a home movie

What's going on young lady.  Hopefully, your week is starting off well.  
Things were busy Sunday night through yesterday and don't appear to let up 
very much (although our idea most likely will get the axe in the short 
term).  Well, have to run (Darren is calling) but I'll give you a call later

Yes...I am a true Longhorn.  I think that's why I like Steak Night so much.  
I mean how can you beat sitting on a deck, drinking a beer and solving the 
words problems (OK., 2 out of 3 ain't bad).  Anyway, Wednesday night sounds 
good to me, although, given how work has been going lately I doubt I'll be 
able to get there before 7:30.  Just do me a favour and forewarn Pat that 
Emily may be attending so he can prepare properly (I don't want any 
bloodshed).  I think a couple co-workers are also planning on coming so it 
should a good group.

Hey Shorty,

I just got back into town from Memphis (they really like Elvis) and 
Washington D.C., so that explains the delay in getting back to you.  I got my 
car detailed at Dream's car wash on San Felipe (just before Target).  They do 
a good job but don't get all the extra stuff they want to sell you.  I hope 
you had a fun Halloween weekend/last night and after Oklahoma dismantled 
Nebraska, the Longhorn whooping doesn't look that bad anymore (...but Texas 
in the top 20?).

Hey,

Quick question, I was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and I 
remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back...I was wondering 
where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job ( I'm assuming 
the place is pretty close to our area of town).  I finally got into the 
parking garage and have decided I now have real incentive to keep my car 
looking nice.

Hope things are well with you.  I talked to Darren last week and it sounds as 
though he is extremely busy these days.  I'm guessing the story's much the 
same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.  
Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.

Susan

By the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat 
two weeks from now (Tech in Lubbock is never a safe bet) - and while neither 
season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU 
- one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your 
beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.  Oh well, c'est la 
vie.

Fifth grade assignment

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess."  "And what's the moral of 
the story?" Asked the teacher.  "Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!"  "Very good," said the teacher.  

"Now, Lucy?"  

"Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched."  "That was a fine story Lucy."

"Johnny do you have a story to share?"  

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands."
"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "What kind of moral 
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"

"Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking."

Yes it is true that my pool is much cooler than yours and Sunday sounds 
good.  I think I get in around 7:30 Sunday night but I will pass along the 
details when I pick up my e-ticket.  No need for a ride out there (you should 
enjoy your happy hour) but I will need one coming back on Sunday if that 
works with you.  I had fun last night as well and again you looked great and 
I had my usual good time just hanging out with you.  My place will be a 
disaster when we get back but what can you do.  Thanks for the ride in this 
morning and dropping off the movies. I'll talk to you later.  I hope your day

you'll never be able to successfully ditch me (although last night was a 
valiant effort).

Ted,

I think you had, at one point, asked me if the first U.T. football game was 
Labor Day weekend.  It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9) 
against Louisiana-Lafayette at 11:30 a.m.  So basically it should be a very 
challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).  Hope your day's going well.

FYI - U.T. plays Stanford at Stanford Sept. 16 (7:15 p.m. kick-off)

4. You come upon his secret stash of colorful socks. 
  
3. Uses slang expression: "Talk to the hand, cause the beard ain't 
listening." 
  
2. Was recently pulled over for "driving under the influence of cottage 
cheese."

Ted, 

I tried to send this page a little while ago and I think it failed.  So, you 
may have to actually drop this address into the netscape location section to 
bring up the site.

Anyway, there seemed to be a pretty good selection on the web.  Still, I 
think the one on this page best captures the kind of image you're looking to 
project.

If you'd rather shop around try these (there are some outstanding designs)...

Since you may or may not return my call I thought I would shoot you an
email.  I'm sorry for keeping you out soo late on Wednesday and anything
else that you may be upset about.  Anyway I will be in Austin on Saturday
night and was hoping we could meet up.  The only thing is I have no way of
getting a hold of you.  So, here is my cell number and I should at least
have this until the end of November:  281-216-5005.  I already got Vic's and
Trey's number so maybe we can all hook up on sixth street.  You can always
respond to this or give me a call with your number.  I may swing by Purvi's
happy hour tonight so maybe I'll see you there.

Kyle

By the way I have never been married and I'm not 28 yet.

Ted,

My day is going quite well, actually.  I managed to sleep in past 6:30 a.m. 
this morning and did not work-out so I'm feeling pretty good.  I'm not sure 
if I'll be able to respect you in the light of your "rule-breaking", but I'm 
going to try to look past that.  I'm heading to lunch right now - yes, I am 
actually leaving the building - so the day just keeps getting better and 
better.  As for last night, I had a really good time too and am glad you were 
able to look past my bad manners and agree to go out Friday.  Talk to you 
soon.

Susan

-- By the way, I'm very relieved to hear about the buckle.

Shorty,

I hope your day is going well and your trader and thus you are having a good 
day.  I just realized that I broke the "rules" last night.  I should say no 
to a Friday night out when asked out on Wednesday night but I'll let it go 
this time because we are going country and you are breaking out the t-shirt 
and jeans.  When I think about it, that exception applies to every 
situation.  I had fun last night and I think you will be relieved to know 
that I can't get my huge belt buckle on order and shipped in time for 
tomorrow so you are in the clear.

Ted

a firm believer in the one strike and you're out thoery, and of course,
based on a, his behavior in the last few weeks, b., the sage words of his
'trusty' friend kevin, who DID give your parents the time of day, c., his

i have to admit, when i saw the copyline for this, i began to panic.  i
pictured you in a drunken about- to-go-over the edge rage....and then ted
stumbling onto the scene, and you unloading.  however, in lieu of the facts,
i'd say this was an unequivicable 'victory', if such a word can be used....
i think it's fair to say that you ended up w/ more on your side of the
tug-of-war rope, so to speak.  and although it's frustrating to see what
once seemed to be 'potential' turn into shit, it's easier to walk away- at
least i'd imagine it to be.  sounds like you're going to have a whirl-wind
trip- guess enron only can open the gates of hell to let you out for brief
blocks of time......isn't that kind of like the myth about persephone
escaping from hades......?  will try to plan a suitable agenda- still in
ther 'dazed and confused' period- been more concerned w/ where i can find
trash bags than hopping bars so far, but will try to fine tune my skills in
the time remaining- must go to class, but will write more later.  hate to
say it, but you prob. will be saddled w/ a care package for me from mom-
will try to make it in the 80lbs or less range....

A good wit is a terrible thing to waste...

As for the pick up, the Sissy Crawford taxi is at your service.  Just name 
the time and place.  Also, there is no need to forego the nice fun restaurant 
for tomorrow night just because I have to be a smart-ass every once in a 
while.

Hey Bo,

I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way 
tickets from New Orleans.  It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase 
ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do 
offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).

Sissy

By the way,  I didn't  even realise John Cleese and Denise Richards were in 
the movie...and evidently at some point Bond hijacks a submarine.  Roger 
Ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We 
may have to watch this one at some point.

              "The World Is Not Enough" is a splendid comic thriller, 
exciting and graceful,
               endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th James Bond 
movie, it comes with so
               much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to 
earlier famous vintages; I
               guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one.

Hey, how was the weekend?  Did you at least catch up a little on your rest?
You had one heck of a week but then again I guess that is just old hat for
you.  We had a good time on Saturday.  It is always fun to be on sixth
street close to halloween, even more freaks come out.

OK enough stalling.  I just thought something needed to be said about
wednesday.  We could just go on and act like nothing happened and probably
never see or talk to one another ever again.  I don't like that solution.
My personality is to go with the flow but by doing this you sometimes miss
out on opportunities.  So the traditional me would say it was just one night
and didn't really mean anything, which could possibly be true.  One thing
that I learned from you is that you have to take chances and don't be
intimidated.  You have a very strong personality and I can see where
somebody could easily be intimidated.  Along with that comes someone who is
smart, attractive, outgoing, and somebody who can fit in anywhere, whether
your at the local honky-tonk or at some gala.  The one thing I know about
you is that your going to be successful and I don't mean in the monetary way
because I know that isn't high on the priority list.  I also know that if I
would have never left the company then I probably wouldn't be sitting here
writing this email.

When I was thinking about leaving I didn't think it was going to be that
hard.  I really didn't like the way my life was going and I knew I needed a
change.  Then I sit back and think of all the things I'm going to miss.
People bad talk risk all the time, with the long hours and little respect
you sometimes get it is understandable.  The thing I'm going to miss the
most are all the friendships I have built working in that group.  Sometimes
the toughest times are when you really get to know someone.  But the hardest
thing now is that I will not be around you.  I know that sounds really bad
but the honest truth is I have liked you ever since we started sitting next
to each other.  We had this chemistry and it made the job a little easier
knowing you were there.  I really think the best times I had in Houston were
those couple of weeks we went out after work to have a few drinks.  I also
knew that since we worked together that it probably wasn't the best thing to
get involved.  I really regret that decision right about now.

Alright I guess I have said a lot of sappy stuff and you should know that
I'm not usually like this, which is probably why I didn't call you to share
this info.  I do think some things need to be said or else the other person
will never know.  You are a great person and even though the chips are
stacked against me I needed to let you know this.  I understand that your
under a lot of stress right now and by no means do I want to add on.  The
one thing I wish you would take away from this is that if your 35 and still
looking then you need not look any further.

So I apologize for using this forum to express this I really wanted to talk
to you in person on Friday but I just didn't get a chance much less know
where to start. I hope we stay in touch and if you ever want to go to Gruene
Hall then let me know.  I also don't want to be put in one of your stalker
categories so take this for whatever you want, please don't think of me as
the next SP.

Take care and have a good week.

Kyle

By the way I think that good-bye would have to rank in top of all times, at
least it is number one in my book.

Hey,

Well the initial idea doesn't look good (presentation went very well though 
-- just not that great an idea) but other ag commodity products are being 
investigated by guess who: Darren and his trusty sidekick Ted.  As for the 
joke below, if you need me to explain it just let me know.  I had fun as well 
as on Saturday and I didn't drink that much last night but I ate so much that 
my belly hurt for hours.  I know life is tough.

Hey,

My week is actually going very well so far (my trader left around noon so 
today should be a piece of cake).  I know you
guys have been working really hard the last couple of days, but I hope it 
paid off and the presentation went well 
yesterday.  However, given your comment about y'alls idea getting the axe in 
the short term, I'm not sure that was 
necessarily the case.  Anyway, I'm sure at least your steak dinner was a hit 
(so were you able to resist the red wine 
this time, you lush?).  

In keeping with my very serious nature (yes, you heard me serious), I've 
attached little story for you...I got a pretty
good chuckle out of this one.

PS. - Thanks again for carting me around and feeding me Saturday...I, as 
usual, had a great time.  Oh, and by the way, kudos to both of us for 
actually making it through a home movie

Shorty,

What's going on young lady.  Hopefully, your week is starting off well.  
Things were busy Sunday night through yesterday and don't appear to let up 
very much (although our idea most likely will get the axe in the short 
term).  Well, have to run (Darren is calling) but I'll give you a call later

Hi yourself,

Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the 
impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it 
must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.

Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to 
Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and 
then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and 
then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there 
so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, 
walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting 
down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they 
had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up 
going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we 
parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell 
phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us 
Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it 
was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him 
one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday 
gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know 
each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the 
best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be 
sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels 
pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run 
through the stats:

Height :   6'2" - 6'3"
Weight : about 225 lbs.
Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where)
Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it 
may be more of an issue for him than me.
Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA

ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.
  Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)
  His dad was in the Navy
  Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of 
humor and likes to laugh
  He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in 
the hill country

Best Quotes:    "Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in 
jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots." 
  "Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has 
an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great    
businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and 
three of them are married."
  "Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker 
than any group of women I've ever met."
  "I really want to learn how to two step."
  
So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive 
characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every 
capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you 
informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, 
the job hunt and everything else is going.

Susan

Hey Susan,

What's with this new man who keeps popping up
everywhere?  I heard you have seen a lot of him
lately!  You'll have to e mail me back and fill me in
on the scoop.

We had a great time in Thailand.  They are right when
they say it is exotic.  We saw some pretty ronchy
things there, too.  I'm not sure it if were the old
men with the young boys and a million of those clubs
or if the clubs "featuring" women were worse.  Anyway,
we got to see and do some pretty interesting things
and ate some really good food.  Chuck is expanding his
palate (sp?).  Hope all is well in Houston!

Chris

Here I thought that the only true way into your Texas gal heart was through a 
new pair of stranglers and spotted snake-skin boots. I guess I'll have to go 
to find another way - maybe through a Hawaiian Biker ensemble.

Ted, 

I tried to send this page a little while ago and I think it failed.  So, you 
may have to actually drop this address into the netscape location section to 
bring up the site.

Anyway, there seemed to be a pretty good selection on the web.  Still, I 
think the one on this page best captures the kind of image you're looking to 
project.

If you'd rather shop around try these (there are some outstanding designs)...

Thanks for the joke, it provided me with a well needed chuckle (You and 
Darren definitely have too much time on your hands).  As for the hat/casual 
western theme, we are going to have to go to make a trip to Blanco's or Tin 
Hall sometime so I can don the full regalia.

Hey,

I ran into Ann after lunch today and I remembered that y'all have a common 
friend who wanted to put you two in touch for volleyball.  I played briefly 
with Ann (who is quite the setter) before being removed from the team for 
"attitudinal differences".  Ann mentioned that she is currently playing once 
a week and may need another female player - I hope that doesn't play on 
Wednesday (steak night) or Thursday (Blancos, Deans etc.) because we know how 
important sitting outside and enjoying a cold beer is. Just chat with each 
other about it.  Otherwise, I hope both of your afternoons are going well.

Ted

uggggghhhh!!!  what a complete and utter pr--k!!  i am SO annoyed reading
that story!  so even aside from the evening with your parents (which
approaches being understandable) he never was mature at all. i don't have
anything insightful to add to this situation- he appeared so genuine and
wonderful, but deep inside, he is a Californian....i have never been
impressed with California men in general- too self important and unduly
cocky.  his loss completely, which you know.

At least you have your plane ticket to London!  I'm so excited for you- you
world traveller!  You should send out a bulk email update when you return
so that all your friends and family stay informed on your exciting
life....Some friends of mine from NYC who now live in SF are coming in town
this weekend, and we're going to a benefit party at the Zoo. should be
fun.   i thought of you also because the symphony called and invited me to
opening night of the Connoisseur Series- wish you were going to be here!

Talk to you soon.  And remember: beauty and grace is the best revenge!
Julie

Hey Math-Wiz,

I completely understand your plight.  I too am suffering a two o'clock, 
post-lunch slump (the coffee is simply not working at this point).  Anyway, I 
think a change of clothes prior to Steak Night is probably a good idea.  
Also, driving tomorrow is not a problem... just let me know the gate code, 
apt. #, etc.  Along those same lines, what time did you want to head over 
there?  (For better-safe-than-sorry reasons, due to my job, I think no 
earlier than 7:30 p.m. is our best bet.)

Hope you're having a lovely day and don't work too hard (Ha!!).

Susan

Hey Shorty,

I hope your day is going well.  We took our MD out for lunch because he is 
relocating to NY and will spend about a week in Houston a month.  Well, to 
make a short story long, we ate at Erma's (great food) but I am getting very 
sleepy (life is difficult I know) from eating way too much.  I assume we are 
going home to change into some casual/hot weather clothes before dinner 
tomorrow and I may need you to pick me up.  I am still looking for some good 
jokes that I can send to you that are funny but still moderately appropriate 
(most are completely inappropriate - I have sick friends).  Check out 
www.darwinawards.com for some funny but true stories.  I'll talk to you later.

Ted

Just because your trader is out of town on vacation doesn't mean he can't get 
a hold of you and make life less than pleasant.  How a person can be in 
Hilton Head, SC and still sound like he's going to have a heart attack is 
beyond me.

Hey,

I apologize for being out of touch recently but I was on vacation last week 
and this week has been busy.  Things seemed a bit awkward recently and I 
would like to see if we could get a beer and chat next week if you are free 
(after Tuesday night because I'll be in Amarillo talking to feedlot operators 
early next week). Enjoy your weekend and my condolences about UT's fall out 
of the top 10.

Ted

People,

Several of us are getting together to rent out the party room at
Cadillac Bar
on Friday night.  If you must have a reason, it is to celebrate life 
(or
you may pick one of your own personal triumphs to celebrate).

Please feel free to bring friends - we will start around 8 and it will
last until we get sick of each other.

Cadillac Bar is located at 1802 Shepherd near I-10.

See you there,
