Dave,

Just wanted to give you the a quick update on TIL.  GE is coming out to install Rev4 on Monday (see details below).  

As we discussed earlier today, Rev2 was installed at Caledonia in December, soon after signing PSA with Cinergy.  Rev4 is now out and available.  If we decide to run, we need Rev4.  GE called today to say that the tech is coming to Caledonia on Monday to install Rev4 (or if we delay, it will be two weeks).  Obviously we can't wait two weeks.  As required in the PSA, I called Cinergy (David Tang) to tell him that we are installing Rev4 on Monday and Tuesday and if they want to send someone to the plant to witness the control curve changes, to send someone out on Tuesday (GE's recommendation).  We will also have Ross Newlin from OEC at the plant.

In addition, we confirmed with Michelle April (GE Rep) today that we are still operating under the original TIL issued back in December (which you have a copy of).

Let me know if you need anything else.

Don

John/Louise,

I left a revised New Albany Analysis in each of your chairs.  John, I believe that the PV Margin number is the one that you were most interested in.  Please let me know if any explanation is needed or if this is not what you wanted.

Regarding the attached email, Don asked me to relay the following response.  First, it is relatively unlikely that the IDB will conclude that their approval is not necessary (according to Maria Elena the need for IDB consent is unambiguous).  Second, even if the IDB suggests that their approval is not necessary, there is another material condition precedent, CFC consent.  The CFC is the Mexican equivalent of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States and consent from the CFC is not expected for forty five days after filing (filing is anticipated for June 29, 2001).  Maria Elena is currently visiting with Cris Sherman to discuss our ability to book income given these two items and will get back with you shortly.  Please feel free to call with anything further.

Stuart

If IDB comes back today and says that the board of IDB does not need to approve this sale to Tractebel, they will probably still need to see docs etc.  BUT can we book it (this quarter?)

ENA entered into a purchase and sale agreement today to sell 80% of our Monterrey Project to Tractebel.  It is anticipated that it will take 60-90 days to get IDB and CFC approval, and have targeted a mid-August closing.  Some of you may be aware that Tractebel attempted to add a new CP at the last minute (last Monday).  We did not accept the CP but rather crafted another solution (thanks Maria Elena) of no real value to Enron but with optical value to Tractebel.

I will keep you all up to date as this transaction progresses.

Thanks,

Don

We have tentatively reached an arrangement with Duke regarding the repair work.  If closing takes place prior to completion of the repair work, Duke will assume control of the repairs and Enron will continue to pay actual invoices received in connection with the repair work so long as they are consistent with the agreed upon scope of work.

Currently the estimated costs are $1.45 Million (these have increased slightly from our prior conversations because of new problems uncovered when the generator was opened up).  We are reasonably certain that no further material problems should arise in the completion of the work and that the estimated cost is reasonable static.

On the insurance claim related to this work, I understand that the insurance company is balking at paying two components of the repair work which will likely (if this is their final, unchallenged position) result in the deductible exceeding the loss payable (i.e. no insurance proceeds payable to ENA).

Please feel free to call with any questions.

Stuart

Attached is a draft press release regarding Duke's purchase of our New Albany facility.  Duke expects to release late in the day on Thursday, June 28.  They will be meeting with the employees on Friday.

It is not much different than Cinergy's or AES's releases when they purchased peakers.  Please forward all comments to me at your earliest convenience.  While I am out of the office, I am accessing e-mail and voice mail or you can page me at 877-576-8750.  Thanks.

Louise,

We owe SG a little over $1 million dollars related to the advisory services for the Vitro sale.  I have been delaying the payment and putting them off the best that I can.  Somewhere in here, we need to pay them.  When do you think I can get clearance to pay them?

Thanks,

Louise,

Don mentioned that you were interested in the likelihood of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals on the sale to Duke.  

According to Andrews & Kurth, it is about 99% likely that we will ultimately receive the necessary Hart-Scott-Rodino approval from the DOJ / FTC.  It is possible, but not likely, that we will receive follow up questions and even a second request but we should be able to answer any such questions to the regulators' satisfaction.  A&K also cautioned that this 99% figure was a based on a quick analysis.

With respect to the required approval from the FERC, I was sure to speak to Sam Behrends of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene and MacRae (he worked on both of the other peaker sales) prior to finalizing the PSA about the likelihood of getting FERC approval.  He indicated that he thought it would be a "slam dunk" but I did not ask him to assign a numerical percentage figure to that.  I have a second call into him in order to get that number, but have not been able to reach him.  I will let you know ASAP.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Stuart

Three minute conversation - he is all done as far as he is concerned.  I did ask him on any issues he did say they wanted to shorten the right to match less than 18 months, but that was only in passing.

He also said the board will not even be discussing this but just wave it through under any other business.

That's it

The short news is that things are fine with application.

I spoke with Anthony Wilson of Allegheny who's been working with the SEC staff to get the order issued.  He expects to have the order either today or early next week.

Starting Monday, you can reach me at joanne.rutkowski@bakerbotts.com


I'll be back to you ASAP with other contact info.

best

Joanne

My understanding from legal was that Corporate Development as represented by Donahue and the business unit had to sign off.  He brought Mordaunt into the picture for his legal side.  I don't like going outside of EA anymore than you do, but according to established policy relayed to me through legal stand still and non-solicitation language requires this type of sign off.

I have given to your admin a copy of the Cogentrix CA and have bracketed the language that needs your approval.  Legal had originally told me that I needed Detmering and Donahue to sign off.  Detmering has told me that either you or Lavorato need to sign off.  Per my conversation with Donahue, he is o.k. because Kristina Mordaunt has signed off on the language.  

We have a little over a week to get a preliminary, non-binding bid in, if the original schedule holds, and we have held off as long as we can signing any language along these lines, but we are now starting to be backed against the wall.  This language represents the best we are going to be able to accomplish in this situation.

Louise,

As I mentioned in our meeting today, attached is a map with a general description of Orion's assets.  Given the location of Astoria, I am sure we would find it interesting.  However, it is generally understood in the market that Goldman is selling the company (not assets). 

I got to know these guys pretty well last year when we (Delainey and I) spent some talking with them about a JV with our peakers.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Don

Ben,

I have heard through the grape vine that concerns were raised this morning at your staff meeting about the Allegheny closing.  Just to clarify, we have set May 3, 2001 as the closing date.  On that date we should receive $1,028,000.00 plus $10-15 million for reimbursement of some cost associated with a build out of a sub station. 

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Don

Importance: High


Don,
 
This is a long e-mail and I apologize for that but since we have not had a chance to talk, I wanted to send you some information on Bistineau as well as the latest output from the Storage Group's M & A analysis.
 
The M&A analysis was just updated as they have been several reservoir transactions in the past few months (AEC @ Manchester, Atmos @ East Diamond, and Aquila @ Lodi).  Prior to these transactions we did not have enough data points to draw meaningful conclusions about the trends in reservoir acquisition.
 
I have attached the output for your review but I think a couple of points are key.
 

The reservoir curve is "hockey-sticking" just as the salt curve did previously.  While not as dramatic as salt, the premiums are increasing dramatically. 
The market is NOT placing a premium on optionality.  Salt is inherently more flexible than a reservoir, yet on a deliverability basis, there does not appear to be a significant difference.  That may explain why we see players who DO value optionality in the marketplace (Aquila, AEC, Duke, etc).  These companies have long established asset based storage groups and actively trade around these assets.

As far as Bistineau is concerned, there are several points worth highlighting.  I have attached output from the database maintained by the Storage Group for your reference. I have not included caverns but we do have that data.

Reliant Energy is part owner of the facility.  Reliant is aggressively trying to build a merchant storage business.  My group has bumped into them several times in the marketplace. 
Since the facility is federally regulated, Reliant and Koch would be required to make a NGA 7(b) filing to abandon the services they provide their customers before anyone could purchase the reservoir.  The length of this process would be a function of the number of intervenors.  
Bistineau is a very large reservoir with a large amount of native base gas.  How much of this volume is recoverable (and therefore monetizable) is a large question mark. 
Relative to its peers, Bistineau is a poor performer in terms of flexibility (low injection capabilities) 
Koch has, in the past, written off losses at Bistineau.  The low injection rate may be as a result of this.  I have not researched the exact amount of the losses but a seach of FERC filings would reveal the nature and extent of the losses.  Epps likewise has had some loss problems.

If Enron's intent is to establish a storage asset position in Louisiana, South Downsville would probably be the best candidate.  The field is privately held, under development, has many interconnects, and acquisition would probably meet little resistance given the lack of customers.  

While I have not communicated with Matrix in some time, I do know the principals and could easily get an update on their status and plans.

 

I will not be in tomorrow morning, but should you wish to discuss this e-mail, feel free to call me on my cell phone @ 713-825-2643.

Louise,

Stuart is officially coming over.  I have a meeting set with Oxley at 3:30 pm to discuss his and my contract.  I understand you want to meet with me at 4:00 pm.  I will there.

Louise,

I spoke with Victor yesterday and he said that the numbers we saw in our Cogentrix meeting reflect our standard QF valuation methodology including a residual value of $250 kW, grown at 2.5% until the end of the contracted period.  I had him do a sensitivity analysis by dropping the value to $100 kW and it only had a $50 million impact. 

Let me know if you have any additional thoughts.

Don

I plan on speaking with all the interested bidders in the morning to determine the big issues from a valuation perspective.  Thus far, almost every one has highlighted the recent decline in power prices (none bidders said size was an issue).  Once I have spoken with the bidders, we need to agree on the process of getting back to AIG.

Let me know if you all have any thoughts.

Thanks,

Don

We have a $1MM deductible.  We also have BI that will kick-in after 30 days (won't help much).  Stuart spoke to Jody and Wes, and they are looking for the right home for the charge.  But to answer your question, yes, it will hit income (the joys of owning and running an asset)!  Kevin has basically told the hourly desk, no more running.

I received word from Mike Morrell at Allegheny today that no SEC review of the S-3 will be required.  Obviously, one less potential delay to have to deal with.

Three minute conversation - he is all done as far as he is concerned.  I did ask him on any issues he did say they wanted to shorten the right to match less than 18 months, but that was only in passing.

He also said the board will not even be discussing this but just wave it through under any other business.

That's it

Just received a call from Sam Behrends at LeBoeuf.  He just spoke to the FERC about Cinergy 203.  They are working on 203 as we speak.  Appear to have everything that they need. He reminded them that we want to close this quarter.  Sam's best guess is early next week for order to be issued.  He said, once they finish writing order, it goes upstairs for a couple of days and then usually takes two days to get published.  Still leaves plenty of room for 1Q close (on or around the 27th).

I will let you know if I hear anything else.

Thanks,

Don

Jeff,

As we discussed, attached is a comprehensive list of the team and deals. As you know, Louise formally calls our team Asset Marketing. I tend to think that we play a number of roles including corporate development, CTG, deal structuring, and anything else that is required to get a deal done. 

In addition to the core team, I believe we also need to consider other issues related to asset sales including DealBench ("DB").  DB is a tremendous platform, that should be maintained.  It facilitates the sales process in so many ways, and would require very little to keep it alive.  Jon Hoff in our group can do almost anything related to DB and would probably require one engineer (not 100% of his time) to be available for DB to maintained.  

In addition to our team, the development group run by Ben Jacoby has been selling development sites, and Chris Calger has a team out west that has had a lot of success.  These groups (or a subset thereof), I believe should be maintained for the assets that they hold today and potentially other sales as well. 

Lastly, the asset sales that we are pursuing or have completed reflect a true team effort.  There has been and remains a core group of people that embrace every asset sale that we do.  People like Mike J. Miller, Mitch Robinson, and Ross Newlin contribute in many ways, and are great people to have around in discussing various issues including technical and operating issues.  Mitch and Ross have been to almost every plant in the Enron portfolio.  While it is true that we have technical people in Brazil or wherever, the question is whether they are capable and competent, and can they sell in front of a counterparty?  Additionally, most of the plants that we built were designed and managed from Houston.  In addition to these guys, as you well know, asset sales take people from tax, insurance, environmental permitting, etc.  We need to make sure these type of people are around, otherwise we end up with no incumbent knowledge base (I am sure you recognize all of this).

Sorry for the long email and I hope this helps.

Don

Attached is the FINAL version of the Allegheny Press Release that will be issued later today once the deal is officially closed. Please note that the price ($1.028 billion) will NOT be included in the release. I spoke with Allegheny and they agreed that it was not necessary to disclose the price. Other than deleting the price, no other changes have been made to this final version of the release. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I really appreciate all your help in moving so quickly on the approval process.

As many of you already know, we received 203 approval from the FERC on Friday and are scheduled to close in two days on Wednesday (9/26).  Please take all necessary actions in order to accomplish that goal and advise immediately if a Wednesday closing presents a problem.

Louise:

I have given to your admin a copy of the Cogentrix CA and have bracketed the language that needs your approval.  Legal had originally told me that I needed Detmering and Donahue to sign off.  Detmering has told me that either you or Lavorato need to sign off.  Per my conversation with Donahue, he is o.k. because Kristina Mordaunt has signed off on the language.  

We have a little over a week to get a preliminary, non-binding bid in, if the original schedule holds, and we have held off as long as we can signing any language along these lines, but we are now starting to be backed against the wall.  This language represents the best we are going to be able to accomplish in this situation.

Charlie

As Chuck mentioned in his voicemail, the Purchase Agreement for the general partnership interests in Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. was executed earlier today and the transactions contemplated thereby are expected to close near the end of this month.  An HSR filing is going to be made on Monday and the legal teams for both parties intend to seek early termination of the 30 day waiting period in order to expedite the closing.  El Paso is going to seek board approval for the transaction during the week of September 17th - 21st and must deliver notice of board approval no later than September 21st (this is a minor change from the DASH which identified the 19th as the outside approval date).

One other very important item of which you must be aware is that El Paso was very concerned about the confidentiality of this transaction and insisted that our agreement contain the following provision:

"No party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers, employees, representatives, consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information, all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information."
Please limit your disclosure of this transaction accordingly.

Regards,

Stuart

Louise,

Maybe you were able to get a 2001 bonus payment for Stuart Zisman and just can't tell me, but if not, I would appreciate anything and everything that you can do.  I know Stuart is very well respected outside of this company, and will leave if things become uncertain.  While I would hate to lose anyone on the team, I would especially hate to lose him.  

Good luck with things this weekend, and let me know if I can do anything (713-412-8967).

Thanks,

Don

Louise,

Quick follow-up on Allegheny, just in case you get a call today.  I have come to learn that Peter Skrgic is now the former President of Allegheny Energy Supply, having just retired in the last month.  He has been replaced by Mike Morrell, who is also the CFO, until someone can be found to replace him.  Morrell should be very familiar with Allegheny's financing plan for these assets. 

To the extent that you want to pass the detailed financing conversation on to me, I am more than happy to have that conversation with Morrell. Also, just so you know, apparently Goldman is going to be the lead banker on the equity offering.  

Let me know if you hear anything or have any questions.

Thanks,

Don

I just spoke with Matthew and he explained that the transaction tax reserve=
 calculation (a summary of which is attached) was prepared (and communicate=
d to the deal group) early last fall.  The calculation indicates that the a=
ggregate transaction tax exposure (including penalties) is $12,940,182.  Th=
e initial suggested tax reserve related to this exposure was approximately =
1/2 of this amount but, after discussions with Don last week, was increased=
 to 100 percent - thus the increase in tax reserve of approximately $6,000,=
000.  Thus, as evident, it is not that a calculation was incorrect but that=
 its assessment probability was increased and thus the suggested tax reserv=
e changed.  Matthew was influenced in increasing the applicable level of ri=
sk related to the transaction by a desire to more conservatively posture En=
ron after the completion of the disposition and to insure that subsequent p=
eriod "surprises" did not occur - obviously, to the extent that collective =
management is of the belief that such a conservative posture is not appropr=
iate then the tax reserve amount may be reduced.  Matthew spoke with Don be=
fore the change was proposed and was under the impression that all were com=
fortable with the change before it was made - ultimately, we will realize t=
he reserved amount in earnings as the risk of the tax planning strategies s=
ubsides.  Matthew will be back in the office on May 8 and ready to speak wi=
th whomever desires at that time.  I am attending the Enron Law Conference =
beginning this afternoon, followed by the Enron Industrial Markets Offsite =
next Monday and Tuesday but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-817-5052=

Wes, attached is the explanation for the Allegheny tax reserve.  I do not k=
now why it was increased when it was.  It was my understanding that the res=
erve had been quantified by Matt Gockerman in my group and requested some t=
ime ago and that Don and the commercial leads were aware of this.  This may=
 be coming across as an increase when in reality it is simply properly book=
ing currently that which was previously expected (said differently, without=
 the disposition we would have spread the tax over time and with the dispos=

Subject:=09RE: Tax reserve on Allegheny Peakers

The reserve referred to relates to Sales and Use tax ("Sales/Use tax") liab=
ility related to the purchase and use by the Peaker project companies of va=
rious equipment (i.e., turbines in Illinois and transformers in Tennessee a=
nd Indiana) used to construct the Peaker facilities in Illinois, Indiana an=
d Tennessee.  Enron bears this tax obligation under the Sales Agreement pur=
suant to which we sold the Peakers to Allegheny (effectively, this tax liab=
ility is a "pre-acquisition date" tax liability that we, as the seller, are=
 responsible for).  Typically, the equipment used to construct the Peakers =
would be assessed Sales/Use tax when purchased by the Project company that =
built the respective Peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to =
the buyer in a sale such as that to Allegheny.  The EWS Tax Department stru=
ctured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the Sale=
s/Use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time (for example, a sales=
-leaseback strategy was employed in Illinois to spread the cost of the Sale=
s/Use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up =
front).  Ultimately, we benefitted from this since we did not use as much c=
ash in constructing the Peakers and earned more from the disposition of the=
 Peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have (an=
d we believe did in the specific case of Allegheny) modelled the cost of th=
e Peakers as including the full current payment of such Sales/Use tax.  Tha=
t said, we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from t=
he sale of the Peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitati=
ons related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the ab=
ove described results expires since there is risk that our position could b=
e challenged and, if challenged, there is a risk that we would not prevail.=

The reserve referred to relates to Sales and Use tax ("Sales/Use tax") liab=
ility related to the purchase and use by the Peaker project companies of va=
rious equipment (i.e., turbines in Illinois and transformers in Tennessee a=
nd Indiana) used to construct the Peaker facilities in Illinois, Indiana an=
d Tennessee.  Enron bears this tax obligation under the Sales Agreement pur=
suant to which we sold the Peakers to Allegheny (effectively, this tax liab=
ility is a "pre-acquisition date" tax liability that we, as the seller, are=
 responsible for).  Typically, the equipment used to construct the Peakers =
would be assessed Sales/Use tax when purchased by the Project company that =
built the respective Peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to =
the buyer in a sale such as that to Allegheny.  The EWS Tax Department stru=
ctured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the Sale=
s/Use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time (for example, a sales=
-leaseback strategy was employed in Illinois to spread the cost of the Sale=
s/Use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up =
front).  Ultimately, we benefitted from this since we did not use as much c=
ash in constructing the Peakers and earned more from the disposition of the=
 Peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have (an=
d we believe did in the specific case of Allegheny) modelled the cost of th=
e Peakers as including the full current payment of such Sales/Use tax.  Tha=

It is not much different than Cinergy's or AES's releases when they purchased peakers.  Please forward all comments to me at your earliest convenience.  While I am out of the office, I am accessing e-mail and voice mail or you can page me at 877-576-8750.  Thanks.

Dave,

Quick update.

It appears Art is on vacation all week.  He is obviously not too concerned about the issue.  I am still waiting to hear back from David Tang to see if they want one of their guys to go to the plant tomorrow.  

We could/should get FERC approval any day.  This is the last real CP for this deal.

Let me know if you and Cyrus hook up.

Thanks,

Don

Hi Louise,

Hope all is going well! Please advise re: Asset Marketing plan. We've received buyoff from Don Miller for the attached plan. I believe that you had mentioned potentially assigning a margin target to him, and would appreciate your input on this. 

The expenses for the quarter currently appear on the management summary that we supply to you each Monday.

 If  you have any questions, please call me at x30352. Thanks!

Good Evening,

> Summary:
> 1. The Power Markets Are Regional In Nature   The fragmented US

> economic disparities.  In order to fully understand this industry, macro

> 2. Announced Projects Cannot Be Taken At Face Value   Out of the 285,487
> MW of project announcements we have identified, only 26% are actually
> under construction.  Our base case analysis suggests that only 53%
> (149,944 MW) of the announced projects will be completed.
> 3. Shortages Will Persist In Several Key Markets   Owing to a combination
> of current supply shortages, capacity retirements and demand growth, we
> estimate that the entire US will need 207,689 new MWs by 2006 in order to
> achieve an equilibrium 18% capacity margin.  This requirement is 39% above
> our base case buildout forecast.  Consequently, we project a 2006 capacity
> shortfall of 57,745 MW.  Our analysis indicates that supply shortages will
> be most pronounced in the Mid-Atlantic, New York, parts of the Midwest,
> and the Southeast.
> 4. Positive Implications For Generators   Our findings have positive
> implications for selected generators.  We believe that Calpine (CPN,
> Strong Buy), Entergy (ETR, Buy), Mirant (MIR, Buy), NRG Energy (NRG, Buy),
> PPL Corp. (PPL, Buy), and Reliant Resources (RRI, Buy) are best positioned

Louise:

I have given to your admin a copy of the Cogentrix CA and have bracketed the language that needs your approval.  Legal had originally told me that I needed Detmering and Donahue to sign off.  Detmering has told me that either you or Lavorato need to sign off.  Per my conversation with Donahue, he is o.k. because Kristina Mordaunt has signed off on the language.  

We have a little over a week to get a preliminary, non-binding bid in, if the original schedule holds, and we have held off as long as we can signing any language along these lines, but we are now starting to be backed against the wall.  This language represents the best we are going to be able to accomplish in this situation.

Charlie

I am pleased to announce that yesterday (May 3) we closed the sale of the Wheatland, Gleason and Lincoln peaker plants to Allegheny. The completion of this LONG transaction was truly a team effort!  We are currently planning a closing celebration, and I will follow up with the details.

Thanks again for everyone's contribution.

(Sorry for the day delay in the announcement but as you know Outlook was down yesterday)

Louise,

As I am sure you are aware, our current plans on Fort Pierce include going back to FPUA and being honest with them (i.e. letting them know that the transaction as currently structured is not likely to proceed).  The goal of our meeting with FPUA is to be both fair and honest and to provide them with the opportunity to make the project more feasible by making economic concessions.  One concern that I have heard is that FPUA may incorrectly assume that our visit has little to do with the reason mentioned above and more to do with Enron's recent troubles.  Because FPUA is a municipal entity and this project has been closely followed by the media, this discussion is likely to make it into the newspapers and any conclusions reached by FPUA may be announced for all the world to see.  Do you have any suggestions for how this situation should be handled?  Should Eric Thode be consulted?

Stuart

Louise,

Don and I spoke about this prior to the execution of the Highstar letter.  While we both feel that it is unlikely that we will be in "material negotiations" with a potential counterparty within the next 11 days (or so), we are prepared to notify AIG in the event that something comes very quickly.  Thanks.

Stuart

To all:

Attached below is the letter signed between ENA and Highstar.  In summary, we have acknowledged that we have been unable to finalize the existing transaction but are going to discuss a restructured deal.  ENA is free to begin marketing the plants to third parties, provided that we cannot enter into binding agreements before May 11, 2001.  Either party may terminate after May 11, 2001 for any reason or no reason.

Now on to final docs!

Regards,

Heather

Dave,

Quick update.

It appears Art is on vacation all week.  He is obviously not too concerned about the issue.  I am still waiting to hear back from David Tang to see if they want one of their guys to go to the plant tomorrow.  

We could/should get FERC approval any day.  This is the last real CP for this deal.

Let me know if you and Cyrus hook up.

Thanks,

Don

John,

Quick update on sale of NA to Duke.  Stuart got them up from $120MM to $135MM (should be close book value of asset at closing).  Waiting to see if they try to knock us for issues discovered during due dili including GE/Power Systems lawsuit.  Stuart is sitting down with them tomorrow to negotiate Purchase and Sale Agreement.  At best, could  be in a position to sign this up next week.  I assume we need to DASH this or do you want to handle some other way?

Regards,

Don

Subject:=09RE: FW: Tax reserve on Allegheny Peakers

I just spoke with Matthew and he explained that the transaction tax reserve=
 calculation (a summary of which is attached) was prepared (and communicate=
d to the deal group) early last fall.  The calculation indicates that the a=
ggregate transaction tax exposure (including penalties) is $12,940,182.  Th=
e initial suggested tax reserve related to this exposure was approximately =
1/2 of this amount but, after discussions with Don last week, was increased=
 to 100 percent - thus the increase in tax reserve of approximately $6,000,=
000.  Thus, as evident, it is not that a calculation was incorrect but that=
 its assessment probability was increased and thus the suggested tax reserv=
e changed.  Matthew was influenced in increasing the applicable level of ri=
sk related to the transaction by a desire to more conservatively posture En=
ron after the completion of the disposition and to insure that subsequent p=
eriod "surprises" did not occur - obviously, to the extent that collective =
management is of the belief that such a conservative posture is not appropr=
iate then the tax reserve amount may be reduced.  Matthew spoke with Don be=
fore the change was proposed and was under the impression that all were com=
fortable with the change before it was made - ultimately, we will realize t=
he reserved amount in earnings as the risk of the tax planning strategies s=
ubsides.  Matthew will be back in the office on May 8 and ready to speak wi=
th whomever desires at that time.  I am attending the Enron Law Conference =
beginning this afternoon, followed by the Enron Industrial Markets Offsite =
next Monday and Tuesday but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-817-5052=

Wes, attached is the explanation for the Allegheny tax reserve.  I do not k=
now why it was increased when it was.  It was my understanding that the res=
erve had been quantified by Matt Gockerman in my group and requested some t=
ime ago and that Don and the commercial leads were aware of this.  This may=
 be coming across as an increase when in reality it is simply properly book=
ing currently that which was previously expected (said differently, without=
 the disposition we would have spread the tax over time and with the dispos=

Subject:=09RE: Tax reserve on Allegheny Peakers

The reserve referred to relates to Sales and Use tax ("Sales/Use tax") liab=
ility related to the purchase and use by the Peaker project companies of va=
rious equipment (i.e., turbines in Illinois and transformers in Tennessee a=
nd Indiana) used to construct the Peaker facilities in Illinois, Indiana an=
d Tennessee.  Enron bears this tax obligation under the Sales Agreement pur=
suant to which we sold the Peakers to Allegheny (effectively, this tax liab=
ility is a "pre-acquisition date" tax liability that we, as the seller, are=
 responsible for).  Typically, the equipment used to construct the Peakers =
would be assessed Sales/Use tax when purchased by the Project company that =
built the respective Peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to =
the buyer in a sale such as that to Allegheny.  The EWS Tax Department stru=
ctured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the Sale=
s/Use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time (for example, a sales=
-leaseback strategy was employed in Illinois to spread the cost of the Sale=
s/Use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up =
front).  Ultimately, we benefitted from this since we did not use as much c=
ash in constructing the Peakers and earned more from the disposition of the=
 Peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have (an=
d we believe did in the specific case of Allegheny) modelled the cost of th=
e Peakers as including the full current payment of such Sales/Use tax.  Tha=
t said, we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from t=
he sale of the Peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitati=
ons related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the ab=
ove described results expires since there is risk that our position could b=
e challenged and, if challenged, there is a risk that we would not prevail.=
  Matt is out until May 8 (he is a recent father of a baby girl) but upon h=
is return is available with me to discuss this matter with whomever you wou=
ld like.  Matt has worked closely with Don and others in the Generation Ass=
et group and has assured me that the suggested reserve is a sound (not over=

Thanks for the note.  The concern was not over the timing of the receipt of funds but rather a comment which implied that Allegheny needed to raise the funds through an equity offering.  Is that a fair characterization and, if so, do you have any concerns over Allegheny's short term access to capital (i.e. what is their funding strategy if the equity markets continue to be rocky).  My concern is heightened by the bankruptcy filing of PCG which will most likely create a fair amount of volatility through the utility sector.

I appreciate your thoughts.

Thanks,

Ben

Ben,

I have heard through the grape vine that concerns were raised this morning at your staff meeting about the Allegheny closing.  Just to clarify, we have set May 3, 2001 as the closing date.  On that date we should receive $1,028,000.00 plus $10-15 million for reimbursement of some cost associated with a build out of a sub station. 

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Don

Wes, attached is the explanation for the Allegheny tax reserve.  I do not k=
now why it was increased when it was.  It was my understanding that the res=
erve had been quantified by Matt Gockerman in my group and requested some t=
ime ago and that Don and the commercial leads were aware of this.  This may=
 be coming across as an increase when in reality it is simply properly book=
ing currently that which was previously expected (said differently, without=
 the disposition we would have spread the tax over time and with the dispos=
ition it became necessary to accelerate it as reflected in the tax reserve)=
.  As always, I have asked that only the absolutely necessary amount be res=
erved.  Please call me at ext. 30938 to further discuss this matter.  Best =
regards.  Steve.

Dave,

We received a little inside information on Cinergy (no guarantee if reflective of corporate view, but insightful non the less).  The feedback indicates that holding firm in our "no run" stance is the best position to take at this time.

Apparently this "run/no run" issue is partly an internal political issue between Houston and Cincinnati, whereby the operators in Cincinnati think Tang and Vivar cut a bum deal on this remedial work issue which allowed these modifications (bearing and silencer at Brownsville, control curves at Caledonia) but did not require any testing.  It appears the guys in Cincinnati are posturing such that if the machines break or don't work as planned, the blame would then fall on Tang and Vivar (this helps explain why Tang is so adamant about running).  The view was that given this, ultimately the PSA rules and running is not required.   

Let me know if you need any more color.

Thanks for your help.

Don

I will be circulating in the next few minutes a revised New Albany Analysis.  The only revisions that were made were to correct: (1) the cost basis (as of 3/31/01), (2) the monthly depreciation amount (which actually diverges from the budgeted amount) and (3) the spare parts basis.  I have double checked with Cris Sherman and Theresa Vos and they are in agreement with these numbers.  The total impact of these changes is a reduction to the PV Margin of $2,316,000.  I apologize for the mistake but hope that you understand that the mistake arose from errors in the information that was supplied to me.  

Stuart

Louise,

Allegheny is no bid on New Albany.  They want to focus only on technology which allows for combine cycle conversion.  The turbines at New Albany do not accommodate combine cycle conversion.

They are interested in pursuing our Longview development in Washington, and we are going to follow up with them on a couple of sites in Entergy.

It looks like I might really have to work at selling New Albany!!!

Don

to be more aggressive today, we can push Matt for a smaller reserve.

Louise,

We are selling Vitro for an enterprise value (EV) of $208.4MM ($136MM in debt, $53MM in book equity, $15.5MM premium from Tractebel for 80%, and $3.9MM implied premium for our 20% stake).

EBITDA for 2003 (first full year of operation) is $24MM for an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.7X.

Using the average EBITDA for 14 years of $31MM you end up an EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.7X.

In my mind, both are great multiples for a project such as Vitro.  The nice fact is that we get $15.5MM from Tractebel with $10MM invested for our 20%, or a net negative $5 million investment in the project.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Don

Our research indicates that in 1998 Wisvest paid UI $272 million or approx. $245/kW for these two plants.  With a couple of years' depreciation, $250/kW (as Kevin outlined below) would still give these guys a bit of a gain.

Subject: Conn. Coal Plants



As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

 a product of collective judgment.  The Tax Department was influenced in in=

I just spoke with Matthew and he explained that the transaction tax reserve=
 calculation (a summary of which is attached) was prepared (and communicate=
d to the deal group) early last fall.  The calculation indicates that the a=
ggregate transaction tax exposure (including penalties) is $12,940,182.  Th=
e initial suggested tax reserve related to this exposure was approximately =
1/2 of this amount but, after discussions with Don last week, was increased=
 to 100 percent - thus the increase in tax reserve of approximately $6,000,=
000.  Thus, as evident, it is not that a calculation was incorrect but that=
 its assessment probability was increased and thus the suggested tax reserv=
e changed.  Matthew was influenced in increasing the applicable level of ri=
sk related to the transaction by a desire to more conservatively posture En=
ron after the completion of the disposition and to insure that subsequent p=
eriod "surprises" did not occur - obviously, to the extent that collective =
management is of the belief that such a conservative posture is not appropr=
iate then the tax reserve amount may be reduced.  Matthew spoke with Don be=
fore the change was proposed and was under the impression that all were com=
fortable with the change before it was made - ultimately, we will realize t=

ubsides.  Matthew will be back in the office on May 8 and ready to speak wi=

The reserve referred to relates to Sales and Use tax ("Sales/Use tax") liab=
ility related to the purchase and use by the Peaker project companies of va=
rious equipment (i.e., turbines in Illinois and transformers in Tennessee a=
nd Indiana) used to construct the Peaker facilities in Illinois, Indiana an=
d Tennessee.  Enron bears this tax obligation under the Sales Agreement pur=
suant to which we sold the Peakers to Allegheny (effectively, this tax liab=
ility is a "pre-acquisition date" tax liability that we, as the seller, are=
 responsible for).  Typically, the equipment used to construct the Peakers =
would be assessed Sales/Use tax when purchased by the Project company that =
built the respective Peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to =
the buyer in a sale such as that to Allegheny.  The EWS Tax Department stru=
ctured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the Sale=
s/Use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time (for example, a sales=
-leaseback strategy was employed in Illinois to spread the cost of the Sale=
s/Use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up =
front).  Ultimately, we benefitted from this since we did not use as much c=

 Peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have (an=
d we believe did in the specific case of Allegheny) modelled the cost of th=

ove described results expires since there is risk that our position could b=

This email is intended to serve as an update to the closing schedule for the sale to Tractebel of an 80% interest in Enron's Monterrey Project. 

The closing schedule is as follows:

Wednesday, October 17, 2001 - Preclosing (getting all the documents required for closing in order).
Thursday, October 18, 2001 - Finalize Preclosing
Friday, October 19, 2001 - Money changes hands, and we transfer 80% of our interest to Tractebel.

As such, unless otherwise notified, please assume that as of Friday, October 17, our ownership in the Monterrey Project will drop to 20%.  There will be a transition period with Tractebel following closing.  If you are unsure how this sale will impact your daily routine as it relates to this project, please contact either Steve Irvin or me.  

Important Reminder

We last met on September 21, 2001 to go through the reps, warranties and covenants (and related schedules) that Enron is providing at closing.  If anyone is aware of any update or change that should be made to those schedules such that all our reps, warranties and covenants are all still true and correct in all material respects, please let me know immediately.  A copy of the reps, key covenants, and schedules is provided below.  Please review and let me know of any changes today.

Thanks again for everyone's help over the past five months as we have pushed this transaction towards closure. It has truly been a team effort.

My understanding from legal was that Corporate Development as represented by Donahue and the business unit had to sign off.  He brought Mordaunt into the picture for his legal side.  I don't like going outside of EA anymore than you do, but according to established policy relayed to me through legal stand still and non-solicitation language requires this type of sign off.

Detmering has told me that either you or Lavorato need to sign off.  Per my conversation with Donahue, he is o.k. because Kristina Mordaunt has signed off on the language.  

We have a little over a week to get a preliminary, non-binding bid in, if the original schedule holds, and we have held off as long as we can signing any language along these lines, but we are now starting to be backed against the wall.

Thanks for the note.  The concern was not over the timing of the receipt of funds but rather a comment which implied that Allegheny needed to raise the funds through an equity offering.  Is that a fair characterization and, if so, do you have any concerns over Allegheny's short term access to capital (i.e. what is their funding strategy if the equity markets continue to be rocky).  My concern is heightened by the bankruptcy filing of PCG which will most likely create a fair amount of volatility through the utility sector.

I appreciate your thoughts.

Ben,

I have heard through the grape vine that concerns were raised this morning at your staff meeting about the Allegheny closing.  Just to clarify, we have set May 3, 2001 as the closing date.  On that date we should receive $1,028,000.00 plus $10-15 million for reimbursement of some cost associated with a build out of a sub station. 

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Louise,

Allegheny is no bid on New Albany.  They want to focus only on technology which allows for combine cycle conversion.  The turbines at New Albany do not accommodate combine cycle conversion.

They are interested in pursuing our Longview development in Washington, and we are going to follow up with them on a couple of sites in Entergy.

It looks like I might really have to work at selling New Albany!!!

Louise,

I spun things around a bit, but honestly I am comfortable with either version.  Should this go to Detmering as well?

Louise,

Allegheny is no bid on New Albany.  They want to focus only on technology which allows for combine cycle conversion.  The turbines at New Albany do not accommodate combine cycle conversion.

They are interested in pursuing our Longview development in Washington, and we are going to follow up with them on a couple of sites in Entergy.

It looks like I might really have to work at selling New Albany!!!

Don

The transaction for the sale of the New Albany Peaker Plant just closed.  Paul Garcia of Enron treasury confirmed that we received the wire transfer of the purchase proceeds from Duke. 

I would like to personally thank everyone that was involved in the sales process.  This transaction went very smoothly and I received several compliments from our counterparty regarding our professionalism on this deal.

Please take all post-closing actions that are required to finally consummate the conveyance and also be aware that the Purchase and Sale Agreement requires us to keep any and all data or information regarding the project and the transaction confidential for a period of two years.  In order to comply with the foregoing provision, I would strongly suggest that conversations regarding this transaction be limited to only those Enron employees who have a "need to know."

Thanks

Stuart

Pat,

On Thursday, May 3rd, Enron will receive two wire transfers from Supply.
They will be in the amount of $600,000,000 and $447,700,445. The wires will
be coming from PNC Bank, Allegheny Energy Supply Company account number
1008969371.  I believe someone in Enron's Treasury department was looking
for this information.  Please let me know if you need any further additional
information.

John,

The DASH is in progress.  Stuart had a great meeting with Duke on Friday and it appears that there is a deal to be had.  Looks like we could possibly sign by Friday.  Stuart wants to meet with you and Presto on Monday (he has a call into Kim to set a time).

Subject:	Pacific Gas and Electric Company Files for Chapter 11 Reorganization


    SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 6, 2001--Pacific Gas and
Electric Company, the utility unit of PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG),
today filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code in San Francisco bankruptcy court. The company said it is taking
this action in light of its unreimbursed energy costs which are now
increasing by more than $300 million per month, continuing CPUC
decisions that economically disadvantage the company, and the now
unmistakable fact that negotiations with Governor Gray Davis and his
representatives are going nowhere.
    Neither PG&E Corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries,
including its National Energy Group, have filed for Chapter 11
reorganization or are affected by the utility's filing.
    "We chose to file for Chapter 11 reorganization affirmatively
because we expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a
solution, which thus far the State and the State's regulators have
been unable to achieve," said Robert D. Glynn, Jr., Chairman of
Pacific Gas and Electric Company. "The regulatory and political
processes have failed us, and now we are turning to the court."
    Glynn added, "Our objective is to move through the Chapter 11
reorganization process as quickly as possible, without disruption to
our operations or inconvenience to our customers. Throughout this
crisis, our 20,000 employees have been and remain committed to
providing safe and reliable service to the 13 million Californians who
depend on us to deliver their gas and electricity."
    Pacific Gas and Electric Company decided to file for the
protection of Chapter 11 primarily due to:

    --  Failure by the state to assume the full procurement
        responsibility for Pacific Gas and Electric's "net open
        position" as was provided under AB1X. This has the result of
        increasing financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy
        procurement costs, which the utility estimates to be
        approximately $300 million or more per month.

    --  The impact of actions by the California Public Utilities
        Commission (CPUC) on March 27, 2001, and April 3, 2001, that
        created new payment obligations for the company and undermined
        its ability to return to financial viability.

    --  Lack of progress in negotiations with the state to provide
        recovery of $9 billion in wholesale power purchases made by
        the utility since June 2000, which have not been recoverable
        in frozen rates.

    --  The adoption by the CPUC of an illegal and retroactive
        accounting change that would appear to eliminate our true
        uncollected wholesale costs.

    "In addition, despite Pacific Gas & Electric's best efforts to
work with the State of California to reach a consensual, responsible,
fair and comprehensive solution to California's energy crisis, no
agreement has been reached with the Governor and the Governor's
representatives have dramatically slowed the pace and the progress of
discussions over the past month.
    "Furthermore since last fall, we have filed comprehensive plans
for resolving this matter with the CPUC, but they have not acted
affirmatively on them," said Glynn.
    On October 4, 2000, Pacific Gas and Electric sought emergency rate
action by the CPUC. In November 2000, we filed our rate stabilization
plan, which, if adopted, would have increased electric prices by an
initial 25 percent, compared with the 46 percent recently adopted by
the CPUC. Neither request was acted upon. Had the state acted at that
time:

    --  Pacific Gas and Electric would have been kept creditworthy;



    --  Pacific Gas and Electric would have been able to enter into
        long-term power purchase contracts at prices lower than those
        announced by the state;

    --  The state would not have had to almost exhaust the state's
        budget surplus by spending billions of dollars to purchase
        power for the utility's customers;

    --  The state would not now need to issue billions of dollars in
        bonds to cover these power purchases; and

    --  The state would not now be advancing a proposal to spend
        billions of dollars to purchase the state's three
        investor-owned utility's electric transmission systems.

    "This year, the state has spent more than $3 billion on power
purchases and, with the CPUC, has arranged to be reimbursed for these
expenses," noted Glynn. "In contrast, since June Pacific Gas and
Electric Company has spent $9 billion in excess of revenues to pay for
power for its customers and exhausted its ability to continue
borrowing, but there has been no progress on a plan to reimburse it
for those expenditures as provided by law.
    "Statements by the Governor and other public officials since last
September gave us reason to believe that a solution could be reached
outside the context of Chapter 11 that would restore the utility's
financial viability and enable it to meet its financial obligations
equitably. However, these statements have not been followed up by
constructive actions, and a reorganization in Chapter 11 is now the
most feasible means of resolution."
    The utility will utilize existing resources to continue operating
its business during bankruptcy, including paying vendors and suppliers
in full for goods and services received after the filing. The utility
will pay electric commodity suppliers as provided by law. The utility
intends to continue normal electric and gas transmission and
distribution functions during the Chapter 11 process. Employees will
continue to be paid. Health care plans and other benefits for
employees and most retirees will continue. The utility's qualified
retirement plans for retirees and vested employees are fully funded
and protected by federal law.
