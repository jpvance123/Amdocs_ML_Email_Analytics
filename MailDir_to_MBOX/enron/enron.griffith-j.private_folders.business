Hi,

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
	
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

Enron debt sinks on credit crunch fears


By Nancy Leinfuss 

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Bonds of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>), which is trying to curb fears that it faces a credit crunch, fell sharply on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported the energy giant on Thursday drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and is in talks with its banks about obtaining a new multibillion dollar credit line.

	

Houston-based Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said late on Thursday that the company, the largest U.S. energy trader with $67.3 billion of assets, had drawn down from its credit lines to obtain more than $1 billion in cash to alleviate concerns about its liquidity. 

``There's been a lot of downward pressure on Enron following the negative news,'' said an investment-grade bond trader. ``Investment-grade accounts have been trying to exit those bonds, but there hasn't been any support from either high-yield or hedge funds.'' 

Enron did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 

Enron's investment-grade 6.40 percent notes due in 2006, which just two weeks ago were quoted to yield 2.3 percentage points more than five-year U.S. Treasuries, are now quoted at a dollar price, like junk bonds. They were bid Friday at 80 cents on the dollar, with a yield to maturity of 12.09 percent, or 8.34 percentage points more than Treasuries. 

Enron's 8.31 percent issue due 2003 fell a similar amount on Friday, and also trades at 80 cents on the dollar, traders said. 

The company's stock, meanwhile, has lost more than half of its value in the last two weeks as investors began questioning off-the-balance-sheet transactions between the company and two limited partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking at those transactions for possible conflicts of interest. 

Enron ousted Fastow on Wednesday. 

The shares were down $1.09, or 6.7 percent, at $15.26 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. 

CREDIT RATINGS AT RISK 

On Thursday, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's revised Enron's outlook to negative while affirming its long- and short-term credit ratings of ``BBB-plus'' and ``A-2.'' 

S&P said it is closely monitoring Enron's capital needs and liquidity position, which it considers crucial to the success of the company's core business operations. 

``Assurances from the top levels of Enron management that the company will maintain its commitment to its credit quality and that no steps are being taken to support the company's common stock price at the expense of credit quality provide further support for Enron's ratings,'' S&P said. 

S&P said it revised its outlook after the big drop in Enron's market capitalization this week, which it said has hurt the company's financial flexibility and may impede management's ability to rebuild the balance sheet and sell assets in a timely manner. 

``The negative outlook acknowledges the potential for erosion of the company's credit quality as investor confidence in the company's management has waned,'' S&P said. 

Another credit rating agency, Fitch, on Thursday warned it may downgrade Enron's debt, saying the erosion of consumer confidence could block the company's access to capital markets.

?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

I grew up in Lahore which is about 100-150 miles from Islamabad(the capital)- My parents are still settled there. Its not as advanced at most of the big cities here but it is pretty. Parts of Pakistan - in the north are actually a hikers paradise. Very green, very pretty and not very commercial- not like the more dry rugged areas in Afghanistan. The country on the whole has a very low literacy rate and that is the root cause for a lot of problems that we are currently seeing. There are a lot of Europeans/mainly English who are settled in Pakistan for years and infect my mother/aunt and most of my family have studied in Catholic schools. That side of the story often goes untold.   
Eventhough a lot of people oppose the U.S led attacks you would be surprised at how many people in Pakistan support the attacks on Afghanistan. Those who oppose ar ejust more militant and vocal but not the majority by any means.  Most are just afraid of their security. Also they feel that they are already so poor that they cannot afford to go to war. But i think if this goes well it would be really good for the country.
As for American foreign policy. I think its has a lot of short term focus and can improve but then again it is always easy to criticize somebody on the top. The good things achieved by Americans is often conviniently forgotten.

so it looks like if Pakistan supports the US, the US better be ready to help out in the future.  It is like the US is supporting whoever they think will help them best at that time.  Not that I am supporting the US but that is probably what most countries do anyway, right?

anyway i hope your family is okay and that everything will work out for the best, none of us want people like the terrorist running around the world free, whether they be middle eastern, american, israeli whatever.

by the way what city does your parents live in?  did you grow up there?  is it a nice city?  sorry for the questions.  I am just interested in other cultures.

John-
Thanks for asking- i am glad you try to get more information before forming opinions. I have also posted an article of the fundy website due to requests by Hunter which you might find informative.

The anti-west opinion is definitely a minority opinion. However, as we have seen in the past even in U.S minorities like KKK, terrorists, mass murderers, religious fanatics pose the biggest threat and try to get the most publicity and unfortunately they are succeeding for right now.  I think the educated population felt betrayed by the west in fighting fundamentalism uptil now but they support this move. But you have to understand that most of the big cities in Pakistan are within the range of the Taliban Scud missiles. Thats why support is a very relative term here.

The general does not have any political mandate- he came into power through a military coup. However, the previously democratically elected governments were notorious for corruption(including the government of Benazir Bhutto- the first women head of state of Pakistan who was educated in Harvard and Oxford). So people by default support any other alternative and military is probably the ony institution that is relatively untouched by corruption. Most of the cabinet and ministers right now are liberals and among them are some that gave up extremely lucrative jobs in U.S in order to try to help put the country back on track economically.

Let me send you an article from the TIME mag. that kind of explains why the President of Pakistan is in a fix. 
http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,175058,00.html


Also below is part of an article from a Pakistani newspaper explaining how the President met with all the political and religious parties and explained to them why he supports the U.S - In the article the PPP and PML are the two major parties in Pakistan. Just like the Democrats and Republicans here... and the Jamati-i-Islami and the other parties are the religous parties.
He apprised the political leaders that the US administration had demanded concrete actions as a proof of friendship. 

The measures that Washington wanted Islamabad to take included allowing American troops to use Naval facilities and airspace and sharing of all intelligence reports about Osama bin Laden's movement inside Afghanistan. Otherwise, the president told the politicians, Washington had warned that it would treat Pakistan as a country harbouring terrorists. 

In that case, the president said, no strategic installations would have remained safe. "I could not take that risk," the source quoted President Musharraf as having said. The president said that he could risk his life but he could not put the whole country at risk. 

The US authorities had also conveyed to President Musharraf that they had the technological capability to smoke out the Taliban or Osama out of their holes. This was interpreted by the politicians as a threat to use chemical or biological weapons in Afghanistan. 

Having received these explanations, main stream political parties, including the PPP and the PML (like-minded), backed the president's decision and said the country should rally round the government, the source said. 

However, Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (both Maulana Sami and Maulana Fazl groups) opposed the decision and asked the government to review its policy. They insisted that the government should demand for a credible evidence of Osama's involvement in the Sept 11 attacks on the US soil. 

Hope this helps you understand the cuurent situation without confusing you too much....
Bilal

Hey Bilal,

How are you doing?  I just wanted to ask you some questions about Pakistan if you don't mind.  I see some articles about protestors in Pakistan, protesting the US.  I can understand that, however, do you think this is the mijority opinion of Pakistan people, or are these protests happening in areas that are predominately backing the Taliban.  What do the educated population think?  Does the general have any backing from the people themselves?  

What is your opinion?

I understand that these things are very personal to you.  Please let me know if I am prying.  I just wanted to get someone's opinion that actually knows what is going on and not from the news.

Thanks.

John

John-
Thanks for asking- i am glad you try to get more information before forming opinions. I have also posted an article of the fundy website due to requests by Hunter which you might find informative.

The anti-west opinion is definitely a minority opinion. However, as we have seen in the past even in U.S minorities like KKK, terrorists, mass murderers, religious fanatics pose the biggest threat and try to get the most publicity and unfortunately they are succeeding for right now.  I think the educated population felt betrayed by the west in fighting fundamentalism uptil now but they support this move. But you have to understand that most of the big cities in Pakistan are within the range of the Taliban Scud missiles. Thats why support is a very relative term here.

The general does not have any political mandate- he came into power through a military coup. However, the previously democratically elected governments were notorious for corruption(including the government of Benazir Bhutto- the first women head of state of Pakistan who was educated in Harvard and Oxford). So people by default support any other alternative and military is probably the ony institution that is relatively untouched by corruption. Most of the cabinet and ministers right now are liberals and among them are some that gave up extremely lucrative jobs in U.S in order to try to help put the country back on track economically.

Let me send you an article from the TIME mag. that kind of explains why the President of Pakistan is in a fix. 
http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,175058,00.html


Also below is part of an article from a Pakistani newspaper explaining how the President met with all the political and religious parties and explained to them why he supports the U.S - In the article the PPP and PML are the two major parties in Pakistan. Just like the Democrats and Republicans here... and the Jamati-i-Islami and the other parties are the religous parties.
He apprised the political leaders that the US administration had demanded concrete actions as a proof of friendship. 

The measures that Washington wanted Islamabad to take included allowing American troops to use Naval facilities and airspace and sharing of all intelligence reports about Osama bin Laden's movement inside Afghanistan. Otherwise, the president told the politicians, Washington had warned that it would treat Pakistan as a country harbouring terrorists. 

In that case, the president said, no strategic installations would have remained safe. "I could not take that risk," the source quoted President Musharraf as having said. The president said that he could risk his life but he could not put the whole country at risk. 

The US authorities had also conveyed to President Musharraf that they had the technological capability to smoke out the Taliban or Osama out of their holes. This was interpreted by the politicians as a threat to use chemical or biological weapons in Afghanistan. 

Having received these explanations, main stream political parties, including the PPP and the PML (like-minded), backed the president's decision and said the country should rally round the government, the source said. 

However, Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (both Maulana Sami and Maulana Fazl groups) opposed the decision and asked the government to review its policy. They insisted that the government should demand for a credible evidence of Osama's involvement in the Sept 11 attacks on the US soil. 

Hope this helps you understand the cuurent situation without confusing you too much....
Bilal

Hey Bilal,

How are you doing?  I just wanted to ask you some questions about Pakistan if you don't mind.  I see some articles about protestors in Pakistan, protesting the US.  I can understand that, however, do you think this is the mijority opinion of Pakistan people, or are these protests happening in areas that are predominately backing the Taliban.  What do the educated population think?  Does the general have any backing from the people themselves?  

What is your opinion?

I understand that these things are very personal to you.  Please let me know if I am prying.  I just wanted to get someone's opinion that actually knows what is going on and not from the news.

Thanks.

John

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

One of my GARP connections at El Paso has put forth a white paper for 
discussion. He is hoping it will be adopted across the industry.  He will be 
presenting it June 5th, at the next GARP meeting in Houston, to be hosted by 
El Paso at El Paso.  He is collecting feedback before the upcoming meeting.  
Please review, and comment to either myself of Lloyd at the address below.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=
n=20
America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=
=20
target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose o=
f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=
,=20
with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20
allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=
ar=20
will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20
Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=
=01,s=20
sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20
organization.=20

John,
 
I found the error.  It was a small logic error.
 
You can easily fix the problem if you go into the visual basic editor for the blotter file.  In the editor, you will see several modules listed on the left of the screen under the file.  You will need to edit the "Main_Query" module.
 
Once in the "Main_Query" module, you will need to search for the routine named "VerifyManualInputs".  The actual start of the routine looks like this:
 
Function VerifyManualInputs(FromDate As String, ToDate As String, PutCall As String, Lots As String, Strike As String, Price As String, CParty As String, sType As String) As Boolean

 
Within this routine, about 15-20 lines down, you should see the following two lines :
 
  If (isdate(FromDate) And isdate(ToDate)) Then
    If (ToDate < FromDate) Then
 
You need to change the second line to :
    
    If (CDate(ToDate) < CDate(FromDate)) Then
 
This should fix the problem.  The intent of the line is to prevent the "To Date" of a deal from being earlier than the "From Date".  In the original line of code, it does a TEXT based compare (like comparing is "ABC" < "DEF") instead of comparing the two values as DATES.  The modification I've laid out converts the from and to dates to date values before comparing.
 
I have tested the fix here and it should work fine.
 
I hope everything runs smooth for you next week.
 
Have a good Thanksgiving.
 
Greg

The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.

Stack Manager Modifications

Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. 

	 

Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.

Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "Fill order". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.

Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.

No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down". 

Changes regarding Suspension of products

Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:

?	Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose "Keep Awake" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?	Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached. This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section. 
?	Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

Subject: Harassment Avoidance Seminar

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful

potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you

**Clarification**

Harassment Prevention Training

This training is mandatory for all Enron employees employed since the last 
seminar was conducted  in late 1998 or early 1999.  Those who have already 
attended Enron harassment avoidance training will be offered a refresher 
course in avoiding and preventing harassment.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training.  

The dates and times available for the sessions are:


 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15
  Monday Mar 5; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00

All training sessions will be held in the LaSalle Room at the DoubleTree 
Hotel.
There is a $50 charge for each attendee in the training session.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

On Saturday, January 13, 2001, an earthquake shook Central America.  The 
earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.6, was centered off of El Salvador's

estimated at nearly $1 billion, nearly half of the country's annual budget.  

Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take 
advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your 
donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make, 
up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of

Harassment Avoidance FAQ

What do I do if I've already taken the class?
If you've already attended a session in the past while employed with Enron, 
you do not have to attend these sessions.  A "Refresher Course" will be 
offered at no cost.  

How do those of us attend the Harassment Avoidance if I do not work in 
Houston?
We are making the Harassment Avoidance sessions available on Video to be 
forwarded to your HR manager.   You are NOT encouraged to make travel 
arrangements to attend the Houston sessions.

Who pays the $50?
The $50 fee will be billed to your cost center. Individuals are not expected 
to pay.

Are there any additional dates than those listed on previous email?
Due to the number of people who have not attended in the past, we are making 
special arrangements to offer more classes in the next few months. 

It is important to note, that unless you've recieved a confirmation, you are 
not enrolled.  

All remaining questions or concerns need to be directed to David Foster 
(x.54360) or by email (david.foster@enron.com).
