Great.  How about noon in the lobby (of the old Enron Bldg)?  I'd love to
look at samples/pics, but maybe over the weekend.

   OK. let me know what time works and we'll meet.  I also have ( I need to
   look for it) a whole bunch of magazine cutouts that I had gathered
   earlier
   when you first bought your house to show you.  These are just examples
   of
   possible styles, tables, accessories etc. that you might like and that I
   can
   help you find to place in your house.  We can go over these as well if
   you
   want. I also have books I can lend you for you to look through and let
   me
   know if you like something.

      I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a
   ribbed
      off
      white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
      Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
      Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
      I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing your
      house
      ( I hear it's empty).
      If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I can
      meet
      you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so that
   I
      can
      stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.
   Fabric
      can
      be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
      I think 2 day is plenty of time.

      50% now - (not including taxes)
      50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery
   (6-8
      wks.).

      Need now
      $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
      I will give you a receipt.
      Let me know when you can see the fabric........

         Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
         Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
         I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one
      you
         need
         at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the
   furniture
         stores
         only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks
   if
         they
         are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday
      during
         lunch
         and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to
      order
         the
         fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.
      Also,
         I'll
         find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and
   then
         the
         other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.
      Checks
         payable to me and I pay with my company check.
         I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
         Sound good?

            Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

            You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about
   a
         30-35%

      go

         I

      I'll

Dear Jeff-
I have been in Atlanta for two weeks and am continuing to unpack and
assemble furniture. I thought of you last night as I came across the
wonderful surrealism book that you gave me; what a great book. Of
course, I had to stop my unpacking to read through parts of it. I did
not get much unapcking done, but I had fun.
I reconnected with Christina Johns, one of my roomates at Penn with
Dori and she passed along Dori's email address. I sent her an email
and she responded, and appears to be happy in Philly with her 18
month old daughter. I told her that we had seen each other in NYC
during the past years and gave her an update on your successes and
accomplishments.
I hope that work is going well. I have to return to an orientation
session. My new phone number (404)248-2290 and address 757 Houston
Mill Rd. NE, Apt. 8 Atlanta, GA. 30329-4240. Does Enron have an
office in Atlanta?
Best,
andi

Jeff,
 
If you could loan me the $5000, I can have that paid back to you by the first of November.  I have someone who wants the 5 acres but will not close on his house until the end of October.  I hope you will consider.  This would be the first time for me to ever own a home.  I don't have any other way of making this happen.
 
I want let you down.  This is a once in a lifetime deal for me.  I have so much to gain by this.  If I ever had to sell the house, it is worth $145,000.
 
Thanks,
 
Donnis

long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

Dear Jeff: 
Here's a copy of the letter I received from Italy. I will keep trying for you. 
Peter 
Hallo Peter, 
We are all glad you are doing well. The latest news shocked all Europe too, and thinghs are changed here as well. Today Mr. George Bush senior is here in Milano, and the city is on siege. There are the fashion shows on right now, but everybody is really laying low... 
 But eventually, and hopefully, things will settle, and (hopefully) business will be as usual again. 
Your Mies chair was quite a lucky find! Giovanni and I were looking for a similar chair for a while, but came out empty handed. All the other Design dealers we know have'nt seen one for a while... but we'll keep looking. 
We were also planning a visit to the NY Modernism show at the beginning of November. We thought they were going to cancel the event.... but they said "business as usual"! 
And we were happy to hear this. So we will be in the USA for a while, and a trip to Houston could be part of it.

   Veteran Was Behind Wheel in Lake Crash

    A part from an airplane that crashed in the Great Salt Lake on Sunday.
                       (Danny La/ The Salt Lake Tribune)

    BY NESREEN KHASHAN
    THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE

        GREAT SALT LAKE -- Tooele Valley Airport weekend manager Gary Parks
    heard the steady buzz of the KingAir Beech overhead.
        It was 5:20 p.m. on Sunday when he recognized the unmistakable
    sound of the twin-engine aircraft flying over the Great Salt Lake,
    minutes before it spiraled into the icy waters below, killing all nine
    people on board.
        When the plane went down, snow was driving down hard, and there was
    about a quarter-mile visibility around Tooele Valley, Parks said. While
    he wondered if the plane might land at a different airport, having
    unshakable confidence in John Cashman, the plane's veteran pilot, he
    didn't think the worst.
        "No, I didn't have a bad feeling," Parks said. "He was the best,
    most competent pilot I'd ever seen in my life."
        Today, federal investigators, including an official from the
    National Transportation Safety Board, are expected to begin examining
    the conditions that led to the crash. A barge hauling a crane is
    scheduled to arrive around noon to recover the shattered remains of the
    plane, which rests in about 5 feet of water 11 miles west and one mile
    north of the Salt Lake Marina.
        Preliminary reports indicate that the plane was flying under visual
    flight regulations, or VFR, which require that minimum visibility and
    weather standards be met, said Federal Aviation Administration
    spokesman Michael Fergus from Seattle. But federal investigators said
    there are no indications yet whether adverse weather played a role in
    the crash. Investigators still don't know if the pilot used or switched
    to flight instruments to navigate, which are most commonly used to
    compensate for poor visibility.
        The plane carrying Cashman and eight skydivers was returning from a
    weekend of jumping in Mesquite, Nev. Two of the skydivers, husband and
    wife, were the owners of Skydive Salt Lake, a Tooele-based company.
    Keith Stewart, the company's only other full-time employee, said the
    plane was used to make up to 23 jumps in Nevada from Friday through
    Sunday.
        Parks said he attempted to make radio contact with the plane
    immediately after he heard its engines. Investigators said Cashman
    never signaled for help, and Parks' efforts to reach the pilot were
    fruitless, he said.
        About five minutes later, the husband of one of the plane's
    passengers arrived at the airport to pick up his wife. Parks said at
    around 3:15 p.m. the man's wife had called her husband to say she was
    boarding.
        The 35-year-old plane didn't have a registered flight plan with the
    FAA. That meant airport officials didn't know it was in the air when
    Parks began calling around to see if the plane had landed at an
    alternate location. So when airport officials began searching for the
    aircraft about two hours after it disappeared, they examined several
    hours of radar reports to determine the plane's location, said Tooele
    County sheriff's Deputy Lt. Frank Park.
        Search-and-rescue officials believe that the four women and five
    men died instantly as the plane hit the water, fragmenting into pieces.

        Flying in from the southwest, the plane was probably making a
    180-degree turn into the Tooele airport runway when it went down,
    airport officials say.
        The first body was found at 1:30 a.m. Monday by the shores of the
    marina. During the next several hours, all nine bodies were recovered.
    Seven of the bodies were also found on the shore.
        Through the rest of Monday morning, a crew of at least three dozen
    on three boats concentrated on recovering personal effects from the
    plane.
        Brian Hall, one of the rescue workers who scoured the waters with
    flashlights that pierced the darkness, said the hardest part was "not
    knowing what you were going to find until you got there."
        Recovery crews retrieved foam pads, helmets, parachutes and other
    skydiving equipment.
        Parks said he was struck more than once by the commonplace items --
    like a single shoe floating in the water -- that were meticulously
    plucked from the scene. Most backpacks, duffle bags and other luggage
    that were floating were still zipped shut, but Parks recalled one large
    blue suitcase that had burst open, scattering articles of clothing over
    the water.
        "I've been doing this for a lot of years and it never gets easy,"
    Parks commented. "Unfortunately, any time you're involved with any
    tragedy like this, there will always be reminders of its personal
    nature."
        Monday's crash comes exactly five years after a small plane crash
    in Idaho in which six Utah businessmen and two pilots were killed.

Randy- Emilio and I had a vigorous debate today over the content and 
conclusions of the CABC Group's analysis of the questions you asked about the 
political and regulatory situation in Venezuela.  He expressed a number of 
areas of concern, some pertaining to the tone of the paper and others to its 
accuracy.

I acknowledged his concerns and promised to do my best to improve the tone 
and clarify any inaccuracies.  We will revisit with our sources to clarify 
the following issues:

1. Will the new Hydrocarbons Law just address liquid hydrocarbons or will it 
address gas hydrocarbons?  What details are available on the proposed law?
2. If the new law does affect gas, will it in effect overturn the 1999 Gas 
Law?
3.  Will gas tariffs be separate for transportation, distribution, and 
upstream, or will there be a single unified tariff?  Is there a dispute 
between PDVSA and the  Ministry of Mines and Energy on how this should be 
handled?
4. What is the current royalty and tax structure on gas?  Will it be affected 
by the new HydroCarbons Law?
5. What are the current renegotiation dynamics of the Cristobal Colon project 
between the government and foreign operators?

Once we have revisited with sources, I told Emilio that we will be happy to 
correct any subsequent errors.  However, if we reconfirm the information in 
the paper then perhaps the three of us can confer on how to proceed.

This has been a difficult assignment because we are essentially dealing with 
areas that are subject to interpretation and forecasting.  Emilio and I 
disagreed in some areas about the Chavez agenda, while agreeing in others.  
Also, because the HydroCarbons Law has not yet been written, we can only go 
on what sources in country are saying.  Clearly, we have conflicting 
information and will work to clear up the contradictions ASAP.

I suggest we postpone our Thursday meeting until both Emilio and I have time 
to conduct further follow-ups.  As I have said to both you and Emilio, the 
CABC role here is not to take any position on the merits of the deal, but 
rather to answer the specific concerns brought up by RAC.  Hopefully, these 
next steps will resolve the situation in mutually satisfying manner.

As we continue with the India LNG issues, and grow the fundamentals research 
capabilities, I need a "map of the world" showing all LNG producers, and the 
specs of the product they produce, and all of the receiving terminals (demand 
side) in the world that match up with those specs of the producers.  (In a 
nutshell, what can go where)  Can I get this ASAP?  

Thanks

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.
Nat

Jeff:

Attached you will find three files:

1) The brief description of the Envera deal you requested. ("deal summary 
final")
2) A diagram showing one potential view of how the e-Marketplace for 
Chemicals will look and where Enron would fit in. ("deal summary e-commerce 
marketplace")
3) A slide from Envera displaying their connectivity concept.  Enron will 
participate as a Member, a Service Provider and an Owner. ("basic envera 
concept")

Deals obviously are never done till they're done, but this one is 95+ % 
there.  We've received Envera Board Approval and signatures from 1/3 of the 
Owners' granting consent to issue equity to Enron.


Thanks to both you and John for your support.  We could not have come this 
far without it.





Doug

Subject: Offshore crude

Tom Byargeon, Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in 
the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana/Texas oil and gas drilling 
projects. This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure 
long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas 
trading desk activities. Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP 
program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than 
natural gas projects. 

They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which 
involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 
and #582. The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million 
barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd 
starting in 1Q 2003. Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 
API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur. Plans are to build a private pipeline to 
Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore. Peggy is 
finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore.

Tom's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude 
on either a fixed or floating basis. The floating could be tied to a Platt's 
index or the NYMEX. It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a 
physical or financial contract, but Tom hopes to get us first and/or last 
look from Murphy when the time is right. Another alternative is to give 
Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for 
the new production barrels. 

Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis 
differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003?

First I want to say Thank You Very Much.  Can you leave the check downstairs at the security desk?
 
I will have all of the money in November.
 
Thanks for everything.

Donnis, I will loan you the other $5000.  Will you also pay back the other $6500 I've already loaned you by the first of November?  This will be the last loan I will make to you.  Again, I'm glad to help, but I'm doing this for Jennifer as well.  How would you like it delivered to you?

Jeff,
 
If you could loan me the $5000, I can have that paid back to you by the first of November.  I have someone who wants the 5 acres but will not close on his house until the end of October.  I hope you will consider.  This would be the first time for me to ever own a home.  I don't have any other way of making this happen.
 
I want let you down.  This is a once in a lifetime deal for me.  I have so much to gain by this.  If I ever had to sell the house, it is worth $145,000.
 
Thanks,
 
Donnis

Jeff

First, let me say on behalf of The Temple how grateful I am for your desire
to make this contribution.  This will certainly make a difference for Temple
youth and I am glad to be able to help put this together.

I am sorry for your frustration. I hope to minimize that from here on out.
I am attaching a prototype of the resolution the board would pass
documenting your wishes.  Hopefully this will attach, if not call me when
you return from your trip. As you can see there will be a couple of things
to work out and I do have some suggestions for you. I will check the names
other funds to make sure they are sufficiently distinct, although I think it
will be no problem.

Give me a call after you have had a chance to look at these.

Jonathan Miller 
Kentucky State Treasurer 

December 2000 

Dear Friends, 

? ? Amidst all the holiday hoopla, I want to take a moment to sincerely thank 
you for helping make my first year in office a productive and joyous one. 
?Your interest and support have been critical to our success in making 
Treasury an office of which we can be justly proud. Consider some of the 
developments we have seen over the past year: 

? Prepaid Tuition: The office has been surging with added activity following 
the unanimous passage in the 2000 legislative session of our prepaid tuition 
bill -- the one that the Courier-Journal noted "may be remembered as the most 
lasting achievement of the session's education panels." ?Since then, we have 
named the program KAPT, Kentucky's Affordable Prepaid Tuition Plan, (Catchy 
Slogan: Keep College Costs Capped!) and convened our 12-member board to 
oversee its administration. We are on track for a Fall 2001 launch and expect 
KAPT to be extremely popular among Kentucky families who are looking for 
affordable ways to send their kids to college. 

? Unclaimed Property: That moving and shaking you hear is a direct result of 
Unclaimed Property's entry into the Digital Age. ?Less than three months ago, 
claims were processed manually -- a cumbersome task, to say the least. ?But 
that was then. ?Now that Unclaimed Property has interfaced with ?the state's 
centralized accounting system, efficiency has soared. ?No fuzzy math here. 
?We have paid 7,036 claims from January 1 through November 30th -- more than 
double the year before. ?And with the addition of a search function on our 
web site which allows claimants to look for property online, we were able to 
give back over 3 million dollars to rightful owners. ?This marks the best 
year in the history of the Unclaimed Property Program. 

? Accounting: When I first started in my position last January, the state's 
accounting system found Treasury behind in bank reconciliation -- balancing 
the state's accounting transactions with its depository transactions. ?Within 
three weeks, we forged an alliance with the Finance Cabinet to solve the 
problem. ?Less than one year later, we can claim complete success. ?It's 
official: All of Treasury's bank accounts have been reconciled. ?? 

? Systems: Treasury has given the phrase "the check's in the mail" new 
meaning. ?The year 2000 saw our savvy tech staff usher in a new era with the 
adoption of state-of-the-art, check-sealing equipment. ?This means that 
checks are processed and transmitted to taxpayers more efficiently. ?It also 
means that the age of smoke and fire alarms in the Capitol Annex due to 
faulty equipment is finally over! 

? Public Outreach: Treasury has made great strides to improve communication 
with the public. ?We continue to develop Treasury's new and improved web 
site, with a special emphasis on making www.kytreasury.com more user-friendly 
and on building our in-house capacity to keep it online and up-to-date. ?This 
is important to ensure that all taxpayers have access to Treasury's unclaimed 
property database and information regarding the pre-paid tuition plan. 

? Philanthropy: ?This year, Treasury raised the bar on philanthropy. ?Our 
office was 269% over the 1999 participation rate for the Kentucky Employees' 
Charitable Campaign. ?Our spirited employees gave to the fund in more ways 
than one. Exhibit A is Treasury's fundraising softball team. ?Word is that 
out on the field, we made the Department of Agriculture actually look like a 
farm team. ?For its outstanding efforts, Treasury was recognized by KECC and 
given awards for Most Valuable Player and Best Overall Campaign.  

These are just a few of the highlights that I can recall from the last year; 
It is, of course, next to impossible to capture them all in a newsletter. 
?But that said, I want to thank you again for giving me this opportunity to 
serve Kentucky. ?It is because of you that I can eagerly anticipate my second 
year as State Treasurer. ?And it is large part because of you that I am so 
thoroughly grateful this holiday season. 

Best wishes to you and your family. 

Jonathan Miller 
State Treasurer

Hi Jeff-
Hope things are well with you.  Classes started here this week and I'm
still getting my schedule straigtened out.  Fortunately, I got into the
Speculative Markets course.  However, I still need to choose a second
finance class.

I have until friday at 3 PM EST to choose between FIXED INCOME (dealing
primarily with bond replication, fairly quantitative) and FUNDING
INVESTMENTS (a broad examination of how firms finance investment with
corporate securities).

Which of the two do you think would help me out the most at Enron Global
Markets?  Sorry for the short notice, but I just won the course permit
tonight!

Thanks,
Matthew

Jeff

Attached are the final drafts of the resolutions which I will introduce at
the board meeting tonight.  Of course the resolutions will be contingent on
the transfer of stock and I hope you will feel free to call me if you have
any problems with the transfer or if I can help in any other way.

I do hope you will send me some language and a photo for an appropriate
article in the bulletin.  I would like the congregation to know about your
generosity and the importance of our youth leadership programs.

Thank you again for everything. I look forward to seeing you on the 30th.

Jeff,

Hi, I Donnis, Jennifer's mom.  I know we have not formally met but I fill like I know you.

Jeff, I am in serious trouble.  During my dad's last few months, I had to pay his expenses plus most of his funeral. As a result, I am now in forclosure on my home.  The worst part of that is my husband does not know.  He can't find out because he would kill me and I am not just using that as a figure of speech. I am very scared.  Jennifer must not know because she is on top of the world right now and she doesn't need to have my worrries.

Jeff could you please loan me $6500 just for a few months.  I can reinstate the loan but I have to do it within the next 24 hours.

I know this is very strange for you but I am so desperate that I can not eat or sleep.

I am not usually like this but I have noone that can help me.

I can be reached at 281-703-5935.

Thanks,

Donnis

Subject: lng shipping

jeff
long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

Dear Jeff,

Happy (somewhat belated) new year.  I hope you are doing well in sunny
downtown Houston.  I am writing from Princeton where minutes ago I
happily finished my Economics exam, the last of the semester.  In
reviewing the agenda for the rest of the academic year, I thought it
might be a good time to finalize summer plans as well.
     I will be occupied with a job here at Princeton until June 3 - I am
working logistics for part of this year's reunions.  After that date, I
would need only a day or two of turnaround time before coming out to
Houston.  I could conceivably be in the office by Wednesday, June 6.
Depending upon your needs at the office and the possibility of a short
cultural study on a small island off of the coast of western Sumatra, I
could plan on being in Houston until at least early August.  Please let
me know what your plans are on the other end.

Thanks in advance for your attention.
Sincerely, Dan

Hi Jeff!

This is so very exciting! I will write you an official "thank you" from
Temple, but I also wanted to fly you an email again. I look forward to your
Bulletin Article and as a mother of 2 Youth Groupers, I would love it when
you are in town some time next year (youth group is kind of down for the
summer now) to have you come and speak to the kids, if you would. All of us
ex-TYGers have a powerful message and yours will certainly reach these kids.
Thank you again!

Warm regards,
Julie Benson

Jeff,

I wanted to send you a copy of the presentation we have given to the
following banks in London last week:

ANZ
Christiana
Chase
ING Barings
NIB (small niche shipping Dutch bank)
BNP Paribas
Citibank
ABN AMRO

I wanted to set up meetings with a combination of Enron's tier 1 banks and
niche shipping banks.  Andrew Makk,
myself, Pierre Aury, Andy James and Simon Crowe (works for Paul Chivers)
attended the meetings from Enron's side.
Simon did a good job coordinating all the meetings and we were well
received in terms of banks agreeing with our value
proposition.  We marketed to them in regard to being able to provide risk
management solutions for their loan portfolio and
asked for their input regarding the shipping market today and in the near
term.  Pierre and Andy were very appreciative of the
information and effort to help their business.  It was a very good learning
experience for the Enron team.  We have solid leads
with each of the banks.  I will let you know if I hear of anything further.

On another note we will be meeting with Fuji and CSFB next week to hear
their updated input on how best to finance
the Jose project.  We have also been visiting with multiple people in
London related to the Sutton Bridge structure and several new ideas.
Andrew
and I have also been visiting with Eric Gonzales in regard to our options
to extract maximum value as soon as possible from the Jose project.
I hope all is well and I sent a similar message to Mike.

Regards,

-Larry-

EGM has the largest number of trading books in the company with over 500 active books and despite this you guys do the best job getting worldwide information to us in a timely and accurate fashion. (I wish I could get the rest of the company to this point). I'm told that the people referenced below have contributed in a big way to this effort. Thanks for the effort. Rick

Rick,

Following up on our discussion this morning, Scott Earnest and his staff ( including Michelle Bruce) need to be recognized for their outstanding efforts in providing timely information to Risk.

Their initiative came along about the same time Jeff Shankman took over Global Markets; it enables them to run a same day VaR for worldwide trading ( Houston, London and Singapore books are all closed in Houston ) as well as for us to to get our "official " information reliably by the the opening of business next day.

Dear Jeff,

Sorry I had to get  off the phone so abruptly.

I am glad to hear that you are still interested in the Butterfield for
Enron. It would be an amazing piece for the collection and a unique early
piece for $200,000.00 seems much more appealing than a recent bronze
multiple for $225,000.00. This is an amazing piece though I am afraid that
the email image is probably not very good.

The following are the details:
ARTIST: Deborah Butterfield
TITLE: Goldie
DATE: 1980
MEDIUM: wood, iron, steel, plastic, wire, etc.
SIZE: 77" x 101" x 41" (life size)

Just so you know, the Butterfield is in a crate in SF.


Yours truly,
Michael Rosenfeld

Jeff,

Thanks again for being the featured speaker for the video conference series.  SEE THE COMMENTS BELOW!
----- Forwarded by Karen Marshall/HOU/ECT on 04/03/01 02:48 PM -----


	"Charles Earthman" <Charles.Earthman@mba02.bus.utexas.edu> 04/03/01 10:39 AM 	   To: <Karen.Marshall@enron.com>  cc:   Subject: feedback on the Video Conference this past Friday	





Karen, 

Please extend my personal thanks to Jeff and the others involved for the video conference last Friday.  A few highlights for me:

Jeff/Enron's attention to the speaker's background--referencing the questioner's resume in formulation of his response--was impressive.  Further, as the vast majority of the attendees on the UT side were first year students concerned with future employment, the fact that someone as high-level as Jeff looked at the resumes was of real value.  That level of exposure can be hard to come by. 
The relaxed atmosphere was also pleasant and encouraged the question-and-answer process.  
It was abundantly clear that Jeff was eager and able to authoriatatively speak on a wide variety of topics.  This was the heart of the value of the conference.

Thanks again and best regards,
Charles Earthman 
Class of 2002

Jeff,
As you suggested last week, I am letting you know that I have yet to hear
from Jeff about setting something up.  I did manage to speak with Michelle
about what she is doing and I was exited about what she had to say.  let me
know how proactive I should be about getting in touch with Jeff.  Hope you
are well.
Nat

Dear Jeff,

I am working with our chairs, Claudia Lummis and Isabel Lummis, on our annual 
Gala.  I have been holding the following solicitation letters
until I spoke to you regarding the ask.  Karen Soh asked me to wait until the 
New Year.

Jack Cogen, NATSOURCE, $10,000 in 2000
Jeff Hawn, McKinsey & Co., $5,000 in 2000
Rocky Emery, Paine Webber, Inc., $5,000 in 2000

Please let me know how to proceed this year.  Are these contacts still good 
and how can we best approach them this year.  If you have other ideas about 
potential donors, please let me know.
Thank you very much for assistance.  I look forward to hearing from you very 
soon.

Sincerely,

Grace Pierce
Contemporary Arts Museum
Assistant Director of Development

Jeff, we talked last week about Ozzie Pagan coming to the FPL meeting.  My 
thoughts are that the deals Ozzie are talking about it are great and could 
very well be a part of what we do with the LNG deal, but I doubt the meeting 
will get to that level of detail.  If we get the LNG deal and a possible gas 
transaction on to FPL's radar screen, then we will have accomplished alot.  
Having Ozzie there as Enron's Florida power project developer may be too 
distracting.  As part of the many follow-up  meetings we will hope to have 
with FPL, Ozzie can make his pitch to them.

If you concur, I'll let Ozzie know.

Thanks

Hi - Thanks for your message last night.  Sorry you're having to work so
late.  Hope it's an exciting deal or deals you're working on at least
(though I know it's hard to "feel the excitement" consistently from morning
to  . . .morning).

Jeff,

Hi there......sounds like Penny has been equally emphatic on both sides
about meeting...

So sorry not to have responded earlier ...it has been such a completely
psychotic week for me. I have been in London and Stockholm this week - I
don't think I slept more than 3 hours a night all week. I am on my way
tomorrow to India (Bombay and Bangalore)...London on Thursday...and back to
New York on Thursday night or Friday morning. Friday and Saturday (April 13
& 14) are fairly free for me - would Friday night work for you?

It will be difficult for me to reach you from India- given schedule and time
difference, but I will be accessing email. I can be reached on a mobile
number in Europe on today and on Thursday - ++44 7990 973 620. As of Friday
- in New York, the best place to reach me is on - 1 917 862 6552. By the
way, how is the Peninsula post-renovations? I liked it before the
renovations - am sure its even more wonderful.

Elizabeth

Hi Elizabeth,

I'm Penny and Sam Britell's friend (Sam's from college) who have
mentioned (truthfully, insisted) that we should get together for a drink
next time I'm in NYC.
I'll be in new york sunday the 7th through the 14th and would love to
get together for that drink Penny and Sam keep telling me about.
Fortunately I have a pretty open schedule next week, so if you have any
time, I'd like to meet you.

I'll be staying at the Penninsula next week, or feel free to call me on
my cell phone at 713 854 4952.  As well, I'll be checking voicemail in
the office (713) 853 1761.

I'll be out of the office the next two days, but leave a message if you
have time.

Regards,

Jeff

I reached Greg today and had a nice conversation. He encouraged me to call 
you.  

Having missed you today I wanted to make a few suggestions. 
With regard to your reservations about an investment in plant and equipment- 
I understand that any such investment would be: limited and subject to your 
being very attracted to the deal. I am confident that I can bring you deals 
that will sell themselves. 
-need to have an exit strategy that would allow an exit within 2-4years 


A trading strategy without investment in plant and equipment will yield 
attractive results. 

With regard to how that would look - I will draft a short business plan and 
send it to you next week basing it on a pure trading basis.  

Let me invite you and Greg to a breakfast (or any other meal) during the week 
of 16 Jan. That will give me a chance to get a few numbers in your hand 
prior. 

Regards for the New Year
