Louise,

I would like to give you an update of GTV II inception document. I have obtained the signatures from most people on the sign-off sheet except Colleen Sullivan, Philippe Bibi, Beth Perlman, and Dave Nommensen, Colleen has been out. Philippe and Beth both have been out this week. Dave Nommensen did not want to sign the document. He felt that he could not sign it without having been involved in the requirement gathering or project estimations. Last week when we were working on the new requirements and the project estimate, Dave was on his spring-break vacation.

I will try to get Philippe and Beth's signatures when they are back early next week.

The development has started today. I will keep you updated on the progress of the development.

Regards

Zhiyong

Hi Louise,

Can you give me some background on Z's promotion. A knock on result of this is that there are now 9 people being promoted in IT in the US to Sr Director which seems high to me.

Thanks
MRP

Louise -

While we were looking at opportunities for Offline and the value proposition a potential software vendor might make to banks, we stumbled across 
"Asset Backed Securities" and its complete lack of market making.    It appears to be a very large market, controlled by "dealers" who control issuance
of ABS commercial paper, and among themselves control an informal secondary market.   

Given the size of the market, and the players who seek to issue the paper (GE, Siemen, Ford, credit card companies, etc.), I was curious as to how Enron would
view the opportunity.   My original intention for this piece was to talk to a bank or two about how they might use our system to do this themselves and 
outmanuever the "controlling dealers".

Also a firm has opened for business that purports to bypass the "issuance process" at a much lower cost, but has no way to help a secondary market
along.  If we could work with them on a "secondary market", perhaps this could evolve.

We have had some positive feedback from Rahil, Brandon, and Tom Gros  but I thought you might provide an overall corporate view!

Thanks -

David

Louise,

with regards to the TIBCO compatability issue.....

If you dont want to wait for the Windows 2000 migration in mid May, it appears that migrating to TIBCO 6.5 in NT4 requires running a migration script that takes about 15 to 20 minutes, but there is a risk that there would be some interruption if the migration doesn't go to plan.

We could go for this Friday, and the Infrastructure team are already working on modifying a version of the migration script to work on Windows NT4, in anticipation.

Another option would be ask the  Windows 2000 migration team to switch their roll-out schedule around to pick up the single-deal entry users earlier

Please let me know if you are prepared to wait for the Windows 2000 roll-out. 

regards

Steve

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Louise,
 
I need to bring this to close.
 
I am going to decompose Beth's group into a number of smaller units, leaving the most important areas in ENA, namely GAS/Power Front and Back office. I am going to leave Anthony running EES, but need someone who can work well with Anthony on developing the strategy for the new longer term solutions, as well as what he is trying to achieve in the short term.
 
The final candidates are Steve Stock, Everett Plant, and as possible late entry John Paskin (although he doesn't know this yet and I have him tagged to run Corporate Systems). From a collaboration perspective I am leaning towards Stocky. We have all spoken with Everett and are impressed with his 'gloss'. I'm just not sure he is the right person to give the 'crown jewels' to, my gut tells me he is good at managing up, but may not be the best collaborative team member (and I need that).
 
Let mk know what you think
 
Thanks

Louise:

It is my understanding that, notwithstanding the new vs. used election entered into iBuyit, IT deploys used prior to ordering new equipment.  It is also my understanding that this is especially the case for flat panels in light of the decision to outfit Enron Center South with new displays.

Subject:	RE: ibuyit or IT

Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.  

A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.

Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.

As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.

As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.

Thanks

Louise

Here's a little issue.

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

Thanks

Louise

I would like to move forward with what we are calling Phase III for EOL.  Most of the work is done but in this environment, I don't want to prepare to roll it out in January without your views.  However, if we are to roll it out in mid-January, we need to agree soon.
 
Richter has sent you the outline/presentation on e-mail and he and Savita and Jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like. 
 
Savita discussed the presentation and the plan with John Arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality. 
 
Basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page, but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static Reuters content down the side (which will be put in a MyContent button).  This isn't expensive, most of the work is done anyway, but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded.
 
I think it would be positive to do.  It looks better, the Reuters content can be found in a MyContent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience.  It also shows business as usual with EnronOnline.
 
Your thoughts?

Beth,

Per my other note, see enclosed the computational science related projects.
The point here was to explore the possible development and marketing of very
high bandwidth services such as teleimmersion, telepresence, and various
collaboratory techniques. Computational power on demand from large
computational grids which could be bought and sold like electricity is
another project under development at the Lab. Again both ideas involve
collaborations between our organizations to develop new approaches that
ENRON could transform into new commodity items that could be traded.

I also am interested in exploring new approaches in energy storage via new
generation flywheel energy storage systems that would be installed at
substations. These units would allow companies to store power at night while
rates and demand are lower and then use it during peak periods. The idea
here is that this would provide more power as needed without new electrical
infrastructures. These systems could be used again as a new commodity,
electric power storage space.

All of these items are in the development stage, but with sufficient
additional funding and technical collaboration from ENRON and its partner
companies, new value from new services could be generated.

We also are a leader in developing high temperature superconductivity wire
for use in electric power cables which will enable considerably more power
to move through the same "space". This will enable areas that are power
strapped (and space constrained such as in large urban areas) to push more
electricity without very expensive upgrades to the related infrastructure
such as roads, sidewalks, buildings,etc.

I have provided a few URLs below for your associates review. Our homepage is
at http://www.anl.gov which is the launch site for much of the information
on the labs capabilities. We also have a software shop under the technology
transfer button on the top row, middle section which might be of interest to
you.

Ross,

My eyes must have crossed when I was typing the URL's. I'll give you the
corrected URLs below:

http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/DOE2000/collabs.html

http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/division/research

I've also added one additional URL below.

http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/fl/projects.htm


You also may want to go to the Mathematics and Computer Science Home page at
http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov. Select either the research or collaboration
buttons and take a very quick tour through the topics of your interest.

Thanks again,

Steve Lake

Stephan--

Thanks for the message and I enjoyed our discussion yesterday  -- I do want
to investigate your collaboratories a bit, but the links you bring me to a
page that cannot be displayed.  Do you have an alternative URL address?

Thanks
Ross

   Ross,

   I enjoyed talking with you today regarding your business. As we
   discussed
   I'm attaching a few URL's that describe our research in various
   collaboratory and immersive environments.

   http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/DOE2000/collabs.html

   http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/division/research.html


    The goal of this work is develop technology to assist collaboratory
   actions
   over high bandwidth environments. Scientists, engineers, designers, and
   probably bankers, lawyers, accountants and other professional staff will
   have significant new tools in forming and working a collaboration forum.
   The
   bulk of this research is done in our mathematics and computer science
   division.

   You may also notice an additional collaboratory activity which is
   telepresence. In this case scientists can remotely manipulate scientific
   equipment such as electronic microscopes as well as discuss the results
   with
   others as the experiment is underway. This approach actually allows
   collaborating parties to reach out and control machines safely over the
   internet. This is far beyond just changing a camera angle or moving a
   microscope stage.

   I've also included a URL on the computational grid concept which
   provides
   heavy computational power on demand in a way not dissimiliar to the
   electric
   generation and distribution business.

   http://globus.org

   If your clients are faced with the need to access enormous files of hard
   copy information that needs to be put in a manner that can used easily
   over
   the internet, we have developed an interesting approach. DOE has over
   250,000 pages of hard copy documents from various sources on the human
   radiation experiments conducted over many years. These documents can
   easily
   be accessed and manipulated through an special search engine. Our other
   information research division, the Decision Information Sciences
   Division
   built and operated this application. You can view it at:

   http://www.dis.anl.gov/disweb/datt

   As a side note, this division has unique skills in developing technology
   to
   solve problems that have enormous amounts of date. The division also has
   developed energy planning software, and trained many foreign government
   energy planners on the use of that software.

   Regards,

   Steve Lake
   Argonne National Laboratory

Louise,

I've seen a list where you nominate a set of business sponsors to represent NA interests, and it appears that the intention is to have single points of contact for each of the budget buckets.

However, there are a number of horizontal initiatives, such as Global Data, that cut across all of them.

Is it your intention that we take the horizontals to all the people listed, or will you nominate one to evaluate the budget numbers?

regards

Steve

Louise / Greg,
 
here is the updated spreadsheet (password 5555).... we miscounted slightly the total is 131 not 126. 
 
Geoff Storey asked me to make sure Larissa Sharma was included in the group as well.
 
The area colum hasn't been altered to reflect the 'new' role yet...... we've had to stop for a moment to find over 700 telephone numbers.... :(
 
regards
 
Steve

We completed an assessment and found that the variable operating costs were not as competitive as other alternatives in the marketplace.

George,
 
We are pretty sure DealBench is the cheapest in the market place -  we are way below others for costs.  Do GSS use DealBench for all our sourcing now?

As you know, we have used DealBench as our auction platform since inception and have been very pleased with the results.  Unfortunately, the costs associated with this proprietary platform make it cost prohibitive for Enron to sustain.  I would suggest that the more prudent approach is to determine the aggregate demand for such services and to utilize GSS to contract and manage a third party service/auction platform for Corp. and the commercial business units.

Subject: DealBench in 2002



As you know, we have an application in ENW called DealBench.  This application allows deal rooms, data rooms and auctions.  
 
ENW has done a complete review of this application and determined the following:
 
(1)  It is very difficult to build a successful, externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an ASP format.  Outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in July 2001.
 
(2)  A change in the eCommerce landscape combined with Auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property.  ENW has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since April with no outright bids.
 
(3)  However, the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons.  According to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs. actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred, Enron business units realized approximately $8 million in value.  In the past, ENA has done 13 data rooms, EES did 2 live auctions, EBS did 3 live auctions, Corp. did 4 live auctions, tax did a deal room and NBPL did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non-Enron clients.
 
Therefore, the question going forward is if several business units in Enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002.  The total estimated expense for the application (depreciation, ongoing technical and commercial support, etc.) is $2 million for 2002.  
 
If a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon, that would be great.  The application works well and has provided real value to Enron.  If there is not enough interest in it, I will discuss with Whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down.
 
Thanks.

Louise,

I believe what you are seeing is names of Enron Networks employees who are placing orders on behalf of ENA. When this happens these employees are responsible for obtaining prior approval for the responsible party within the cost center their are ordering for. Additionally all IT hardware purchases must be reviewed and approved by a technical buyer once the cost center financial approval is obtained. Therefore, some of the individuals which you see listed in the approver 1 and approver 2 columns will not be ENA employees. 

Please advise if you have any additional questions.

Thanks
John

About a month ago I held a  meeting in Houston to bring together the systems, operations, and commercial people who were responsible for designing and building our wholesale and retail systems.  There were probably twenty people there, including Beth Perlman, Anthony Dayao, Beth Appollo, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Lloyd Will, Todd Busby, Greg Woulfe, Rogers Herndon, Murray O'Neil, Steve Nat, Jeff Richter, Thresa Allen, Pablo ?, Mark Pickering, Dale Furrow, and many more.  

Two of my suspicions were confirmed in this meeting.  First, it was clear that there were a bunch of people working in silos.  Beth's group was just starting to talk to Anthony's group.  The site profile team wasn't on the same page as Richter who wasn't necessarily in sync with Herndon.  EES and ENA (and for that matter east ENA and west ENA) volume management and RTO settlements people weren't talking to one another.  Second, it was clear that nobody had tried to map out what all of the necessary functions are and how they should fit together.  We tasked Todd Busby, Debra Bailey, and Lloyd Will to spend a month talking to each group and "drawing the picture" of all of the systems that were being worked on and how they should fit together.  They brought in a couple of people from Accenture to assist with this project.

The powerpoint presentation below documents their findings.  I would encourage you to look at pages 11 through 15 which summarize the issues and recommendations.  Here are the highlights:
Power IT and operations remain organizationally divided between Wholesale and Retail
Settlements development efforts are not global
Create one power IT & one operations organization for retail and wholesale power
Create power program management team to coordinate business requirements for trading, risk, settlements & volume mngt across wholesale and retail desks

Our systems and operations efforts are in chaos right now in terms of getting prepared for the future of wholesale and retail power.  If you think about how decisions and priorities are established you have a half dozen commercial people (me, Richter, Presto, Will, Herndon, Woulfe, ...) working with a few operations people (White, Appollo, Albrecht, O'Neil, Hall) and a handful of systems people (Dayao, Nat, Stock, Perlman) to come up with a plan.  It just isn't working.  We need a structure and we need it fast.  Chaos is expensive and ineffective.

Here's what I want:
One Operations Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power
One Systems Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power
One Commercial Person Responsible for Overseeing All Wholesale and Retail Power Systems Development
One Project Manager Working for the Commercial Person to Coordinate and Run Herd Over These Efforts.

There are a number of variants of what I want that could work.  We need to get this thing figured out ASAP.  Please advise on how you recommend moving forward.

Tim,

I made the following changes to the presentation which are not required for your distribution if you have already sent it out:

1.  page 10 first bullet - changed "one power and operations organization" to "one power and one operations organization" .

2.  page 11 - modified colors to clarify point

o	Released to production.
?	Gas Daily options (phase 2):
o	Released to production.
?	Basis Options (phase 2):
o	Development of deal entry type for Basis Options has been completed in TAGG.
o	Development of loading correlation curves has been completed.
?	Transport Deal Capture & Valuation (phase 2):
o	Creation of new deal entry type & database changes has been completed.

Plans for the week ending 6/29/01:
?	Continue IT development of Phase I items.
o	Optimize the position manager's performance.
?	Continue IT development of Phase II issues.
o	Change PortCalc to value spread options.
o	Option reports (PL reports).
o	Change to TAGG/ERMS Translator for transport deal capture.

Issues:
None

Notes
?	Position roll-up process hangs sometimes in the production environment. This bug has been fixed in the parallel environment. The developer is now applying the fix to the production code.
?	The performance of loading curve to the position manager has been improved in the parallel environment. The same change will be applied to the production code.
?	We need to look into the current way of computing curve shift for Gas Daily options because it creates a large second order amount.


 

Thanks

Louise, 

I heard you were looking for a contact list for applications, and had been passed a spreadsheet to update, that had all the business areas, leads and their directs....

We already have an escalation list for applications (see attachment),  and people are supposed to maintain it in LiveLink.... will this do as is?, or would you like it in the same format as the spreadsheet? 

I've attached a Word Doc version, in case you can't get to the LiveLink URL below.

regards 

Steve

Did you know that  Application Development & Support has a list of escalation contacts for all applications we support?


The Application Escalation Contact List provides information on who to contact (and how to contact them) regarding issues with applications supported by Application Development and Support. 

To view the Application Escalation List, click here -> http://edms.livelink.enron.com/ena/livelink.exe/10703143/Application_Escalation_List.doc?func=doc.Fetch&nodeid=10703143. It can also be found in the "Trading Applications - Internally Developed" section of the Need To Know Website (<http://needtoknow.corp.enron.com/>). 

How to Update the Application Escalation List
Since the list is a valuable tool for both the Resolution Center and other developers, it is critical the list be kept up-to-date. Please note that changes to the Application Escalation List are also made in the new IT Contacts Website, which is primarily used by Infrastructure. You only need to request a change to the Application Escalation List.  Please email me your changes as they occur and I will ensure both the Application Escalation List and the IT Contacts Website are updated.

Below are a few reasons you may need to update the Application Escalation List:
?	Staffing/Organization Changes
?	New Applications
?	Applications No Longer in Existence
?	Contact Method Changes (New Numbers, etc)

Thanks!

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Louise,

I would like to give you an update of GTV II inception document. I have obtained the signatures from most people on the sign-off sheet except Colleen Sullivan, Philippe Bibi, Beth Perlman, and Dave Nommensen, Colleen has been out. Philippe and Beth both have been out this week. Dave Nommensen did not want to sign the document. He felt that he could not sign it without having been involved in the requirement gathering or project estimations. Last week when we were working on the new requirements and the project estimate, Dave was on his spring-break vacation.

I will try to get Philippe and Beth's signatures when they are back early next week.

The development has started today. I will keep you updated on the progress of the development.

Regards

Zhiyong

Attached is a draft spreadsheet that captures the budget items reviewed with IT yesterday.

I have tried to correlate our description with their project name.  I have also created a starting budget and proposed budget for your review.  A % allocation row for east, west and cdn allocation has also been created for your review and comments.

The overall IT budget was brought down from 25.4MM to 16.3MM. 

Please review for any final comments as well as you comments on allocations.  Please note that the largest item was power fundamentals (6.2MM) which has bundled in it remote support, VMS support ect, it is IT's overall catch all accounts that require direct support of delivered  systems.

Louise:

Thanks for your note and support.

The response you received is both incorrect and unacceptable.  I will personally look into this and revert back with a solution.

My sincerest apologies,

George

So, it all came to pass.  Per our discussion a long time ago - I am now having the problems envisaged with ibuyit.  I have never received an approval request from any of my direct reports.  I have contacted the ibuyit team and asked why not?  Has no-one reporting to me ordered anything?  The response from the team was that they were unable to tell me what the issue was and that I should ask each one of my direct reports to look at the system next time and tell me who they were sending their applications to.  The ibuyit administration team cannot assess this information (ISC helpline).

Please help this is very frustrating - I am trying to be pro-active but its hard.

Louise and Geoff,

Please find the attached file for the latest Statement Of Work for the Consolidated Gas System project. I have only revised the Estimated Costs section to match the final budget for the project next year. The preliminary work done this year will be charged to some existing projects. This is the Statement Of Work for the phase 1 (physical) of the project. The Statement Of Work of the phase 2 (financial) will be delivered in a few weeks. Please review the document. I would like to request your signature some time next week.

Thanks

Zhiyong

I will talk to George.  

I am not sure Philippe stopped using them but I thought he shut off their carte blanche building access.

Do you remember the problems you guys had with PWC and Enron Offline when they remarketed without your permission.  Philippe told me you guys had cut them off but I saw George Wasaff bring them in to see Mark today and George told me that he is using themin several different locations.  You and George may want to discuss as they did stepway out of line with you guys.

After consulting with the personnel of the remote team, we have assessed their needs, and are prepared to begin the initial swap-out of CRTs for Flat Panels to the various locations.

Our first targets are Toronto (10 18" flats) and Calgary (25 15" flats). 

As we receive more through additional moves, we will include Portland, New York, Chicago, and other locations as needed.

I just need to know that everyone's okay for us to begin this process.  Thanks.

As you each have heard over the past few days, EnronOnline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002.  We intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services (in the form of products, transactions, and development) are charged on a usage basis, allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way.  My assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget.  I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look forward to meeting with you.

Brad Richter

Dear Louise,

I am responsible for the Daily Position & Violation Reporting.  With the change in your role, I would like to set up a half hour with you to go over this reporting and find out from you if there are other things that you would like to see.

I will try and get something on your calendar this or next week.

Budget update/suggestions:
=20
Piper, Richter, and Webb met with Whalley this Saturday for a few hours on =
overall EnronOnline strategy and budget.  We showed him the development com=
pleted to date and the general development list going forward.  We also sho=
wed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last 1=
2 months.  We also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forwa=
rd.  Finally, we showed him the same suggested EOL budget plan we showed yo=
u, including 2001 plan vs. 2001 forecast vs. 2002 plan as well as the alloc=
ation methodology.  Greg is generally OK with the total 2002 plan number fo=
r EOL ($37.7 million fully loaded with bonus, indirects and depreciation), =
why we want that money and where it would be spent.  What he did not like w=
as the allocation methodology, which is currently cost based and based on d=
evelopment and products.  He suggested a charge that included a fixed fee p=
lus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transacti=
on charge, etc.  Richter and Webb are researching that and will try to see =
if it will work.  I think you and I can agree the $37.7 million is good for=
 2002 but we still need to agree on your part for EA.  The current cost bas=
ed suggestion for EA for EOL for 2002 is about $22 million.  A question is,=
 will you and Lavo accept any charges for 2002 for EOL based on transaction=
s?  Sheriff also has the entire EOL suggested budget and his part.  We meet=
 EIM and EGM today on their total ENW charges.
=20
On Operations, the current suggested 2002 EA charge is $44.7 million, which=
 is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from 2001 forecast (Sal=
ly and Bob and I can explain that in detail this week).  What I would like =
to do is agree between you and I that you will accept that as EAs budget nu=
mber for 2002 plan for Operations.  What we still need to work on is how we=
 would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes tra=
nsaction counts.
=20
On infrastructure, the current suggested EA plan number for 2002 $40.9 mill=
ion.  This is down from 2001 forecast.  This does not include the $10.5 mil=
lion of controllable expense you budget directly for EA.  The issue left he=
re is what is EAs headcount, what is the headcount in IT development and wh=
at is the server infrastructure charge related to IT development that would=
 effect the EA number.  On the first issue, we have the EA headcount as rep=
resented by HR.  The current EA infrastructure charge assumes that complete=
 number.  It is larger than the number you have.  You have requested we dea=
l with some of that additional headcount differently since EA can't bill ou=
t those on a fully loaded basis.  We will work with Wes and his team on tha=
t today and tomorrow to come up with a plan.
=20
On IT Development, the current suggested 2002 plan expense number for EA, f=
ully loaded, is $$44.5 million vs. a 2001 forecast of $34.4 million.  Also,=
 the 2002 suggested capital number for EA is $50.1 million vs. a 2001 forec=
ast capital number of $50 million.  The question is, what did you get for y=

This may be of interest to you.  I was contacted by Steve Lake from Argonne National Laboratory who  is interested in selling us some of their models and mapping software.  Let me know if there is any interest.

Thanks,

Beth,
 
I  enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding possible Enron/Argonne  National Laboratory collaboration. As I mentioned, one of our  divisions, Decision Information Sciences has built state of the art tools  for modeling and simulating energy use. They have trained many country  energy ministries on the use of their tools as well as solved complex energy  technology issues.
 
I've  attached a presentation which describes some of their capabilities in this area.  Decision Information Sciences also has done much work in studying critical  infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also may be of  interest. Finally, they have been pioneers in the development of agent  based complex adaptive systems for modeling very complex systems that  are impossible to view with over approaches.
 
I will also include a copy of my  correspondences with one of your e-business groups under separate  transmission.

Louise,
 
Colin came in this morning, spent some time with the Gas team, HR and then with me, and has decided he doesn't want to come back.
 
He intends to go back to UK in Q2 and intends to chill out untill then, do some travelling etc....
 
We had a long conversation about this, and it was evident that his mind is pretty much made up.
 
He was very flattered about being asked to stay on and he wanted me to pass thanks to you for thinking of him, and is sorry to have to let you down by not accepting....
 
regards

All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Louise,

The design members will get a room for some of tonight and the entire day tomorrow and work through to get it down on paper, but it will be a best estimate by the time they finish and not completely definative, as that can only really happen at the end of an elaboration/design phase....there is no way that they could commit to a design decision for these big-ticket items in such a short space of time without compromising the quality of those decisions.

I believe you can get a draft on you desk by the end of tomorrow, but can't guarantee that it can be reviewed in that time and signed, unless we acknowledge that this is an Inception Document and not an Elaboration document.  (An Inception document states intent to kick off the project, while an Elaboration document fleshes out the details and a design is produced).

The team are trying hard to accomodate this request and I hope you will understand if they don't quite make it by EOB Friday.

regards

Steve

PS: I'll be out of the office tomorrow at the hospital, but I can be reached on 713-598-0732  or by e-mail : steve@thestockfamily.com

I am expecting a signed document -  the Phase II document was not worthwhile.  Geof listed out the information/areas that he wanted to see included in it, so I asked for them to be included.  It sounds as though Geof and your guys need to sit down and work through it today or tomorrow.

Hi Louise,

I tried to call a moment ago, but unfortunately you were engaged in a meeting.

I wanted to let you know that the message from you below has caused some concern with my team, as they are struggling to see how they can accomplish this to your satisfaction by end of this week, and Geoff Storey himself was wondering how we could even get to Transport Valuation in ERMS in that time frame.

They are heading for a draft by the end of the week, but feel extremely uncomfortable about committing to timing and full scope untill they have had more time to work through  it.

Could you please let me know if you are expecting a signed document at the end of this week?......or can I let them issue a draft to be firmed up next week instead?

best regards

Steve

I'm a bit confused - I think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small.  I would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following.

Single Deal entry revisions
Options reports
Transport Valuation in ERMS
EOL reporting tools (possible)

I would like to see Phase II include the items above and an Inception document re-issued this week.

Thanks

Louise

I'm not absolutely sure either, but I think she is saying they can provide a package that:

1) Provides IT staff that will not leave, and can backfill any attrition we may see.
2) Provide Cash for us to use as we see fit (i.e. retention) using our existing Hardware assets as collateral.
3) Help with any future integration work with the potential NewCo buyers (apparantly she knows who they are and they use IBM also, and she has contacts there).
4) Use IBM's name to help in anyway that may make the venture more likely to succeed.

Hi Louise,

Just got off the phone with Gail. She wants to know if they can help by coming up with a guaranteed offering from IBM that would help any NewCo succeed by providing IT support/direction, saving money, monetizing assets, retaining key staff and lending the IBM name, etc, etc to the deal.

If you're interested you can either call me or call her directly.

Here's a little issue.

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

Thanks

Louise

Subject:	RE: GTV II   

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

Louise -

Hope all is well. As per my voicemail, would you please consider
partcipating in a 20 minute conversation with Rai Archiboldn regarding his
report on Transaction Management Infrastructure (see attached
questionaire). If not yourself then perhaps someone on your team at EOL.

Give me a call with the appropriate name and number and I'll get Rai to
arrange a time with that person.

Thanks

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

Louise,

Thank you for your suggestion. I agree that it is critical for us to get feedbacks from Geof as early as possible. For instance, Geof suggested some changes to the design last Friday. The suggestion requires some re-work on the user interface and some changes in the daily risk management process.

I love to have the team meet Geof daily. I will check with Geof for his availability.

Thanks

Zhiyong

I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears.

Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit down around a desk to look at progress.

Let me know what you think?

Louise

Subject:	Wholesale and Retail Power Systems

About a month ago I held a  meeting in Houston to bring together the systems, operations, and commercial people who were responsible for designing and building our wholesale and retail systems.  There were probably twenty people there, including Beth Perlman, Anthony Dayao, Beth Appollo, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Lloyd Will, Todd Busby, Greg Woulfe, Rogers Herndon, Murray O'Neil, Steve Nat, Jeff Richter, Thresa Allen, Pablo ?, Mark Pickering, Dale Furrow, and many more.  

Two of my suspicions were confirmed in this meeting.  First, it was clear that there were a bunch of people working in silos.  Beth's group was just starting to talk to Anthony's group.  The site profile team wasn't on the same page as Richter who wasn't necessarily in sync with Herndon.  EES and ENA (and for that matter east ENA and west ENA) volume management and RTO settlements people weren't talking to one another.  Second, it was clear that nobody had tried to map out what all of the necessary functions are and how they should fit together.  We tasked Todd Busby, Debra Bailey, and Lloyd Will to spend a month talking to each group and "drawing the picture" of all of the systems that were being worked on and how they should fit together.  They brought in a couple of people from Accenture to assist with this project.

The powerpoint presentation below documents their findings.  I would encourage you to look at pages 11 through 15 which summarize the issues and recommendations.  Here are the highlights:
Power IT and operations remain organizationally divided between Wholesale and Retail
Settlements development efforts are not global
Create one power IT & one operations organization for retail and wholesale power
Create power program management team to coordinate business requirements for trading, risk, settlements & volume mngt across wholesale and retail desks

Our systems and operations efforts are in chaos right now in terms of getting prepared for the future of wholesale and retail power.  If you think about how decisions and priorities are established you have a half dozen commercial people (me, Richter, Presto, Will, Herndon, Woulfe, ...) working with a few operations people (White, Appollo, Albrecht, O'Neil, Hall) and a handful of systems people (Dayao, Nat, Stock, Perlman) to come up with a plan.  It just isn't working.  We need a structure and we need it fast.  Chaos is expensive and ineffective.

Here's what I want:
One Operations Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power
One Systems Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power
One Commercial Person Responsible for Overseeing All Wholesale and Retail Power Systems Development
One Project Manager Working for the Commercial Person to Coordinate and Run Herd Over These Efforts.

There are a number of variants of what I want that could work.  We need to get this thing figured out ASAP.  Please advise on how you recommend moving forward.

Tim,

I made the following changes to the presentation which are not required for your distribution if you have already sent it out:

1.  page 10 first bullet - changed "one power and operations organization" to "one power and one operations organization" .

2.  page 11 - modified colors to clarify point

louise, i dont think i can be the EOL guy for the floor. Its just not going to work like the Zie projects. They have other priorities and a different attitude. I you want to talk about it give me a call or we can talk next monday. 

The Zie projects are coming along fine: Basis Opts port calc is done and being tested by us. Flex deal viewer coming along, probably done by the end of the month. Transport Options and Option reports are under development. Going to talk to Zie about Sitara reliability cause we will have a trader revolt if it crashes again.

It is a little bit funny and a little bit sad watching the technology group try to get buyoff from Louise and the business units on 2002 budgets.  It is unbelievable that we can't get a project-based capital and expense budget for next year where someone like me can say I signed up for these 5 projects and willing to do them at such and such a cost.  If the project costs more then I'm not interested.  While there is definitely room for improvement on the technology side, the commercial side has room for improvement as well.

We had a very useful EES Risk / Wholesale Risk technology meeting on Friday.  It was clear from that meeting that Commercial, Technology, and Operations are not on the same page.  East Wholesale and West Wholesale Commercial aren't on the same page.  EES Commercial and ENA Commercial aren't on the same page.  EES Marketing and EES Risk may not be on the same page.  Anthony and Beth aren't on the same page.  Sally Beck's organization is organized wholesale vs retail while (at least on the power side) the commercial and technology groups are heading towards organized along commodity lines.  

For fear of sounding too dramatic ... the success of EES as well as wholesale Services deals is a function of our technology and back office.  Without it we fail.  The cost numbers are huge.  It is a critical point of competitive advantage.

It was amazing, we had a room full of talented people at this meeting on Friday;  I believe what was standing between us and a successful technology development effort was organization.  We are completely disorganized right now.  There are very few specs that are currently written to support next year's projects.  We have a completely inefficient, decentralized process for working through this stuff.

I have some thoughts that I'd like to share.  It cuts across wholesale and retail.  I think that we need a lead from commercial, technology, and operations for power (and probably gas).  I think the commercial person needs to drive the process and ultimately sign off on spending money for projects.  I think that we need one technologist in charge of all power systems.  I think that we need to look at everyone we have and choose the right person -- not necessarily the people who are currently leading this effort, although Anthony and Beth could be leading contenders.  We need Sally Beck to look at her organization and make sure that it is aligned for maximum likelihood of success.

The goal of this is not to micromanage each business unit's technology needs.  It is to coordinate and optimize across groups.  We have to make sure that we don't spend money in wholesale and retail and then develop incompatible systems.

How do you guys want to talk through this?

Answer: Go to the following link: http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering expense reports.

6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
?	The first screen only has one tab instead of two
?	New expense types were added
?	Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
?	Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
?	The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been separated out


Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.

I'd like to discuss Everett. I have to say I would have put huge money on you telling me to jump in the lake if I had suggested him. If Beth does go I would have thought Anthony would be the more obvious choice. Why is everyone suddenly buying Everett's stock - has Fallon been doing a sales job ?

No idea about Beth - she hasn't come to see me since she got back.  But I think if she does move then Everett is the perfect fit and as that group's customer I'm willing to give it a shot.

Hi Louise,
 
I heard on the grapevine that you might be considering Beth for a commerical role -true or false?
 
I also heard you were interested in Plante as a replacement - true or false?
 
See you soon (I'm in this afternoon after closing on my house).

Louise,
 
I need to bring this to close.
 
I am going to decompose Beth's group into a number of smaller units, leaving the most important areas in ENA, namely GAS/Power Front and Back office. I am going to leave Anthony running EES, but need someone who can work well with Anthony on developing the strategy for the new longer term solutions, as well as what he is trying to achieve in the short term.
 
The final candidates are Steve Stock, Everett Plant, and as possible late entry John Paskin (although he doesn't know this yet and I have him tagged to run Corporate Systems). From a collaboration perspective I am leaning towards Stocky. We have all spoken with Everett and are impressed with his 'gloss'. I'm just not sure he is the right person to give the 'crown jewels' to, my gut tells me he is good at managing up, but may not be the best collaborative team member (and I need that).
 
Let mk know what you think
 
Thanks
 
Oh, and thanks for the Baseball the other night, we had fun.

Louise,

I got your note regarding the estimated costs in CGS Physical Statement Of Work. According to my knowledge, the Indirect Expense includes overheads of HR, Corp, Accounting, Tax, Legal, Infrastructure, etc. The estimated Indirect Expense of the project for EA is $281,415. There are direct expenses associated with Steve Stock's and Beth Perlman's cost centers. The estimated Direct Expense of the project for EA is $184,107. The estimated Cost Center & Indirect Expense for EA is the sum of those two types of expenses and is equal to $465,522 that is presented in the document.

Therefore, I am afraid that my estimated project costs presented in the document do include all corporate and cost center overheads. Would you please let me know if I missed anything else?

Thanks

Zhiyong

Louise,

I know you are very busy, but I'd to discuss with you, in person, how you think it's going with GTV II and a few other things.

I'll keep it short, say 10-15 minutes, some this week or early next week, (I'm out Friday).  I'm generally in by 7:30am and out by 7pm if that helps with your schedule?

Louise,

Jenny Rub asked me to follow-up with you and pass on a summary of security/encryption on the Blackberry wireless devices.  Sorry it took a couple of days to get this back to you, but I wanted to absolutely re-confirm some of the information before I got a response to you.

We selected the Blackberry service over other wireless email services for two reasons:

It uses a "push" technology -- mail and calendar information is pushed to your Blackberry device without having to connect to a network, logon and "pull" the information.
It is the most secure of the alternatives we evaluated.

All Outlook/Exchange email that is synchronized with the Blackberry device is encrypted -- including attachments -- using triple-DES encryption.  Triple-DES (data encryption standard) is the most secure encryption standard available today for civilian/commercial use.  Each Blackberry device has a digital certificate, which is used in conjunction with our Blackberry Enterprise Server to encrypt and decrypt Exchange mail.  The Blackberry Enterprise Server is the interface server to our Exchange environment and resides inside our firewall.  Therefore, all Enron Exchange mail is encrypted before it leaves the Enron environment and is not decrypted until it reaches each Blackberry device.

There are some limitations, however.  There are three ways to communicate with a Blackberry device -- not all are encrypted.

Your Exchange mail is synchronized with your Blackberry through the Blackberry Enterprise Server -- this form of communication is encrypted using the triple-DES standard.
You can communicate between Blackberry devices using "PIN-to-PIN" paging -- this form of communication does not pass through the Blackberry Enterprise Server and is not encrypted.  However, it is scrambled -- but not using a sophisticated algorithm and it can be decoded easily by a sophisticated hacker.
You can communicate with Blackberry users via Skytel's paging service by mailing to username@skytel.com (e.g. bobmcauliffe@skytel.com) -- this form of communication is sent via clear text, so it is not encrypted or scrambled.

The bottom line is that all mail sent from/to Outlook/Exchange or internet mail sent to an @enron.com mail address is encrypted.  

If you want a little more information on triple-DES encryption, a good overview is at http://www.tropsoft.com/strongenc/des3.htm or if you want more information on our Blackberry service, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bob

Hi Louise,

I tried to call a moment ago, but unfortunately you were engaged in a meeting.

I wanted to let you know that the message from you below has caused some concern with my team, as they are struggling to see how they can accomplish this to your satisfaction by end of this week, and Geoff Storey himself was wondering how we could even get to Transport Valuation in ERMS in that time frame.

They are heading for a draft by the end of the week, but feel extremely uncomfortable about committing to timing and full scope untill they have had more time to work through  it.

Could you please let me know if you are expecting a signed document at the end of this week?......or can I let them issue a draft to be firmed up next week instead?

best regards

Steve

I'm a bit confused - I think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small.  I would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following.

Single Deal entry revisions
Options reports
Transport Valuation in ERMS
EOL reporting tools (possible)

I would like to see Phase II include the items above and an Inception document re-issued this week.

Thanks

Louise

Please find attached a revised list of staff to be retained in Beth Perman's group that I submitted to Sally and Marla earlier this evening.
Password "5555"
 
After discussions with Power, Gas and RAC several names have been added to the original list of 190 and are highlighted in red.
 
Sally originally asked me to prepare this in the same style as an earlier sheet from Anthony, but Beth's world is just too big to re-work the sheets we have been using so far. (although I'm happy to do this tonight once we've settled on the list.... I just don't want to miss anyone).
 
Instead I've used our master list, filtered out the severs and EGM/EIM, added comments and an 'Area' field to help sort the list meaningfully.
 
I've also added two extra columns 'Primary' and 'Hedge' to distinguish between the needed staff and those that we have added to account for attrition and an increased demand for reporting activities.

Thank you for this revised version.  I have signed this copy and request that a fully signed document is completed by tomorrow.

Clearly the level of specification in this document is exceptionally high which may be the reason for the very extended timescales visible in this project.  I would expect detailed documentation on each of the components of the projects in time which look at addressing the current timescales and shortening them.

Thanks

Louise,

at the moment.......Beth Perlman, Zhiyong Wei and Dave Nommensen are out of the office for a few days, so it's a little difficult to work through the resource issues. However, I've got some dialog going with some of the other technical resources (like Francis Lim, and Sanjay Gupta) at the moment.

As the TAGG/ERMS team has a large task list (prioritised by the business on a bi-weekly basis), I've asked them to produce a list of all North America tasks, paying particular attention to those that may have been poorly prioritised. I'm doing this so we can identify which resources are working towards the GTV.

I'd still like the opportunity of getting a Global Valuation presentation to you before we dismember the team though, and would appreciate 1/2 hour of your time if you can spare it, over the next couple of days. Would this be possible ?

regards

Steve

Attached are the notes from this week's  Gas Trading Vision - II status meeting and latest timeline for the project. 

Zhiyong called and asked me to review the notes and forward them to you in his absence.

In case you have not heard, he was involved in an accident this morning on his way to work. He was broad-sided pulling out of a parking lot. The impact ruptured a bone in his leg, and breaking glass hit the left side of his face. He is expecting to be out of the office for about two weeks during his recovery.  He is currently recovering at home and can be reached by phone and e-mail.

Please let me know if you have questions or need additional clarification after reviewing the notes.

Hi Louise,

welcome back! 

I trust everything is OK at home? How are you coping?

My assistant told me that you tried to call me........what's the subject?,  general catch-up?, want to know what Zhiyong wants to see you for, pick up where we left off?

I imagine you must also be VERY busy, so soon after your return to work...so here's a start..............

....where we left off...
Just before you left, I tried to get to see you to discuss the whole consolidation of Gas systems issue. We've been working through something called  Gas Trading Vision 2, which in my mind wasn't really a "vision", but more of a series of "fixes" to the exisitng systems.

I had got some overview flow diagrams completed for all the Gas Systems, and after asking lots of questions about how these systems evolved, started drawing some conclusions about why we appear to be in such a state. Apart from the obvious overlap of our several Gas systems, it occured to me that our huge team size had quite a lot to do with sheer number of technologies employed as well as the the sheer number of moving inter-related parts. For each technology employed, that skill set has to be present in the team supporting it, and most of the time these guys are not mult-skilled, so we end up with lots of individual skill sets that can't be transfered easily.

What I wanted to propose, was a serious, incremental effort, to consolidate the systems and to decommission the old ones as we went along. This would free up resources, and with a smaller technology set make them more responsive and flexible so they could be used to add value.

Note: This is not a Sitara 2, not big bang.... this is an incremental approach....

While you've been gone, we've been getting together to discuss this, (a lot harder than expected!), and have started to make a stab at identifying the component pieces, technology choices, biggest commercial impact etc....and have some pre-liminary direction.

Is this something you would back?.... or am I wasting my time?   (before you write this off completely, I would like the opportunity of talking to you about it

Zhiyong Wei...
He is probably going to ask you where you stand on project initiatives like the one above, as well as ask you what your overall vision is for the Gas Trading systems.

regards

Steve

louise, i dont think i can be the EOL guy for the floor. Its just not going to work like the Zie projects. They have other priorities and a different attitude. I you want to talk about it give me a call or we can talk next monday. 

The Zie projects are coming along fine: Basis Opts port calc is done and being tested by us. Flex deal viewer coming along, probably done by the end of the month. Transport Options and Option reports are under development. Going to talk to Zie about Sitara reliability cause we will have a trader revolt if it crashes again.

Louise--
 
I would like to meet with you in order to lay out our plans for each of the groups within EnronOnline, specifically Origination.  While I plan to aggressively look at expenses, my belief is that with a reduced staff our Origination team can create significant strategic and monetary value.  And since it's becoming more apparent that EA will be paying the lion's share of EOL in 2002, your input into our plans is critical.  Please let me know if you have time on Monday before we need to finalize our headcount plans on Tuesday.
 
Thanks in advance,
Brad

With the announcement of the Enron/Dynegy merger last week, I have rethought our planned IT management structure and am making some changes to the recent announcement. This new structure will allow us to focus our existing expertise on Enron's core strengths to ensure we continue to manage these activities effectively and efficiently and lay the groundwork for a successful merger with Dynegy.

The changes are as follows:

Steve Hotte will return to his lead role in EGS.

Beth Perlman will lead the Gas, Coal and other EGM/EIM systems initiatives. Jeff Johnson will report into Beth Perlman.

Anthony Dayao will be responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power and EES.

Paul Freeman will continue in his lead role in Europe.

John Paskin will complete his transfer to head up Corporate systems.

Steve Stock will remain heading up the newly formed Enterprise framework group. 

Jay Webb will continue to run e-Commerce.

Jenny Rub will continue to run Infrastructure.

Everett Plante will join my management team in a special projects role, focusing on a number of cross business activities in IT and working on the implications of the Dynegy merger.

Thank you for your continued support and I encourage you to continue your excellent work and give your full support to the leadership of Enron Networks.

Hi John,
 
Following our chat yesterday (see memo below). As I get into the role I will work on reducing our costs across the company. I think that if we can make the costs more apparant to the employee and their supervisors, we can make the employees self regulate what they have. i.e. buy less, save directly at the bottom line, increase Enron's profit ratio and get the stock price back up.

Jenny/Martin,
 
John Lavorato had a bit of a go yesterday about all the hardware we've ordered for the new building i.e. 8000 new screens. He complained about assistants having multiple flat screens etc and he generally complained about Bibi's policy of giving the best to everyone. He used the example of many trading houses that he has seen on TV in the recent news coverage as still having CRT's for their traders.
Can you let me know if we currently have standard configurations both in the new and old building of what we give people at certain levels.
I want us to start working on making employees understand the cost and getting them to think about saving money. We can start to do this by publishing openly the costs of each component of typical setups. We could also ask people to turn in equipment they may have that they dont need and we can redeploy (we did this effectively in Europe).
You will probably tell me we already do this, and thats good, just show me.
This will become a general theme.
 
Thanks
MRP

Attached is a report on all of the people who have posted messages to the Yahoo ENE stock discussion bulletin board between November 1 and November 20, 2001. At the top of the list is Clay Vernon, who we discussed yesterday, and who continues to post messages as "utlonghornsrule" today. Please note that not all of the comments made on the bulletin board have been negative, although it is still inappropriate for employees to be posting messages there. Please call me if you have any questions.

Louise,

My name is Molly Vaughan and I work along side your Forrester Account Manager David Kobierowski to cover the relationship between Forrester and Enron. I was hoping for an opportunity to have a 10-15 minute conversation with you to find out more about your specific role and business challenges that you may be facing.  Based on that conversation, I will be in a better position to direct you to some of the research we have that addresses those specific topics.  Let me know when a good time for me to call would be.

Link to Forrester's homepage  -->  http://www.forrester.com/Home/0,3257,1,FF.html

I look forward to working with you,

Best regards,

Louise,

I have just sent you the revised Inception Document including three additional items: Single deal entry revisions, Options reports, and Transport valuation in ERMS. After discussing with Geof, we decided not to include the EOL reporting tools this time. Hopefully, you are OK with that. Please let us know if the EOL reporting tools have to be discussed in the document.

Regards.

Zhiyong

I'm a bit confused - I think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small.  I would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following.

Single Deal entry revisions
Options reports
Transport Valuation in ERMS
EOL reporting tools (possible)

I would like to see Phase II include the items above and an Inception document re-issued this week.

Thanks

Plans for the week ending 4/20/01:
?	Continue IT development of Phase I items.
?	Obtain sign-off for GTV-II, Phase 2 issues and timeline.
?	Commence IT development of Phase 2 issues.

Issues:
Incompatibility of TIBCO version 5.x and 6.x. The single point of deal entry is done using TIBCO 6.x. Some users are still using TIBCO 5.x. Upgrading to either TIBCO 6.x or Windows 2000 is needed.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

Louise,

I understand that you will shortly receive a first draft budget submission for ENA. I'm not sure what format you'll receive it in, but if its the standard format, it'll be difficult to pick out the project level estimates.

I have access to the team/project level estimates, and would be happy to pull together a quick view that suits you.

I was going to try to guess how you would like to see it, but I thought I'd better ask you first, ....it'll probably save me a lot of work! :) The thought was to give you a quick handle on whats "essential-keep the business running" stuff, and what would be great but we can struggle on without.

Please remember this is supposed to be a quick heads-up, and not intended to replace any full explanation that will innevitably follow later.

Some alternatives (obviously, feel free to suggest your own)

1.
Capital
	Team
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $
Expense
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $

2.
Capital
	Team								% Essential	% Nice to Have
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $			40%		60%
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $			80%		20%
Expense
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $

Please let me know what you would prefer, and I'll try to get you the view by the end of the day.

regards

Steve

Louise,

I am doing much better now. Most of pain and sour is gone. Maybe it is the effect of the medication I have taken. But, I feel a lot better. Next Thursday, I will have a checkup on my leg. Hopefully, my ruptured bone will recover soon. I am planning to come back the week after Labor Day.

Thanks

Zhiyong

Louise,

Lloyd and I believe there are significant cost savings and efficiencies to be gained in the following recommendations.  We would like to present our final results Monday and would like to talk with you if possible prior to the meeting.  

With project Spark Gap, we have identified and are managing our top systems gaps and priorities for the next year.  We are setting up SAP codes for these efforts in order to more closely monitor IT progress and spending.  We have coordinated and are combining our systems requirements with the West and Canada desks in order to present a global power strategic systems vision.  

The following WHS/Retail Systems Analysis effort has made it clear that we should integrate our wholesale and retail trading systems, however, we believe organizational changes will be required in IT and Trading Support to achieve the benefits and savings.  

Please let us know if we can spend a few minutes with you prior to Monday's meeting.  

Debra

Subject:	WHS/Retail Systems Integration Analysis - Results/Recommendations

Under the direction of Tim Belden, Kevin Presto, Lloyd Will, Anthony Dayao and Beth Perlman, Todd Busby and I have completed the 3 week analysis of wholesale and retail power systems integration.  Enclosed are the preliminary executive summary presentation and the detailed information/process flow diagrams.  

In summary, we identified at a high level commonality and critical dependencies across all main trading functions within retail and wholesale.  In order to ensure successful integration of systems and processes, the team has identified the following recommendations:

1.	Consider aligning the wholesale and retail support organizations with the Gas and Power Trading.  

2.   Manage business systems requirements for power globally with a program management team sponsored by the business owners.  Consider program managers responsible for the following three areas:

Trading - Top priority to provide wholesale and retail positions and booking of shaped deals

Billing/Settlements & Volume Management - Top priority to provide retail solutions and develop global strategic systems (gas & power)

Risk - Top priority to provide retail valuation and liquidation

We will schedule a meeting next week to review the results of our analysis.  I look forward to receiving your inputs.  

Thank you for your support on this effort.  

Debra

No this is definitely not the final document.. Issues 1-3 are correct and complete, but 4 & 5 are not. 
I imagine 6-10 pages in reporting requirements for Gas Daily Options and Pipe Options alone. 

While we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1-3 and the deal entry and new deal type 
for basis options.

Talked to Forster yesterday and he can move to Duran this weekend.  He is formalizing all he can to Brad this week.  He will keep a few of his deals and coordinate with Brad and Shults on them.  Brad knows Dave will be on 31 and will call on Dave and Andy whenever he needs help.  Webb is dong a good job of training Brad as well.

Brad told me he was seeing you today as well.

Also, I changed the the STP/Accenture deal.  Assuming we do a deal with them, Enron will now own the hub, the technology, etc.  Accenture would simply channel, sell and integrate.  A split of revenues from this would be the deal.  I dropped the floor and will take on some additional cost to build some form of a hub under the smart client Jay built, but I will own/control everything and we can integrate it with CommodityLogic and the larger hub later at our discretion.

Subject:	Response to FERC: EOL

Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting from their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise and incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  Mark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim Bruno at FERC later today. << File: EOL Questions1.doc >> 

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the DC office.  

Please call me with any comments at 37007.

Louise,

attached is a plan for the roll-out of Windows 2000 for the trading groups for which TIBCO 6.x has been scripted.

 
Richard Burchfield and I are currently investigating the state of TIBCO 5.x on the Windows NT 4.0 plaftorm that is still being used, and will get back to you when we have determined if the TIBCO 6.x solution can be incorprated into a script before the actual roll-out of Win2k.

regards

Steve

I didn't realize that they were that creative.

I just talked to Bob H. and, as you probably already know, he said the system is fine and they will institute the complete patch over the next 7 days.  Close call there on data.

It was interesting meeting with the traders from EEL and Metals this week in London.  I'll catch up with you later next week.

Now look at them market makers's, that's the way you do it

You buy the nat gas on that EOL

That ain't tradin', that's the way you do it

Buying for nothin' and your commissions for free


Now that ain't tradin', that's the way you do it

Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb

Maybe get a blister on your index finger

Maybe get carpal tunnel



We got keep the spreads real tight

Nationwide delivieries.

We got to move these molecules

We got to move these electricities



The Enron trader with the fifteen flat screens

Yeah, buying sellin', he don't care

That Enron trader got his own jet airplane

That Enron trader he's a millionaire





We got keep the spreads real tight

Nationwide delivieries.

We got to move these molecules

We got to move these electricities.



I shoulda learned to get out on the web

I shoulda learned, they have it hyped in the press

Look at that volume, they are the market share leader

I can't understand why the stock's under distress

And he's 50000 up there, what's that, no nymex noises

Every one wants one, even Dynegy.

Oh, that ain't workin' that's the way you do it

Buyin' for nothin' get your commissions forf ree
