Aneel announced a major changes in the MAE, wholesale energy market, this 
afternoon.  New resolutions will be published on Monday.  We expect that the 
adjustments will address market governance through independent professionals, 
establishment of clear guarantees and penalties, as well as clear rules in 
the case of non compliance.  Enron has been a driving force in bringing this 
situation to  front and center.  
We will update as we receive more information.

Subject: Generators want to kill Annex V

The rumor mill says that generators want to revoke Annex V. No surprise. Th=
e=20
bad news is that it seems that Aneel likes the idea.

This may represent a US$ 60 million loss to Elektro, only in 2001.=20

Distribution companies are [aparently] against this measure. However, D/Cs =
is=20
short position will [likely] applaud the idea (to avoid costly exposures in=
=20
the MAE)

An Abradee group was created to think about the issue. Joao and Fred will=
=20
participate tomorrow.

A few supporting arguments.

1) Contract sanctity. Why changing the rules in the middle of the game if=
=20
Annex V was designed specifically to deal with rationing conditions?=20

2) More subtle argument. The risk of  being exposed is the only economic=20
incentive  for a D/C to reduce its load. Otherwise, we will have a classica=
l=20
"free ride" problem: D/Cs will not put any effort to reduce their=20
loads/revenues and will advocate for an ex-post adjustment on ICs based on=
=20
verified load reduction. We can build a case that in the absence of this=20
exposure, D/Cs will have no incentives to work hand in hand with their=20
clients to foster load reduction and the whole program will fail.

Debora is working on the legal aspects of Annex V, taking into account the=
=20
new MP. Sergio has talked to a few lawyers to get their views/written=20
opinions.

What about writing a letter to Pedro Parente as Enron, exploring those issu=

and explaining why Annex V is so important to the success of the whole=20
program? (the free ride issue)

Luiz,

Thanks again for maintaining a voice of sanity.  

In my not so humble opinion, it is commercial suicide for us to even give the 
appearance of supporting price caps.  I can't think of any other situation 
anywhere in the world where Enron has supported price caps in a market.  To 
the contrary, we are almost always public in our opposition to such 
market-killing sophistry.

Consensus is a noble objective, but sometimes it is just better to let people 
know your true opinion.

Rosenberg/SA/Enron@Enron 
Subject: Re: CAP no MAE  

I strongly disagree

"If it is impossible to reach an agreement within ABRADEE",, then we should 
be loud an clear in expressing our own view, to all levels of government 
including a position paper to  Pedro Parente asap.  Caps at this point in 
time may jeopardize the rationing plan per se. We had a victory in anchoring 
the penalties to the MAE price. Why surrender it now? 

Why do we have to abide by ABRADEE's desires? 

This is not a religious issue only.  There are a few US$ million left on the 
table.

How many US$ million are on the table for Enron?

 - Ballpark, possibly  US$20f or Elektro's long position  (60 in EBITDA * 
(680-460)/680)
 - A lot, lot more for Eletrobolt (perhaps to the point of killing the 
project, as Joao Albuquerque stated)

Are we being consistent? About a week ago, we submitted our views to ANEEL, 
on Public Hearing 02/2001, advocating for an increase in the cost of defict 
to US$ 2350/MWh. The trading group (Remi, David) were adamant about this 
position submitted by Regulatory Affairs (I think they are right) 

Are we acting to the best interest of our shareholders?

Subject: CAP no MAE

Algumas empresas de distribui??o short em 02 e 03 est?o defendendo fortememte 
CAP no MAE,  bem abaixo do custo do d,ficit ( cerca de R$ 680). ( CERJ, 
Cataguases, LIght est? em cima do muro, etc...)

Se for inevit?vel, nossa posi??o deve ser:

 - N?O PODE SER INFERIOR AO PRE_O PRATICADO NO PRE-RACIONAMENTO ( R$ 460,00 )
 - N?O PODE SER INFERIOR ? MAIOR TARIFA COBRADA DOS CONSUMIDORES  ( TROS 
VEZES A TARIFA RESIDENCIAL  ATUAL - 200% SOBRE A MESMA, PARA CONSUMOS ACIMA 
DE 500 KWh POR MOS) . 

Mazzon, calcule a ordem de grandeza deste valor. _ importante termos isto em 
mente quando formos falar com as autoridades amanh? e, em especial com Mauro 
Arce.

Lembrar, ainda, que um CAP baixo, sem FLOOR, pode matar ELETROBOLT, uma vez 
que as receitas que esta auferiria em 2002 n?o compensariam o decr,scimo das 
mesmas de 2003 em diante, quando, com a redu??o de mercado devido ao 
racionamento e o aumento de entrada de novas fontes de gera??o, tamb,m 
incentivada pelo racionamento, poder? derrubar fortemente os pre?os do MAE. 
N?o devemos nos esquecer que o per?odo de amortiza??o de ELETROBOLT , de 
cinco anos.

Subject: Re: Renunciando a ABRACEEL  

Luiz. After consideration of currents events we believe this in an opportune 
moment for you to resign as President of Abraceel and turn over the reigns to 
your successor.  

Two reasons.  First,  the President's position in Abraceel is one that you 
could not fill from Houston and given your imminent departure you need time 
to advise your Board and plan for an orderly transition; secondly, as 
President of Abraceel, you are called by the press to make public statements 
to defend the position of power marketers in general. This is why we wanted 
you in that role in the first place, but due to the current circumstances 
that has become a temporary liability.

When you speak to the Press, you are mostly identified by the informed sector 
leaders as Enron, no matter how thoroughly you try to clarify that  you are 
speaking as President of Abraceel. In the meantime,  Orlando is in the middle 
of intensive negotiations with the government members and some of your recent 
comments have been untimely, in that it makes it appear, in public, that the 
Crisis Management Group issue leader, in insensitive to the power marketers 
(read Enron) position, thus undercutting his leverage. That also puts you in 
an awkward position, because as President of the organization you are not 
serving the membership by not engaging in the public debate.

But this does not mean that you are not still fully engaged in the battle!. 
Your prediction that the "policy makers" are taking decisions that will hurt 
the market may come true, and if so, we Enron, will come out fighting.  

In the mean time,  we will be needing your background and knowledge to move 
our viewpoints through the open doors that have been presented to us in the 
negotiations. 

Rick Shapiro has committed your assistance to the region as long as it is 
needed. Joe and Orlando would have wished that the clock could be stopped and 
you physical departure be postponed. But they are well aware that it is not 
fair to you and your family to postpone the move. We will work something out 
so that you can provide assistance from the USA.

Thank you for your perseverance on this long fight.

Jose

S,rgio: 

As we agreed, I prepared this list of key regulatory points to be agreed 
among ourselves. The idea is that this list should serve as a basis for 
Enron's advocacy plan. As you pointed out, life has been so hectic and we 
have been in some many battle fields,  that we did not have too much time to 
discuss and agree on our update, own view. Therefore, some of us, including 
myself, may have lost sight on what is ultimately good to Enron given the 
complexity of issues and their state of flux. Given the potentially 
conflicting coalitions we are part of, this should also serve as a basis for 
defining our position and role in each of those institutions. Finally, this 
could also serve as a basis for our internal and external communication 
plans. 


Overall Guiding Principles

1) As an overrarching objective for Enron all over the world, we defend, 
inter alia, markets, competition both at retail and wholesale levels, 
contract sanctity, free prices and customer choice.

2) We will balance our short term and long term interests to maximize company 
shareholder's value;

3) We will focus our advocacy efforts on issues which have more impact on 
shareholder's value;  we will constantly talk to our multiple internal users  
to understand their needs and how those can be translated in terms of 
regulatory support;

4) We will use several coalition groups to defend our interests; We  will 
select the coalition groups more aligned with our own interests; 

5) In case Enron's interests conflict with the interests of the coalitions we 
are part of, we will defend and express our interests individually; we will 
let our coalition groups know when our interest conflict with the general 
view on a particular subject and that we will express our views separately. 

6) As a consequence of the above, the first step is to have our own view. If 
we do not know what the right way is, any alternative may look equally good 
or bad.



10 Commandment list  - Issues Related to the Current Situation of the Energy 
Sector in Brazil

1) We want the Wholesale Energy Market (MAE) to operate effectively asap. We 
acknowledge that COEX, the stakeholder board has not worked properly over the 
last 2 years. The consensus building process and the nature of the zero sum 
game issues have prevented COEX to be effective. We advocate professional, 
independent boards instead, as we do in most markets we participate 
worldwide. Informativo Regulat?rio # 3 represent our best view on the subject 
for Brazil;

2) Therefore, we applaud ANEEL in its recent initiatives to fix, inter alia: 
(i) the ineffectiveness of COEX, by replacing it by COMAE, a professional 
board; (ii) introducing penalties and guarantees for financial settlement 
(COEX was not able to introduce any in the last two years, which has resulted 
in a US$ 300 million default); (iii) we acknowledge that the Ordinances 
published by ANEEL to fix the market are legally weak and may be challenged; 
(iv) therefore, we should help ANEEL in drafting a new Market Agreement to 
enhance the governance of the new board, make MAE the organizational 
structure more effective and introduce penalties and guarantees which do not 
overpenalize our long positions (loss sharing) ; (v) we will do  our best to 
convince our peers about the proposed changes: however, if the agreed level 
is too superficial to be useful in drafting the new MAE agreement, we will 
present our view to ANEEL separately; (vi) we will advocate that companies 
trading in the free market should have a non-discriminatory treatment within 
MAE and COMAE. (vii) we will  strive to have e seat at COMAE appointed by the 
free trading association.

3) We will advocate free market prices and no caps on the wholesale spot 
price, even during rationing. (in fact, already capped at about R$ 300/MWh, 
which represents the embedded cost of deficit). This conceptual view is 
perfectly consistent with our expected Elektro, Eletrobolt, and wholesale 
position - all of them long. We will strongly oppose any government 
temptation to set additional caps on spot prices. On the contrary, we will 
support any initiative to review the current cost of deficit, which we 
believe to be underestimated. We have recently supported, as strongly 
suggested by our trading group, ANEEL's proposal to significantly raise the 
cost of deficit, particularly during rationing. We advocate that any caps on 
spot prices create disencentives to capacity expansion and therefore will 
aggravate the rationing crisis.

4) We defend Contract sanctity. In this regard, we will fight with Aneel to 
have the pass-through of non-controllable costs for Elektro, such as power 
purchases costs. Aneel has given its own interpretation to the concession 
contract, whereby any cost increase occurring between two successive tariff 
reviews should not be recovered. We defend the idea of a tracking account or 
a similar mechanism. We will take the necessary measures against ANEEL, 
either individually or as part of the distribution coalition group to defend 
our interests.

4) Along the same lines of Contract Sanctity, we will defend Annex V, which 
is a contractual provision to scale down Initial Contract volumes upon 
rationing. According to several Elektro's analysis developed thus far, 
preserving Annex VI will represent a substantial benefit to Elektro, even 
able to offset the negative impact our foregone revenues during rationing. If 
Annex V is revoked and the reduction of Initial Contracts is calculated on 
the basis of actual load redution, as proposed in the rumor mill, we will 
forego US$ 60 million in terms of EBITDA. We will refuse to negotiate with 
our suppliers (e.g. Duke, AES) any changes in the Initial Contracts which 
entail any transfer of risk/costs between generators and distributors. We 
will also express our protest to any Brazilian Government authorities tempted 
to change the Annex V, under the assumption that contract sanctity is being 
violated and that this creates additional regulatory uncertainty. We will 
also claim that revoking Annex V will jeopardize the success of the rationing 
plan because of the "free ride" effect. We will not advocate any bail-out of 
companies negatively affected by Annex V because they poorly evaluated the 
impact of Annex V when companies were privatized. We will argue that Annex V 
was designed specifically to deal with rationing situations and therefore 
there is not any excuse to  change the rules now. We will not agree to set 
additional caps on spot, not even the proposal to maintaing it as it is 
(which will represent about US$ 10 million to Elektro). (Caps are actually a 
disguised way of partially revoking Annex V)

5) We will support Aneel's Resolution 145, recently published, whereby any 
new generation (back-up, self generator), no matter its size, is allowed to 
sell to any market player, at freely negotiated prices (before they could 
sell to the host utility only). Similarly, we support any other initiative to 
give a non-discriminatory treatment to  new generation, which should be free 
to trade energy at freely negotiated basis.

6) We will support the use of correct economic signals to foster demand 
reduction during rationing. To avoid California's mistakes, we will advocate 
that the correct signals should link the wholesale and retail prices. We will 
advocate the government to establish a quota system and establish an overlay 
of correct economic signals (MAE spot prices)  for those exceding their 
quotas. We will oppose rolling blackouts on the grounds that it does not 
provide the best economic allocation of a scarce resource; nor it is 
effective for a long-term energy rationing (as opposed to California, where 
the issue was peak shaving). Furthermore, as recently pointed out by CERA, 
rolling black outs as initially proposed in Brazil are a significant 
departure from markets and will open new avenues for market  intervention and 
contract breaches. We will rebuff those who argue that there is no demand 
elasticity in electricity prices. By linking the success of the rationing 
program to free movements to the MAE price we are protecting our long 
positions both at Eletrobolt and at Elektro. We acknowledge that the increase 
in electricity prices may create a taste for energy rationing measures in the 
medium term. While the financial  impact  of energy rationing  has not been 
quantified for Elektro, we also assume the appetite for markets and energy 
services may create new business opportunities for Enron .

7) We will support ANEEL in its attempts to open the market to retail 
competition in 2003 (proposed threshold level of 50 kW). We  do not accept a 
commonly accepted argument that minimum contracting requirements for 
distribution companies are inconsistent with the opening of the retail 
market. Instead, regulatory safeguards should be put in place to prevent 
distribution companies to become stranded, by sharing this burden among the 
captive and free market segments. California CTC is an example, but 
government should look at best practices.

8) We will advocate for competition at the natural gas as a key ingredient to 
competition in the electricity market  (Informativo Regulat?rio # 1). We will 
also advocate for open access in the pipelines. We will express our contrary 
views against any discriminatory measure trying to protect Petrobr?s role as 
the sole gas supplier, in order to avoid effective competition in the natural 
gas.

9) We will leverage our best expertise to propose a solid capacity plan to 
the government, able to alleviate the energy crisis in the medium term. We 
will talk about the necessary actions to be taken to eliminate regulatory 
risks faced by generators and distributors. We will express our views on how 
to create a healthy contracting environment,  to foster competition and 
expand capacity. We will oppose any measures which create a non-level playing 
field, both at the production or consumption side. If emergency actions are 
needed, they should be used on a temporary basis only (e.g. Petrobr?s' being 
the sole provider of gas molecules and FX hedge).

9) Finally, we should take advantage of the current window of opportunities 
and all the power granted to the Ministry of Rationing to (or at least try 
to) get  the energy sector fixed toward a more competitive industry.  We 
acknowledge that the crisis will be used as a scapegoat why privatization and 
that  the competitive model has not worked. We will express our opposite 
views and we will propose pragmatic measures instead.  We acknowlege that it 
will be very difficult to reach consensus among so diverse parties/interests. 
COEX is a typical example on how the endless search for consensus was 
tantamount to lack of efficiency of the overall process. Given that, we 
should express our coherent, market based views to the Government. We will 
use our coalition groups on a selective basis whenever this attitude 
strengthens our points of view. In case conflicts emerge, we will preserve 
the coherence of our ideas as a whole.

Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time  ASMAE 
employee) was expressing her [distorted] views  to the press on why 
generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on 
behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view. 

I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from 
expressing an opposite opinion.

There are two problems in Patricia's view:

1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only 
settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract 
disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's 
frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6 
months.  Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail.

2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments. 



A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally, 
as you see fit)

1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts.
 * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as 
CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other 
agreements should not abide by their clauses?

2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions
 * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement 
without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion 
contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement 
provisions? Guess what the answer was? None

3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed 
Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98)
 *  This is serious
 *  That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not 
want to abide by Law? No response

4) Some companies do not have Annex V
 * So what? Discussion is about Annex V
 * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts

6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the 
Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk 
represented by Annex V
 *  So what?
 *  Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have 
regulated prices.
 *  Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V 
risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a 
windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors)

7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to 
mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch
 * Wrong
 *  ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place 
to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool 
operation
 *  Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called "dry 
period relief" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by 
Annel. The spot price is a "proxy" for the depth of rationing. One should not 
evoke rationing.


I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is 
"bullet proof". In the meantime, let me share my views:

 * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on 
the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should 
collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make 
this clear at the outset. 

 *  We should make Minister Patente realize  that Mario Arce's proposal is 
non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices  is 
a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known 
risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and 
Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) .  If we do want to create a 
market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting 
should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a 
poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that 
irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on 
spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts 
will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and 
worse.

 *  Generators should have the burden of proof.  In the meantime, Annex V is 
effective and should be enforceable

 * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally 
different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In 
Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could 
also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted 
irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in 
expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex 
V. 

 *  The argument "no one should lose, no one should gain" during rationing is 
inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain 
by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a 
great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously. 
Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market.

 *  We have to be as transparent as possible.

Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V 
and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week. 

I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea.

LM

Joe

We have had several conference calls since last Saturday. Perhaps you should 
talk to Orlando and join us from now on. This subject is in state of flux.

As you know, those measures triggered a hostile reaction from D/Cs and from 
Gs. 

Aneel (Jose Mario and Jose Alves) called me on Saturday asking for help. We 
discussed this subject internally over the weekend.

On Monday, Joao defended ANEEL in the COEX meeting. However, we were the only 
ones. Other players were very angry. They perceived the action as pure 
intervention (despite necessary and timely for most). ANEEL was informed 
about the COEX reaction and thanked us for our position.

We examined the Resolutions in great detail. Unfortunately, it seems that 
ANEEL went far beyond its institutional responsibilities. The substance is 
OK. The format is legally weak.

Our strategy (we will try to sell to Abradee, CBIIE, COEX and ABRACEEL) is to 
remove the spotlight from the legal arguments and propose to our industry 
peers to focus on the design of a new Market agreement (to create a sense of 
buy-in). We know that the changes will be only cosmetic. The basic principles 
of the resolution should be maintained.

As per Enron's suggestion, I spoke to ANEEL again (Jose Mario and Jose Alves) 
showing them how difficult the situation is. In our view, thard he only way 
to validate the measures is to write a new agreement (Fred and Debora are 
working on that). I was open in saying that the Resolution are weak from a 
legal standpoint. They agreed with us. Publicly they say otherwise. They said 
they are willing to negotiate. We also expressed our view to ANEEL that part 
of the reaction is parochial: some COEX members will lose their jobs. ANEEL 
agrees. That is why they are inviting all CEOs and Chairmen of the Board to a 
meeting tomorrow, where ANEEL will explain what is happening and ask for 
support from top management.

Why has ANEEL approached us? Perhaps two reasons: 1) They know we defend 
markets 2) We wrote Informativo Regulat?rio # 3, attached (which basically 
purports the replacement of COEX by a professional Board - I discussed those 
issues with Rick Shapiro before the IR was issued to understand Enron's view 
on power pool governance)

Your comments/involvement would be very important. It is a pretty delicate 
and messy situation. 

My personal view.

1) This was a necessary evil. MAE would not function otherwise. Our merchant 
plants would be in jeopardy.
2) I would dare to say that this is a "window of opportunity" to get MAE 
working (and therefore our long term strategy)
3) However, the way ANEEL did was disastrous. They should have acted long 
before. (imposing gradual penalties). Now they suddenly "fired" 26 CEOs of 
the largest utilities in Brazil
4) We should support ANEEL. However, it has to be in a very diplomatic way. 
Orlando will take care of Abradee. Joao - COEX. S,rgio CBIEE. We have to walk 
over a fine line. If we push to hard, they will reject Enron (together with 
ANEEL's Resolution) 
5) We should be the champions in drafting a new Market Agreement

Subject: MAE/COEX - ANEEL Resolutions

At the COEX meeting yesterday, it was clear from the lawyers presentation 
that there are grounds to legally challenge ANEEL's resolutions. Some 
romantic guys were kind of going in that direction.
My position  was to take the subject to a Market Assembly for the 
shareholders to deliberate.
Also everybody knows, and some acknowledged,  that MAE governance was not 
working. Our line of action at the Assembly would be to support the general 
direction of the measures, and at the same time, preserve MAE autonomy, 
opening a negotiable line with ANEEL. 
The main point of discussion will be if we should discuss without going to 
court or after challenging ANEEL in court.
The Assembly was called for next Thursday, April 26th.
Fred is going to talk to Luiz Maurer for us to have a deep exam of the 
resolutions and see what points we can propose to ANEEL to improve. Also, in 
that negotiable line, we should discuss/propose some names to the new COEX.
We need to discuss this subject tomorrow.

Great victory! No playing around with caps on MAE prices. We have to make 
sure this is sustainable (and people will actually pay for their exposures)

I am quite involved and there are lots of regulatory/governmental issues.

1) First, a comment about the $$$ requested to complete the project. There is 
no way to cover the embarrassment factor. Last December a substantial budget 
increase has requested and approved by the Board. Reportedly on a 
never-come-back-again basis. However, as it was later discovered, a) it did 
not included a number of major charges that had been spent but never 
accounted for and b) had a more optimistic scenario of project completion. 

2) Shell has not made a commitment to increase their pro-rata investment. 
They have until May 15 decide. We may have a dispute eventually leading to 
Arbitration

3) In order to improve the economics of the project, as of May 4, we are 
terminating the YPF gas contract, it is a  contract right, and renegotiating 
with YPF and others. This may be going to Arbitration.

4) And, lastly we have a full blown dispute with Furnas, inching each day 
towards arbitration/litigation before its is finally settled. The root case 
of the dispute was the interference of government agency (something -like the 
independent public Attorney's office - the "Ministerio Publico") on the 
construction of the pipeline and now its was grown into the controversy, 
involving Aneel,  because of the Cuiaba contract was the result of the Bid, 
under am old regulatory regime, and now Furnas wants us to take the market 
risks of the new regulatory system. See two files below








5) Last week we finally forced the issue with Furnas getting closer to a 
legal dispute. We put them on notice of our Contract  rights under the 
Goverment Action/Forece Majure Clauses In parallel we are also launching a 
lobbying effort to get our story across the government officials.  I have a 
more pesimistic view than  Pete about the speed of success. Logically he is 
correct,  "How can the government of Brazil allow this matter to spin out of 
control if we engage in a legal fight". He is hopeful that using our 
government levers we can get a quicker resolution. My reading is that the 
present Brazilian government is very split on energy issues and there are 
those in the government coalition that would welcome a dispute to stop the 
privatization efforts. 

I believe that we have to launch the lobbying effort for PR purposes; but 
that it will not produce results until we take Furnas to court  (not prevent 
a legal dispute)  and there is a clear reading that we are correct. The 
center piece of the dispute will be our claim of government interference and 
the analysis of our project management effort during this period of Force 
Majeure. In other words, can we collect part of the bubget overrun from 
Furnas? Our detailed analysis will be ready at the end of May.

6) On the bright side, due to the Brazilian energy crisis, Aneel  called me 
last Tuesday to let me know that it had been decided that they will extend 
the current diesel subsidy for half the plant output to December (R$24 
million per month) and expand the diesel coverage to the whole plant through 
Furnas, where Furnas would pay for the diesel in the other half of the power 
plant another R$24 million per month). I will have to negotiate a Contract 
Amendment,

Jose

Jose:

I have learnt from the RAC meeting today that a DASH for $128.4 million for 
additional cost over-runs will be put in front of the Board Monday 30th.  I 
am sure that you are involved in this specific issue, but I am erring on the 
conservative side.  Is there any regulatory issue that we should raise or 
point out from this end (e.g., whether the regulatory regimen allows these 
cost over-runs to be rolled into the rate base, hence the revenue 
requirement,or not).  

Of course, let me know if I could be of any help, or you need a follow up 
action from Houston side.

FYI

May be I was too assertive in the press criticizing the stupidity of revoking 
Annex V and setting caps on spot.  Mr. Mauro Arce got upset, but he realized 
that his proposal to change the rules would face strong opposition, with 
solid arguments. 

In my simple view, he realized that not everyone would stay quiet.

Let's see.

Maurer,

Sorry, I forgot to copy you.
My opinion is that with this presentation and your  letter we are ready to go 
to Pedro Parente.

By the way:
Two non official news, but from reliable sources ( Assad and Fred) ;

NO CAP, MAE PRICE WILL BE 684 REAIS ( COST OF DEFICIT), announced by Mauro 
Arce
SUB-MARKET LIMITS BETWEEN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST WILL BE SAME USED BY ONS. No 
more Encargos de Servi?os do Sistema being artificially created ( this was a 
condition precedent in our/Abradee's proposal). Fred has the resolution draft.

Let's wait to see the measures published, and celebrate these to small 
victories latter. The big one is Anex V.

Rick

As you know, the energy sector is facing several challenges: MAE 
intervention, rationing, drafting a new market agreement and the like. It is 
all happening as we speak.

In my capacity of President of the Brazilian Association of Energy Traders, I 
have defended correct economic  signals, have a functioning MAE, keeping 
market rules stable, creating wholesale and retail competition, honoring 
contract sanctity, and the like. More importantly, that rationing should not 
be an excuse for "revoking" supply and demand

Those are not ideologic positions only. They represent, in my view, the best 
interest for Enron in the short, medium and long terms.  We have already 
agreed on that in a recent Enron executive commitee. That means, I am in fact 
wearing Abraceel hat to defend Enron's best interests.

Just two examples on how those principles are linked to our interest (among 
many others)

a) By defending contract sanctity, we defended Elektro's contractual position 
on Annex V, which sets a formula on how financial contracts  decline during 
rationing. Simulations have indicated that our long position, even during the 
deepest rationing will offset loss of revenues. On the contraty, w/o Annex V 
loss of EBITDA may be US$ 60 million in 2001

b) By defending the integrity of MAE, spot prices and the like, we are paving 
the road for Eletrobolt's success.

Needless to say, Abraceel message has been  consistent "across the board". 
For example, if one believes on markets, we have to defend the use of market 
signals (economic incentives/penalties) during rationing. And prices to 
allocate a scarce resource. Also, as a corollary, no intervention in spot 
prices, which will, in turn, make our Eletrobolt merchant plant feasible.

I feel very comfortable in defending Enron's interests and wearing my 
Abraceel hat. There is a positive synergy.

However, Orlando is the President of ABRADEE, the Brazilian Association of 
Distributors. The interests of ABRADEE are not always the interests of free 
market (seldom are); nor they are the interests of Enron. For example, 
ABRADEE as a group, criticizes the government for changing MAE governance; 
they wanted rolling black-outs instead of economic signals; they advocate 
caps on spot and the like. 

Needless to say, there is a [potential] crash here, with some internal 
reverberations.

Today,  the government announced the  rationing plan. It is based on quotas 
with an overlay of economic signals (tied to wholesale prices). This is 
consistent with markets and what ABRACEEL has been saying on and on. However, 
ABRADEE wanted rolling black-outs.  (paving the road for eliminating MAE 
rules and setting caps on spot to avoid exposures)

Guess what happened? Orlando is being pressured by his peers to criticize the 
plan and kill it. I am convinced that the government made the right decision 
(and we helped influence it)

The subject has received a lot of press coverage on TV, radio and other 
media. Abraceel has been viewed as one of the champions of market forces. 
Last Tuesday, I was invited to express our views to the "Minister of the 
Rationing" and I think I was quite persuasive in showing that there is 
elasticity in demand, MAE should work asap, intervention was necessary, 
government should refrain from the temptation to set caps on spot, etc. Most 
of those statements where contrary to what Abradee had stated in the very 
same meeting. The plan the Government announced today embeds several elements 
of market forces. It was a sudden shift from the plan announced a few days 
ago, where market signals were completely neglected. (CERA has recently 
referred to it as a "step away from market forces"). And it was indeed.

Internally, we have been managing this tension in a productive way for Enron. 
However, the situation is getting more complicated, as tension increases. 
Orlando is getting a little uncomfortable because his peers perceive Luiz 
Maurer as someone against the interest of the distribution business.

In sum, there is an internal issue going on. I do not want to be a trouble 
maker. However, I feel that we have now a window of opportunities to make 
things work. (or at least to try to) Our relationship with ANEEL and with the 
powerful Ministry of Rationing has been excellent. I feel we should take 
advantage of it and put a stick on the ground. That is our culture. 

 I think that spending too much time and energy in building consensus among 
different stakeholders is not going to lead us anywhere (beside, we know that 
we do not want markets). That is what we have been doing at COEX in the last 
two years, with no material results. We have remained silent in key issues 
waiting for this consensus to happen. This has been the case for the market 
intervention. The market is misinterpreting our views. For example, there was 
a  press article today, stating that Enron, together with AES, were 
dominating COEX and are trying to revert the situation back to the old regime 
(stakeholder board). What a gross misinterpretation of our views !! 
Informativo Regulatorio #  3 has conveyed  the opposite message and it has 
inspired ANEEL to start fixing the mess !! They gave us the credit. We are 
still silent on our view, waiting for  consensus to happen. 

May be I am in too much of a hurry, because I am leaving soon. But I feel 
that we have a window of opportunity to make things happen (or at least 
knowing that they are not going to happen any time soon). And we are not 
taking advantage of it.

I am not expecting any immediate action from you. Just for you to be aware on 
what is going on and  share some concerns.  If you have any comments or any  
advise, please let me know.  I have even considered to resign Abraceel 
leadership to avoid future internal conflicts.

I was asked to keep my mouth shut. 

But I am still looking forward  to celebrating 5 victories in a row

1) Itaipu excess energy belonging to D/Rs
2) Changing MAE governance
3) Quotas with economic signals as opposed to rolling black-outs
4) No changes in Annex V
5) No caps on spot prices

Decisions on the last two ones should be made shortly. 

I may have left some enemies behind, but I leave with the sense of having 
fulfilled my mission.

Subject: Re: Renunciando a ABRACEEL  

Luiz. After consideration of currents events we believe this in an opportune 
moment for you to resign as President of Abraceel and turn over the reigns to 
your successor.  

Two reasons.  First,  the President's position in Abraceel is one that you 
could not fill from Houston and given your imminent departure you need time 
to advise your Board and plan for an orderly transition; secondly, as 
President of Abraceel, you are called by the press to make public statements 
to defend the position of power marketers in general. This is why we wanted 
you in that role in the first place, but due to the current circumstances 
that has become a temporary liability.

When you speak to the Press, you are mostly identified by the informed sector 
leaders as Enron, no matter how thoroughly you try to clarify that  you are 
speaking as President of Abraceel. In the meantime,  Orlando is in the middle 
of intensive negotiations with the government members and some of your recent 
comments have been untimely, in that it makes it appear, in public, that the 
Crisis Management Group issue leader, in insensitive to the power marketers 
(read Enron) position, thus undercutting his leverage. That also puts you in 
an awkward position, because as President of the organization you are not 
serving the membership by not engaging in the public debate.

But this does not mean that you are not still fully engaged in the battle!. 
Your prediction that the "policy makers" are taking decisions that will hurt 
the market may come true, and if so, we Enron, will come out fighting.  

In the mean time,  we will be needing your background and knowledge to move 
our viewpoints through the open doors that have been presented to us in the 
negotiations. 

Rick Shapiro has committed your assistance to the region as long as it is 
needed. Joe and Orlando would have wished that the clock could be stopped and 
you physical departure be postponed. But they are well aware that it is not 
fair to you and your family to postpone the move. We will work something out

As per Sergio's and Rick's request, please find enclosed a quick summary on 
the ANEEL's  "intervention" in the MAE.

This note is organized in four main sections:

a) What was it?
b) Initial reactions
c) Enron's view
d) Next steps


a) WHAT WAS IT?

 Aneel has recently issued a series of three Resolutions (160/161/162) 
significantly changing the structure and governance of MAE. It has also 
amended some of the MAE rules regarding penalties and guarantees on financial 
settlement.

 In terms of structure, ANEEL has empowered ASMAE to develop its 
responsibilities. ASMAE  is the organization in charge of developing MAE's 
basic operational functions, such as metering, contract registering, spot 
price calculation and financial settlement. It also has a role in developing 
the MAE rules, an effort which started in November 1998 and has not yet come 
to fruition. ASMAE formerly reported to COEX, the MAE Board of Directors, 
According to the recently enacted Resolution ASMAE will have now a solid line 
relationship with ANEEL and it was empowered to develop it basic 
organizational functions more independently from the Board of Directors.

 In terms of governance, ANEEL has terminated COEX, a 26 stakeholder Board in 
charge or runinng MAE and preparing the MAE rules. The Resolution was 
effective immediately. In lieu of COEX, ANEEL has created COMAE, a new 6 
member professional  Board, in charge of overseeing ASMAE and developing MAE 
rules, on an ongoing basis. COMAE should be operational in two months.  
ANEEL,Distributors and Generators should appoint two voting members each. 
Similarly to COEX, COMAE will still report to the MAE General Assembly, where 
all stakeholdershave a seat (votes are equally split between generators and 
distributors)

 In terms of MAE rules, ANEEL has now imposed penalties and guarantees. Those 
were part of the MAE rules since the very beginning, but they have never been 
implemented. The original MAE rules encompassed a broader range of penalties. 
ANEEL has focused solely on the the penalties of financial nature, the ones 
strictly necessary to have the financial settlement up and running.

 There is a 60 day period to put the new organization and governance in 
place. In the meantime, ASMAE will continue its routine functions. If doubts 
arise, ASMAE will clarify directly with ANEEL 


b) INITIAL REACTIONS

 Most companies were shocked with the new Resolutions. The Resolutions were 
issued on a Friday, late afternoon, to allow agents to dissipate their anger 
over the weekend. The measures were considered a unilateral "coup-de-etat"  
kind of intervention. A lot of criticism was raised on the "legality" of the 
process. Initial reactions challenged ANEEL's ability to intervene in the MAE 
rules and terminate COEX.

 Similar reactions were expressed the following week. A COEX meeting (void in 
legal terms) was held the following week to verbalize people's angers and 
discuss next steps. An immediate General Assembly was scheduled. Several COEX 
members got really upset. Reasons vary: some are questioning the necessity of 
those actions, although most agree that COEX was not a functioning organic 
body. Some COEX member got very emotional: afterall, their hierarchical 
positions inside their organizations depend on the status granted  by being a 
COEX member.  

 ANEEL invited CEOs from all affiliated companies to explain the rationale 
behind those measures and avoid direct confrontation with COEX, whose members 
are motivated by more parochial views. The meeting was useful and most of the 
negative reaction was placated.

 No one is now is now considering any legal action against ANEEL. Most 
stakeholders agree that something had to be done, despite the fact that the 
way ANEEL invervened was disastrous and with doubtful legal validity. The 
issue now is to prepare a new Market Agreement, containing the basic mandates 
and addressing utility's concerns.


c) Enron's view

 Enron thinks that the proposed changes were badly needed. Enron has publicly 
and in several occasions expressed its view about COEX role in MAE 
implementation. In Informativo Regulat?rio # 3, issued back in November 2000, 
we blamed the stakeholder nature of COEX for most of MAE problems. Nothing 
was being decided. COEX attempted to get the MAE rules in place for more than 
two years without success. No one (except a few, including Enron) was 
interested in getting MAE up and running. Rather, most agents were interested 
in conforming the MAE rules to meet their ad-hoc individual parochial 
interests. The COEX attempt to deal with the nuclear issue was a clear na<ve, 
retreat to objectives. Procrastination was the rule of the game. In sum, COEX 
was not working. The California experience served to surface and enlighten 
the maladies of stakeholder's Board. In several instances, we proposed a 
professional Board and some form of ANEEL's intervention, as it had the 
ultimate responsibility to have a functioning market. R

 ANEEL has reportedly taking our comments into account. Regulatory Affairs 
is  proud to have influenced  this process. However, we think ANEEL should 
have acted a long time ago. ANEEL now has a sense of urgency. It fully 
understands that a non-functioning market would be an obstacle to anyone's  
building new short term generation, on a merchant basis. This incremental 
generation is key to mitigate the impact of rationing. 

  No one doubts that ANEELs intervention was a "coup-de-etat". Legally 
speaking, it is also questionable. ANEEL is backed by the Ministry of Energy 
and by other Federally owned generations, who have many votes in the MAE. 
Despite those deficiencies,  we believe the changes are in the right 
direction.

 ANEEL has called Enron and asked for our  individual support as well as to 
use our influence in the coalitions groups we are part of (ABRADEE, APINE, 
CBIEE and ABRACEEL), to help mitigate the anger and help get the new Market 
Agreement in place. Apparently ANEEL did not call any other private utility. 
We explained ANEEL how delicate the situation is. The only way to proceed is 
to shift the spotlight from the legal issues and try to focus on a new MAE 
Agreement, to be signed by all parties. This would require ANEEL some 
willingness to negotiate and compromise. They accepted our suggestion. We 
have also expressed our view that ANEEL should not further interfere in the 
MAE rules, spot pricing and contracts. Our support is contingent on the 
integrity of market and contracts, even during a serious rationing. The 
impending rationing indeed represents a temptation for the regulator to 
further interfere, set caps on spot and the like.

 We have focused most of our effort in examining the three Resolutions and 
proposing changes & improvements to be incorporated into a new MAE Agreement. 
There are many aspects which need to be clarified/improved in the new 
governance and structure as proposed by ANEEL. For example, the hierarchical 
lines between ANEEL, COMAE, ANEEL, General Assembly and Board of ASMAE need 
clarification. Similarly, the penalty rules need a lot of work to be ready to 
be implemented.

 We have prepared several suggestions and we have circulated among industry 
players, asking for inputs and feedback. No one is really focused on the new 
MAE Agreement. Discussions are still very emotional at this point in time. 
However, we feel that some progress has been made. Coalition groups  are not 
talking about challenging the Resolution on legal grounds. This is unlikely 
to happen on an individual basis. The situation is relatively  under control.

d) Next Steps
 
 Despite the progress in mitigating the initial anger, there is still a long 
way to go. Our initial recommendations to improve the Resolutions, 
distributed to industry players, should be technically discussed and agreed. 
COMAE members should be appointed: ideally, utilities should agree on the 
COMAE members specs, on a slate of candidates and on a process for final 
COMAE members selection. Finally, a new MAE Agreement should be signed. None 
of them are trivial tasks from a political standpoint.  ANEEL has established 
a 60 day transitional period and a safety net if nothing happens: ANEEL 
itself would choose the members and will maintain the Resolutions as they 
are. 

 We are also going to use ABRACEEL to lobby for COMAE seats (one or two) to 
be appointed by traders. So far, this group has not been represented in the 
COEX and in any other MAE formal or informal discussion groups.  We feel 
traders are handicaped and that this is detrimental to the market as a whole 
Distributors avoid retail competition while generators avoid wholesale 
compatition. Collectively, they avoid competition and therefore the 
implementation of the market. Traders are the only ones who strongly advocate 
competition, on a genuine basis.

 All of this will keep Regulatory Affairs busy for the next months.

Gentlemen:

Here is the revised letter with the appendices. It incorporate all the 
comments received in the last 24 hours. The other two documents are of public 
domain and should be attached to the leter.
The letter has a kind of executive summary, as requested by Orlando/Sergio. 
Thanks for the good comments from Legal (Sami) and TRM (David).



Again, I feel that time is of the essence. 

We need to express our views to the Minister before Mario Arce comes up with 
a final proposal (he has already a pre-cooked one)

I think it's a great idea, Luiz.  How about a paper organized around Remi's 
four points with you developing the arguments (such as the argument for 
contract sanctity included in this e-mail chain).  Perhaps Orlando and / or 
Kish could get a meeting with Parente to present the paper and explain how it 
is a comprehensive roadmap to permanently reslove the problem.

I think it is a good idea to state our position on Annex V and to take this 
chance to reaffirm our belief in the following 4 basic principles:

1. Contract sanctity (Annex V holds, all contracts hold)
2. No caps on spot prices (if Brazil still wants to attract private funds in 
new generation)
3. Pass through of MAE price at LDC level for end-user consumption above 
their respective quota
4. Brazil needs MAE to settle: make it work.  Only way: reinforce credit 
worthiness of all MAE members.

Subject: ASMAE taking the [wrong] view on Annex X - Ignorance or bad faith?


Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time  ASMAE 
employee) was expressing her [distorted] views  to the press on why 
generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on 
behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view. 

I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from 
expressing an opposite opinion.

There are two problems in Patricia's view:

1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only 
settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract 
disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's 
frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6 
months.  Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail.

2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments. 



A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally, 
as you see fit)

1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts.
 * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as 
CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other 
agreements should not abide by their clauses?

2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions
 * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement 
without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion 
contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement 
provisions? Guess what the answer was? None

3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed 
Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98)
 *  This is serious
 *  That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not 
want to abide by Law? No response

4) Some companies do not have Annex V
 * So what? Discussion is about Annex V
 * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts

6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the 
Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk 
represented by Annex V
 *  So what?
 *  Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have 
regulated prices.
 *  Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V 
risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a 
windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors)

7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to 
mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch
 * Wrong
 *  ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place 
to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool 
operation
 *  Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called "dry 
period relief" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by 
Annel. The spot price is a "proxy" for the depth of rationing. One should not 
evoke rationing.


I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is 
"bullet proof". In the meantime, let me share my views:

 * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on 
the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should 
collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make 
this clear at the outset. 

 *  We should make Minister Patente realize  that Mario Arce's proposal is 
non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices  is 
a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known 
risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and 
Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) .  If we do want to create a 
market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting 
should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a 
poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that 
irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on 
spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts 
will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and 
worse.

 *  Generators should have the burden of proof.  In the meantime, Annex V is 
effective and should be enforceable

 * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally 
different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In 
Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could 
also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted 
irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in 
expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex 
V. 

 *  The argument "no one should lose, no one should gain" during rationing is 
inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain 
by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a 
great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously. 
Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market.

 *  We have to be as transparent as possible.

Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V 
and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week. 

I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea.

LM

I strongly disagree

"If it is impossible to reach an agreement within ABRADEE",, then we should 
be loud an clear in expressing our own view, to all levels of government 
including a position paper to  Pedro Parente asap.  Caps at this point in 
time may jeopardize the rationing plan per se. We had a victory in anchoring 
the penalties to the MAE price. Why surrender it now? 

Why do we have to abide by ABRADEE's desires? 

This is not a religious issue only.  There are a few US$ million left on the 
table.

How many US$ million are on the table for Enron?

 - Ballpark, possibly  US$20f or Elektro's long position  (60 in EBITDA * 
(680-460)/680)
 - A lot, lot more for Eletrobolt (perhaps to the point of killing the 
project, as Joao Albuquerque stated)

Are we being consistent? About a week ago, we submitted our views to ANEEL, 
on Public Hearing 02/2001, advocating for an increase in the cost of defict 
to US$ 2350/MWh. The trading group (Remi, David) were adamant about this 
position submitted by Regulatory Affairs (I think they are right) 

Are we acting to the best interest of our shareholders?

 - N?O PODE SER INFERIOR AO PRE_O PRATICADO NO PRE-RACIONAMENTO ( R$ 460,00 )
 - N?O PODE SER INFERIOR ? MAIOR TARIFA COBRADA DOS CONSUMIDORES  ( TROS 
VEZES A TARIFA RESIDENCIAL  ATUAL - 200% SOBRE A MESMA, PARA CONSUMOS ACIMA 
DE 500 KWh POR MOS) . 

Mazzon, calcule a ordem de grandeza deste valor. _ importante termos isto em 
mente quando formos falar com as autoridades amanh? e, em especial com Mauro 
Arce.

Lembrar, ainda, que um CAP baixo, sem FLOOR, pode matar ELETROBOLT, uma vez 
que as receitas que esta auferiria em 2002 n?o compensariam o decr,scimo das 
mesmas de 2003 em diante, quando, com a redu??o de mercado devido ao 
racionamento e o aumento de entrada de novas fontes de gera??o, tamb,m 
incentivada pelo racionamento, poder? derrubar fortemente os pre?os do MAE. 
N?o devemos nos esquecer que o per?odo de amortiza??o de ELETROBOLT , de 
cinco anos.

Growing Legal Problems for Energy Rationing Program
The legal battle provoked by the government =01,s energy rationing program
intensified Thursday with a S?o Paulo judge throwing out the program =01,s
penalties.
Thursday night,a judge in the city of Mar?lia,S?o Paulo issued an injunctio=

One more fyi. 

I prepared this letter as per top management request. Enron needs to make it 
clear what our view is on caps, Annex V, fixing MAE, etc.

Luiz,

Generally an excellent job.  

I would make a stronger point of the fact that many technical experts (us 
included) believe that cost-of-defecit should be multi-tiered, and that even 
the first tier should be higher.  I also wouldn't concede that changing the 
cost of defecit is a change of the rules.  Nevertheless, leaving it where it 
is probably the best compromise between true market incentives and political 
pressures.

I would also strengthen the arguments supporting the MAE: e.g. there is no 
substitute for an efficient central clearing mechanism with accurate price 
signals, credit integrity, and timely cash settlement.  I WOULD NOT make the 
resolution of Angra II a pre-condition for the continuing well-being of the 
MAE.   Let's just get the market working now (e.g. governance, 
penalties/guaranties, accounting) on an ongoing basis; I think that the issue 
of Angra II can be treated separately.

Given the current discussion vis-a-vis the constitutionality of ammending the 
Consumer Protection Code by executive fiat, I agree with your decision to 
avoid the discussion of pass-throughs.

I think it's a great idea, Luiz.  How about a paper organized around Remi's 
four points with you developing the arguments (such as the argument for 
contract sanctity included in this e-mail chain).  Perhaps Orlando and / or 
Kish could get a meeting with Parente to present the paper and explain how it 
is a comprehensive roadmap to permanently reslove the problem.

I think it is a good idea to state our position on Annex V and to take this 
chance to reaffirm our belief in the following 4 basic principles:

1. Contract sanctity (Annex V holds, all contracts hold)
2. No caps on spot prices (if Brazil still wants to attract private funds in 
new generation)
3. Pass through of MAE price at LDC level for end-user consumption above 
their respective quota
4. Brazil needs MAE to settle: make it work.  Only way: reinforce credit 
worthiness of all MAE members.

Subject: ASMAE taking the [wrong] view on Annex X - Ignorance or bad faith?


Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time  ASMAE 
employee) was expressing her [distorted] views  to the press on why 
generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on 
behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view. 

I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from 
expressing an opposite opinion.

There are two problems in Patricia's view:

1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only 
settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract 
disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's 
frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6 
months.  Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail.

2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments. 



A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally, 
as you see fit)

1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts.
 * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as 
CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other 
agreements should not abide by their clauses?

2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions
 * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement 
without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion 
contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement 
provisions? Guess what the answer was? None

3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed 
Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98)
 *  This is serious
 *  That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not 
want to abide by Law? No response

4) Some companies do not have Annex V
 * So what? Discussion is about Annex V
 * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts

6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the 
Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk 
represented by Annex V
 *  So what?
 *  Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have 
regulated prices.
 *  Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V 
risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a 
windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors)

7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to 
mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch
 * Wrong
 *  ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place 
to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool 
operation
 *  Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called "dry 
period relief" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by 
Annel. The spot price is a "proxy" for the depth of rationing. One should not 
evoke rationing.


I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is 
"bullet proof". In the meantime, let me share my views:

 * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on 
the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should 
collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make 
this clear at the outset. 

 *  We should make Minister Patente realize  that Mario Arce's proposal is 
non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices  is 
a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known 
risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and 
Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) .  If we do want to create a 
market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting 
should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a 
poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that 
irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on 
spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts 
will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and 
worse.

 *  Generators should have the burden of proof.  In the meantime, Annex V is 
effective and should be enforceable

 * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally 
different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In 
Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could 
also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted 
irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in 
expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex 
V. 

 *  The argument "no one should lose, no one should gain" during rationing is 
inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain 
by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a 
great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously. 
Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market.

 *  We have to be as transparent as possible.

Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V 
and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week. 

I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea.

LM

AES Suspends Brazil Investments
US-based power company AES Corp. has put on hold plans to invest between
US$2 billion and US$2.5 billion on energy projects in Brazil, alleging that=
=20
the
government=01,s policy on pricing is jeopardizing its operations.
AES President Dennis Bakke, on a brief visit to Brazil, said the company
suspended indefinitely its plans to build as many as 10 thermoelectric powe=
r
plants.
Bakke criticized Brazil's electricity sector regulator Aneel for maintainin=
g=20
an
energy policy that charged what Bakke said were ``unrealistically low price=
s=20
for
consumers,'' forcing AES to carry the burden of rising costs.
He said investments would remain on hold until the government came up with
a solution.
AES has already invested US$6 billion in Brazil, primarily in electricity
projects, making it one of the country's top private foreign investors.

Energy Blackouts To Begin June 1
The government announced Tuesday that it will begin a policy of programmed
blackouts starting June 1 as part of its energy rationing plan.
Mines and Energy Ministry officials had at first hoped to delay any blackou=
ts
until August, concentrating first on a program to induce consumers to reduc=
e
energy use. The critical level of reservoirs in the country=01,s main=20
hydroelectric
plants, however, forced Tuesday=01,s decision to accelerate the blackouts w=
hich=20
will
last until the end of November when the rainy season begins.
The blackouts will occur in the Southeast, Central-West and Northeast regio=
ns
of the country. At the same time the government will introduce a program=20
providing
incentives to consumers to reduce their energy use. The goal of the plan is=
=20
to lower
electricity consumption by 20%.
Although the general outline of the rationing plan was announced Tuesday, t=
he
details have yet to be worked out due to differences between the government
ministers who compose the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE). A new
meeting of CNPE was set for May 23 by which time it is hoped that an agreem=
ent
will have been reached on how to implement the plan.
The initial proposal from Mines and Energy was for a 15% reduction for
industry, 20% for residences and between 18% and 20% for commerce. The
ministries of finance, planning and development, however, asked for more ti=
me=20
to
consider the impact of the energy cuts.
The principal concern among government officials is with the impact on the
economy of the proposed blackouts. According to a study to be released toda=
y=20
by
the Get?lio Vargas Foundation, a 20% energy cut would slow economic growth =
by
1.5% of gross domestic product and would have a direct impact on 850,000 jo=
bs.
Production costs for industry would rise 1.5%, government tax receipts woul=
d
decline by R$6.6 billion (US$2.9 billion) and Brazil=01,s trade deficit wou=
ld=20
increase
by US$1.6 billion, according to the study. The study=01,s authors also said=
=20
there was
no guarantee that the effects of the program would be limited to this year.
Business leaders reacted with apprehension to the prospect of obligatory
blackouts. Most defended a policy of separate reduction goals for each=20
industrial
sector, sparing industries that depend heavily on electricity. The S?o Paul=
o=20
State
Federation of Industries (Fiesp) said that sectors who are major consumers =
of
energy such as steel should be exempted from any rationing.
While details were lacking in the government=01,s plan, officials said that=
 the
administration of the energy cuts would be placed in the hands of local=20
utilities
which would determine the locations and schedules for daily blackouts.=20
According
to national energy secretary Afonso Henriques, a 20% reduction in consumpti=

would amount to a cut of six hours a day.

Jo?o

Congratulations for you enlightening participation at todays' meeting with 
generators to rebuff Annex V arguments.

For the first time in two years I have seen the "underdogs" distributors 
beating the powerful generators.  The performance reminded me the Brazil 4 x 
Italy 1, June 21, 1970 final world cup soccer match. Let's not give up.

Joao

I know we are all in the same boat. We share the same ideas as well. The only 
difference is perhaps the approach.

I am kind of skeptical of negotiating with those guys. COEX has been a two 
year failure in terms of consensus building. Where has consensus led us? 
Nowhere. After some point, it is worthless discussing with those guys. (I 
know that you have been standing and fighting) 

You are  probably right when  you say I am being radical . Given my 
skepticism, I think there are only two ways: (i) going straight to Pedro 
Parente (ii) or, a big splash in the media. (because we have a coherent 
story, there are always many reporters willing to listen to us; I think we 
should not be afraid of putting a stick on the ground, as necessary)

I know that Mario Arce got upset with me and I did not mean it. However, he 
has to know that if he comes up with some "pre-cooked" crazy ideas (Kill 
Annex V,  caps on spot) he will have to face the "discipline" of the media.  
He (or any other) has to know that we will do whatever is necessary to get 
our ideas across. It is a war. No time for consensus building or for being 
the nice guy. They are writing new laws as we speak. There is a strong sense 
of urgency. It is a make it or break it situation.

This is my modest view only.

David and Luiz,

Please don't be radical and don't  put words when you do not know  what is 
going on.
Some important players and people are supporting a very low cap: some 320 
reais or even less (320 is in one of the Generators proposal).  
I was the one fighting in all meetings  I had, last and this week, standing 
up in front of everybody, supporting NO CAP AT ALL.
What I tried to share with you was a second line of defence Plan B  type.
So don't think you are the only paladins of the market. We are fighting hard 
for ENRON's positions, in the real word, and working very hard, believe me.

thanks,

Jo?o Carlos

Got the info late, but...

I also can not see how we can even consider supporting price caps.  If they 
come, they come.  Politica are a reality.  But we should not support them or 
even hint at encouraging them.  If we are thinking about doing so, please let 
me know because I strongly object.

Thanks,

Kish

Luiz,

Thanks again for maintaining a voice of sanity.  

In my not so humble opinion, it is commercial suicide for us to even give the 
appearance of supporting price caps.  I can't think of any other situation 
anywhere in the world where Enron has supported price caps in a market.  To 
the contrary, we are almost always public in our opposition to such 
market-killing sophistry.

Consensus is a noble objective, but sometimes it is just better to let people 
know your true opinion.

I strongly disagree

"If it is impossible to reach an agreement within ABRADEE",, then we should 
be loud an clear in expressing our own view, to all levels of government 
including a position paper to  Pedro Parente asap.  Caps at this point in 
time may jeopardize the rationing plan per se. We had a victory in anchoring 
the penalties to the MAE price. Why surrender it now? 

Why do we have to abide by ABRADEE's desires? 

This is not a religious issue only.  There are a few US$ million left on the 
table.

How many US$ million are on the table for Enron?

 - Ballpark, possibly  US$20f or Elektro's long position  (60 in EBITDA * 
(680-460)/680)
 - A lot, lot more for Eletrobolt (perhaps to the point of killing the 
project, as Joao Albuquerque stated)

Are we being consistent? About a week ago, we submitted our views to ANEEL, 
on Public Hearing 02/2001, advocating for an increase in the cost of defict 
to US$ 2350/MWh. The trading group (Remi, David) were adamant about this 
position submitted by Regulatory Affairs (I think they are right) 

Are we acting to the best interest of our shareholders?

Subject: CAP no MAE

Algumas empresas de distribui??o short em 02 e 03 est?o defendendo fortememte 
CAP no MAE,  bem abaixo do custo do d,ficit ( cerca de R$ 680). ( CERJ, 
Cataguases, LIght est? em cima do muro, etc...)

Se for inevit?vel, nossa posi??o deve ser:

 - N?O PODE SER INFERIOR AO PRE_O PRATICADO NO PRE-RACIONAMENTO ( R$ 460,00 )
 - N?O PODE SER INFERIOR ? MAIOR TARIFA COBRADA DOS CONSUMIDORES  ( TROS 
VEZES A TARIFA RESIDENCIAL  ATUAL - 200% SOBRE A MESMA, PARA CONSUMOS ACIMA 
DE 500 KWh POR MOS) . 

Mazzon, calcule a ordem de grandeza deste valor. _ importante termos isto em 
mente quando formos falar com as autoridades amanh? e, em especial com Mauro 
Arce.

Lembrar, ainda, que um CAP baixo, sem FLOOR, pode matar ELETROBOLT, uma vez 
que as receitas que esta auferiria em 2002 n?o compensariam o decr,scimo das 
mesmas de 2003 em diante, quando, com a redu??o de mercado devido ao 
racionamento e o aumento de entrada de novas fontes de gera??o, tamb,m 
incentivada pelo racionamento, poder? derrubar fortemente os pre?os do MAE. 
N?o devemos nos esquecer que o per?odo de amortiza??o de ELETROBOLT , de 
cinco anos.
