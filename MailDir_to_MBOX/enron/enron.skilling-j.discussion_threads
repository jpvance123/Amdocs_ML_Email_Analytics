A police officer pulls a guy over for speeding and has the following  
exchange:
Officer:
May I see your driver's  license?
Driver:
I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got my  5th DUI.
Officer:
May I see the owner's card for this  vehicle?
Driver:
It's not my car. I stole it.
Officer:
The  car is stolen?
Driver:
That's right. But come to think of it, I think  I saw the owner's card
in the glove box when I was putting my gun in  there.
Officer:
There's a gun in the glove box?
Driver:
Yes  sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who
owns this  car and stuffed her in the trunk.
Officer:
There's a BODY in the  TRUNK?!?!?
Driver:
Yes, sir.
Hearing this, the officer  immediately called his captain. The car was
quickly surrounded by police, and  the captain approached the driver
to handle the tense  situation:
Captain:
Sir, can I see your  license?
Driver:
Sure. Here it is.
It was  valid.
Captain:
Who's car is this?
Driver:
It's mine,  officer. Here's the owner' card.
The driver owned the  car.
Captain:
Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if  there's a gun 
in it?
Driver:
Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.
Sure  enough, there was nothing in the glove box.
Captain:
Would you mind  opening your trunk? I was told you said there's body in it.
Driver:
No  problem.
Trunk is opened; no body.
Captain:
I don't understand  it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you
didn't have a license,  stole the car, had a gun in the glove box, and that
there was a dead body in  the trunk.
Driver:
Yeah, I'll bet the liar told you I was speeding,  too!

Mark;  Thanks for pointing out my dumb mistake.  I apparently hit an extra
key. It should be (630 466-0442).  It will show in the phone book under your

Jeff,

After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric 
Broadband (DCB). 

1. The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Conroe 
Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholder and 
is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, whom you 
met recently at the YPO gathering. 

2. DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cities 
in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a strategy 
to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market they are in 
requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in a city is 
critical to success.

3. We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone 
Investors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to 
participate with us in any future investments we make in DCB.

4. We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however he 
made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not interested 
in the investment.

5. DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for 
continued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential 
investors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.

6. About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pacific 
Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to $75 
million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial investment 
of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a similar 
amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wireless 
access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice if EBS 
would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction with U P or 
on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a strategic 
fit to their business model and would be interested in a much closer 
relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and  DCB 
are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has used DCB 
to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.)  Ken's 
response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB and he 
didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.  

7. We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about 
investments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing 
funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's 
commitment.

8.  At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any 
additional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from 
ourselves since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this 
investment.  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic 
potential of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving 
forward in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are 
currently in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal 
structure by the end of May.

  We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way while 
making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a space that 
could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we could work 
together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit with DCB.  We 
will continue to develop relationships with other strategic and financial 
partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investment in DCB.

 I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We 
will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we make 
in DCB.  Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Gene

Hi Jeff:

Survived my trip back and a week alone with the kiddies while Nina was out
at her conference in Corsica.  Just got notified that the first film I sent
off to shutterfly is available.  There are some really great photos from the
wedding day.  I'm sending you the link (by separate email)  if you're
interested and will make copies of the likely photos for you and rebecca
once I've gotten all the rolls processed.  If you see any in particular that
you like, let me know and I'll get copies made of those too.  (There's a
really good one of the two of you with Shukran!)

I really enjoyed hanging out with both of you and am looking forward to
seeing you one of these days in SF.  I don't have rebecca's email.  Please
sent her my love.

All the best!

--Misha Weidman
Chili-Up!

Amelia-
I am selling the bike I rode in the MS150.  I bought to ride in the MS, so it 
has very little miles on it.  It is a Trek 420 with all the ammenities needed 
on a bike.  I have a speedometer, air pump, gel seat, and a water bottle 
holder.  I'm asking for $500 obo.    Can you please forward this message to 
the club members?  

Thanks,
Petual

?
Rob Rossell and his brother Bill have  come through.? It's gunna be Lakewood  
Landing.? For a little insurance and your piece of mind, we  sent Tom Benson 
on a little reconnaissance mission.? His report  below:
?
"Yeah - I went by there.? Definitely our kind of place.  Looks like we can 
get as rowdy as we want.? They have got burgers, booze  and pool.? Plenty big

its not like we were 19 year olds, just a bunch of  40 somethings who still 
think they are 19 year olds!"
?
They feature a variety of barley brews, Rock 'n Rye and Haig & Haig,  but no 
Zodiac yet.
?
Many clicks to Rob and Tom.

Dear Jeff,

Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke
when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent
Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last
year.

I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company
composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth
of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am
looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The
commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in
the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola
and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan.

Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet
access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the
latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide
network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate
of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at
www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date
with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas
Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners.

Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to
speaking with you and catching up.

Sincerely,

Dave Schaeffer, CEO

Have been in Antakya for the last couple days.  Will leave tomorrow.  Might
spend a night in Iskenderun on the coast, or might head back to Istanbul via
Ankara (where I hope to spend a day) by train.

Antakya formally named Antioch, of great import to Christian history.  (If
you look on  a map, I'm in the that finger of land that extends down from
Turkey between Syria and the Mediterranean.)  Not much in the town of great
beauty; mostly just modern, cement based, instantly aged, utilitarian styled
buildings.  Things stitched together, rickety, somewhat polluted.  The town,
however, surrounded by impressive mountains.  Have met a young Arab man, who
has shown me around (saw some spectacular thousand year old ruins (build by
Christians; destroyed by Muslims) on top of a mountain not far from here,
from which vantage point we could look out over the Mediterranean (and a
setting sun) and also to the south at a snow capped mountain that stood
between us and nearby Syria).  Last night joined him and his friends.  We
ate this heavenly kebab wrapped in thin, fried (in olive oil) unleaven bread
(the whole thing called Durum), then I watched as they played a card game
akin to Bridge.  (Did you know that Bridge was invented in Istanbul some 150
years ago by a few British soldiers stationed there during the Crimean War?
The name came from the fact they crossed the Galata Bridge [not far from my
place] each evening.  [Florence Nightingale (sp?) also stationed in Istanbul
during that same war, which was when she made her name.]) Two of the players
were Christian, one was Turk and the fourth my "new" Arab friend.  This
provence, Hatay, is apparently the most diverse one here in Turkey, in an
ethnic, cultural, religious sense.

Boat ride over from Cyprus an ordeal.  Seas rough.  Took twice as long (4
hours instead of 2) as advertized.  I got worried when the stewards passed
out small plastic bags as we left port.  I lasted about an hour and a half
before I used mine, but was part of a vast majority of fellow suffers.  I
guess I didn't inherent sea legs for my old man.

More later,

Love,

Mark

Jeffrey,

We all have so much to thank God for! My wife and I will be away this coming 
week and so permit me to now take this opportunity to wish you and yours a 
truly great Thanksgiving holiday!

Our predictive dialer has evolved into a world-class computer-telephony 
server. Users may now easily add advanced inbound and call blending 
functionality, voice monitoring, voice recording, automated messaging, touch 
tone and interactive voice response (IVR), as well as email and web 
integration capabilities. And being all on the same box eliminates so many of 
the interface and support complexities associated with other alternatives.

Our strong growth and product enhancements continue unabated. Our 
network-wide Graphical Manager and Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB) are setting 
entirely new thresholds of effectiveness and productivity! Also, we have just 
made yet another release of our Graphical Manager software and will now also 
shortly be releasing an even more expansive version of DCB.

We continue to add customer success profiles. You can view and print these 
(and others) from www.noblesys.com under 'Customers'.

Jeffrey, please advise whenever I can be of any assistance to you and/or your 
associates.

Again, Happy Thanksgiving!

Dan Donaldson

As we had expected for a few months, although it became imminent a week ago, 
Adrian Lajous is leaving Pemex,
and will be substituted by Rogelio Montemayor.
I have known Rogelio for some time; he is an outsider to the Energy sector, 
but a good Economist, who has 
held both technical positions in past Governments, as well as elected officer 
( Congressman, Senator and Governor
of Coahuila).
Rogelio is close to Francisco Labastida, the PRI candidate to the Presidency 
(elections-July 2000), and was proposed
by Luis Tellez (Secretary of Energy) as a transition CEO of Pemex, with whom 
he can work in some deregulation initiatives
before the change of Government (Dec. 2000).
This leaves our friend Luis Tellez in a very powerful position, since he was 
able to remove both the head of CFE & Pemex,
who were opposing his deregulation efforts. Hopefully, he will be able to 
transcend the change of Administration, and keep
his drive and level of influence.

  Regards, jaime_____

Ken & Jeff,

Each year I attend the Enron Management Conference the more I realize that 
the daily leadership and vision that the Office of the Chairman provides is 
what allows us to meet and exceed our goals. That leadership and vision in 
turn empowers every employee to do their job and that empowerment translates 
into continued success. That is what make Enron so unique in the global 
marketplace. Thank you for making this such a great company to work for. 

Doug

Hi, Kristin.  I guess we got our wires crossed last Friday about lunch.  
Sorry about that.  He told me that you guys have rescheduled for tomorrow 
(Tuesday) at 12:30 p.m. and that you will meet him there.  I'll make a 
reservation at Carrabas on Kirby in your Dad's name at that time.  Please let 
me know if you have a conflict.  Thanks, SRS

PS - I also have you down for lunch with your Dad on Friday, November 10 - do 
you have it down, too?

Brother Tools,
   As of this date, I, your hard working ticket procurement master, have
only heard from Mannino, Beek, Jordan, Kretz, Wallace, Elvis, Grumbles,
Glass, C-Paul, John Miller, and Space re: ordering tickets to sit with the
brothers of the pail.  I'm figuring I've got about two more weeks to wait to
place the order to ensure we all get block seating, so....if you're wanting
to sit within the Eye of Wooglin section, which, by the way, WILL OWN THE
FRICKING STADIUM THAT DAY, you kinda need to let me know as soon as you can.
  I'll be sending this message a few more times, so get used to it
dirtballs.
    See you at the game.

Yours in -kai-,
  Drow

PS.  Who in the hell bid Ricky Baier?
PSS. Feel free to forward this to any brother not on this list.

Jeffrey,

I tried sending this to you on Monday but had gotten an email rejection 
message from your email server? With summer time here, I hope you get some 
vacation in and that all is well with you and your associates. Permit me to 
again update you from our end:

TREND

At Noble Systems, we continue to expand and with an increasing number of new 
customers whose organizations had previously used some other predictive 
dialer but have now switched to us. One such new installation has just 
reported a net 20% increase in performance by switching to ATOMS.

REVAMPED WEBSITE

Noblesys.com has been totally revamped and with several new items added! 
Also, it is now a lot easier to navigate.  Please check it out!

In addition, under 'News' we've posted the announcement of our email ACD 
Module e_ATOMS ERMS (Email Response Management System) and our collaborative 
browsing module  e_ATOMS "chat". Please let me know if you'd like additional 
product information.

You'll also see our new trademark and "Contact To The Nth Degree" advertising 
tag.

NEW FEATURE

Agent-specific messaging. When an answer machine is encountered, ATOMS can 
leave a standard message without the call ever going to agent. Now with some 
agent identifying code in the dialing record, these messages may now be 
'agent-specific': in the agents own voice: "Sorry I missed you. This is Dan 
Donaldson of Noble Systems calling about a wonderful opportunity. Please call 
me at 888-434-2537."

DYNAMIC CAMPAIGN BUILDER (DCB)

Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB) has earned Best of Show at CT Expo in Los 
Angeles (Computer Telephony Magazine - April Issue - details ATOMS DCB).

Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB) enables supervisors to create entirely new 
outbound, inbound and blended campaigns and with graphical looking agent 
screens including branched logical scripts using embedded variables - and all 
without needing a programmer!

Please advise if you'd like more information on DCB and/or our DCB User 
Manual, I'll be glad to get it to you.

PERFECTSCRIPT

PerfectScript (Patent pending) eliminates people immediately hanging up 
because they notice the 'predictive delay time' do not want to hear "another 
telemarketer". PerfectScript is now in demand because on all outbound calls 
it minimizes this 'predictive delay time' by always promptly responding to 
the answering 'hello' with a recording in the agents own voice e.g. "Hello, 
this is Jeffrey of Enron Capital & Trade Corporation, may I speak with". As 
the agent, you hear most of your pre-recorded voice segment and when it ends, 
you simply speak and ask for the person being called.

And very importantly, with PerfectScript, every call automatically starts 
very positive and upbeat!

Additionally, PerfectScript also allows agents to use at will other 
pre-recorded segments e.g. responses to questions, standard instructions, 
disclosures etc. throughout the day. The other party does not detect any 
voice segment as being pre-recorded because there are no clicks or beeps. 
Agents talk less but since they pre-record these segments also using very 
positive voice inflections, their presentations are also more effective and 
upbeat!

OTHER SIGNIFICANT FEATURES

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) type functionality - Very importantly, 
callers can now get retrieve their information and balances without ever 
going to a live agent. Callers can be prompted for touch tone entries which 
may be used for routing, additional menu selections and/or voice messages.

Advanced Skills-based Routing - In addition to intelligent call routing to 
designated agent groups based upon unlimited ANI/DNIS combinations, ATOMS 
also enables you to rate each agent's proficiency in each of an unlimited of 
categories that you define. ATOMS will connect each incoming call to the most 
proficient agent available for the categories previously identified within 
the customer record.

ATOMS has now been internationalized. Among other benefits, support for all 
time zones and international telephone numbers is now included.

Near toll quality 16:1 end-to-end voice compression for remote locations.

Complete fault tolerance (via clustering).

EXTENDED SUPPORT HOURS

Responding to our growing install base, we now actually staff our customer 
support center 24 hours a day Monday thru Friday and 22 hours on Saturday. 
Support access via pagers is now only from Saturday night at 10:00 PM to 
12:01 AM on Monday morning.

EXPANDED PRODUCT FLEXIBILITY

ATOMS is now also available in lower-priced inbound-only configurations 
and/or inbound-only upgrades.

Also, with many ATOMS features, customers need only purchase the number of 
concurrent seats actually required. For example, predictive licenses, Digital 
Recording (DRS) ports, PerfectScript DRS ports, Email ACD (ERMS) licenses 
etc. may be shared by many different agents at different times as long as the 
total number of agents using any feature at any time does not exceed the 
total number of licenses purchased.

Jeffrey, I do hope you have a great summer and that this update is helpful. 
Whenever I can be of help in any way, please do not hesitate to call.

Have a great week!

As you know, the ENA gas floor came in with a $30 million VAR position 
today.  Even though this left us with another $10 million of unused VAR, I 
want to make you aware that we may exceed our VAR limit today. This move up 
was much bigger than the market anticipated, and natural gas volatility was 
up quite a bit. The VAR calculation is now kicked off at 2:00am and we will 
know our VAR position by 6:00am.  If we are over, I will need to ask for a 
one day increase.  I have already told the desk heads that we will most 
likely need to sell some contracts tonight and tomorrow.

Tom,

>From previous notes, which I bcc'd to you, looks like I'm "in business".

I've really appreciated your two recent e-mails (as I have all of them).
Had gone to the Tribune web site (something I'd done before, in order to
show my friends here your picture, and brag a bit) looking for info on
percepctive section, but probably due to my bad searches didn't unearth it.
You explanation was very important.  Also important were your comments on
what struck you about what I've been writing.  Those kind of comments are
the best kind.  Often, when writing, its hard to know what works and what
doesn't work.

Perhaps the most important thing, however, is that the article will be
published by "Tom Skilling's" brother.  Though nothing's been published yet,
and I shouldn't write as if that's a certainty (afraid of bad luck), would
never had gotten close to this opportunity without you.  I'm very grateful.

Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol'
newspaper media machine works (something with which I guess you are all to
familiar).

Mark-O

Jeff,


John Blaisdell had forwarded you a term sheet last week on Photofete.  I
have attached a second draft which incorporates a few changes based on
conversations I had with Mark Hughes at Thompson Knight and Jennifer Binder.
Please give me a call if you have any comments on the term sheet.  I have
advised Mark that we will not begin the drafting process until we have heard
back from him that the terms are acceptable.

Howdy Fellow Maggots,???????  ???????  ???????  ???????  ???????  ??????? 
9/15/00
?
Thanks to the efforts of Chuck Paul we have added to more brothers to our  
Beta message list.? They are: Jim Glass and Clay Coburn.? I'm sure  that it 
is only a matter of time before I can report that they too will be  joining 
the party in Dallas.
?
I've received a couple of ideas for a rendezvous for dinner on Thursday  
evening of HC weekend.? The first was from Jim Dent.? He suggests that  we 
chow down at The Double Tree and Central Expressway.? John Grumbles had  
another idea and elaborated: 
?
??????? "Fred: Gordo's is  reopened and has the same pizza. I can try to get 
us  ??????? an area set aside for Thursday  night
??????? if you wish. Also, right  down the street is the Time Out Tavern,  
shuffle
??????? board , pool, hole in the  wall with Harley's.
??????? Last time  Woody was there, he had to spend the night at my house;  
??????? last time Elvis was there he got into  
??????? small encounter that spilled  into the parking lot. Could be fun. 
Ask  the
??????? brothers and I'll set it  up."
???????  -kai-
??????? Gbles
?
Let's hear from some more of you guys that are going to be joining us on  
Thursday night.? What do YOU think?
?
Several have asked where I am staying.? That would be the Crowne Plaza  Hotel 
in Addison.? Art Kretz too.
?
Check out the attachment.

Jeff -

Thanks for spending some time with us at our office.

On the high yield side, I have never seen my boss so quiet and uncomfortable
at a company meeting.
Rumor is he left early to sell the telecom stocks he held in his own
account.

On the equity side, our utility fund manager is still getting up to speed.
Enron was the last stock I recommended at Loomis Sayles in 1998, and I have
consistantly advocated a
major overweight here at Eaton, but she has been slow to buy and quick to
sell.  I understand she is buying again.

In any event, there is no doubt you made a deep impression on all of the
Eaton participants.

Best regards, Dave

Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity,
but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy
travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has
turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit
the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr.
Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for
Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet
with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

Jeff,

Seth Spalding here, director of research at epoch partners. We met via
satellite this january when you presented at CE unterberg towbins conference
in New York. I have since moved from ceut to epoch partners. In any case, I
ran across a company, backed by bill tai at redpoint ventures, that has some
excellent distributed IP technology used to bring SS7 like functionality to
IP networks. I thought you or someone at enron might be interested in
speaking with them in light of your bandwidth exchange plans. The company is
called eyefrog, and has nothing of depth available on their website. If this
would be of interest to you, please let me know and I would be happy to put
you in touch.
Regards,
Seth Spalding

Mom and Dad,
?
Off tomorrow to Macedonia to finish up negotiations with the government there 
regarding the "purchase" of state-owned property on which our client wants to 
build a hotel.? I drafted the contract, which was interesting because the 
country still has laws that do not allow the private ownership of 
property.??Will be interested to see if any bank will lend?money that is 
secured by such a wishy-washy?property right.? Great stuff.? Be back late 
Friday.
?
Love to all,

Jeff and I met with Troy Blakney this morning - he has agreed to join the 
selection committee. We plan to meet tomorrow with Red Duke (lunch) and Roel 
Campos (breakfast). Jeff has spoken with Gerald Smith and he has also agreed 
to join the committee. 

In terms of an action plan:
Once we have finalized the committee members, I will schedule a meeting 
(preferably before the Febr. 1 scheduled news conference) with all members to 
offer them an opportunity to meet one another and discuss how we will proceed.
Next, I will begin scheduling meetings with some key people that  would 
provide the committee with important insight into the key issues facing the 
HFD. Jeff suggested possibly blocking out an entire day where the committee 
members would speak to these individuals back to back in 1 or 2 hour time 
slots.
Then, a full day will be blocked out where the committee members will 
interview the approximate 10 identified candidates.
The committee will then meet (half a day?) to narrow the list of 10 down to 3.
The three final candidates will be presented to the Mayor.

Lisa

Dear Mr. Morgan,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to
speak
to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat
intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his
time,
he must respectfully decline your invitation.

Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level
representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do
what I can to facilitate that for you.

Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the

opportunity.

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the "truth").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a "special" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Jeff,

Wanted to drop a quick note to follow up on our conversation on Saturday. 

I am definitely interested in what the plan sounds like as modified. If you 
and I can find the right combination of tasks, it should work well; the 
matters you mentioned would all seem to fit into a split schedule. 

My schedule can be as flexible as needed, with the only restriction (a big 
one, I must admit) being that I would want to spend as much time in Istanbul 
as possible, both for Sukran and me. 

As we discussed, if you and I think there is a niche that would make sense 
for me, I could be in Houston for up to six months a year. Perhaps it would 
be helpful if we initially assumed that my schedule would include one month 
in Houston then one month in Istanbul, followed by two longer two-month 
periods in Houston and Istanbul.?This?schedule could be fragmented or even 
consolidated further, and of course there would have to a fair amount of 
playing it by ear. One thing I would be trying to do as things played out -- 
provided of course that none of my projects with you was put at risk -- would 
be to shave off a week here, a day or two there, so as to maximize my time in 
Istanbul.? I would do what was necessary to have myself well-wired into the 
States, and should be able to handle quite a few things effectively even from 
here. ??

As I mentioned, I have a lot going on here these next four or five months 
getting things set up with Sukran, but I could come to Houston for a month 
here, a month there, perhaps for the first time in approximately a month. 
After that, full-steam ahead. 

You might be wondering about my present work.?I would try to hold onto the 
newsletter, as that would continue to provide a great vehicle for my learning 
and writing about this place. Otherwise, my work here is not something we 
should worry to much about as we consider the above further. 

Yours with love,

Mark 

P.S.? Enjoy the festivities in Washington and say hey to Tom.

Hi, Beek.

I'm going through all of your e-mails to Jeff and am not able to find the 
information on Elvis' party Friday night.  Someone had sent an attachment 
with the details, but I was unable to open it.  Would you mind sending us the 
"final" agenda for the festivities this weekend?  Jeff will arrive in Dallas 
+/- 4:00p Friday night and will be staying at the Crescent Court hotel.  
Thanks so much!  SRS

Howdy,

Going to be in Munich one night on way to SF.  Unplanned, it turns out will
be there during Octoberfest (which starts in September).  Does anyone know
of a reasonably priced place to stay there, with e-mail address?  Don't want
to sleeping it off on the cobblestones.  Thanks.

Mark-O

Dear Sr. Rivera,

I'm writing on behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling in response to your e-mail below.  

Mr. Skilling is very interested in meeting with Sr. Rafael Miranda.  
Unfortunately, he does not have any planned trips to Europe within the next 
couple of months, though that may change after the first of the year.  If, 
however, Sr. Miranda has any plans to be stateside, I would be happy to 
arrange a time for the two of them to meet.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Per our discussion at the Executive Committee meeting this morning, please 
identify 2 representatives for the Associate and Analyst PRC process and 1 
individual as commercial staffing lead.  The criteria for these individuals 
are as follows:

PRC Representatives
The PRC for Associates and Analysts will be conducted like the VP and MD 
process.   A committee selected by Executive Committee members will 
facilitate the process.  The Office of the Chairman believes that 
participation in the Associate and Analyst PRC should be a platform for 
exposure to election to the next level in the organization.  Consequently, 
Associate PRC representatives should be Vice Presidents who are on promotion 
track to MD and Analyst representatives should be Directors who are on 
promotion track to Vice President. 

Commercial Staffing Leads
 We need your assistance to determine accurate hiring targets to ensure that 
the talent we attract will be valued and utilized meaningfully.   The Office 
of the Chairman is ultimately holding each CEO accountable for working with 
the Program Staffing Coordinators to staff the talent and to determine the 
hiring goals.  The CEO may delegate this responsibility to a highly 
respected, interested, senior commercial person.  This responsibility should 
not be delegated to an HR representative.
Please provide the names by end of the day tomorrow,  5/9/00.  Thanks, to 
those of you who have responded.
Charlene

Jeff,

I spoke with Mark Palmer concerning the interview with Businessweek magazine, 
January 2nd.  He has asked me to participate in the article to discuss Enron 
Media Services and thought it would be a good idea for me  to give you a 
quick update in the event the reporter questions you about the business.  Let 
me know if you would like for me to stop by or call you to bring you up to 
date.   I will be out on vacation December 20th returning January 2nd.

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO.

My consulting assignment at Azurix will end next month, so I've put calls in 
to Cliff and Mark Metts to see if either of them needs help with either 
corporate trouble-shooting, or M&A execution. 

I thought I should also ask a related question of the two of you: anything 
that I could assist you with? 

As to the question whether I can be helpful, I believe that Colin, John, and 
Michael have been pleased with my contributions, though you should ask them 
directly.

Please let me know if you have any ideas.

Thanks.

Jeffrey,

Just a quicknote to say hello.  Looking forward to the prophesized
letter.

You'll be interested to know that a couple weeks ago, when I was on my
way to Greece to renew my visa, passed Enron's progject at Marmara
Eregilisi, a town on the Maramara Sea, which is the same body of water
that has the island where Abdullah Ocalan ("Apo", the Kurdish terrorist)
is beng held.  Had read about the project in a Turkish newspaper
(English translation; not ready to read real Turkish newpapers yet)
earlier.  Also read an article about a study Enron did for the US
government about the natural gas pipeline from Baku through Geogia to
the Black Sea coast.  You guys are everywhere.

I also read that The Economist is sponsoring some sort of energy
conference in Ankara (which is suppose to be a gloomy sort of place;
especially this time of year) in the next few weeks.  Are you going?

Least you think all I do is read about Enron, been having the time of my
life here, which is not to say things have been easy.  But I'm still
where things like standing in four different lines at the port office to
pick up a pakage is charming.  (Besides Asia Minor being the birth place
of agriculture, democarcy and Christianity [all, albeit, in the distant
past], it was also the birthplace of buracracy [as you probably know,
the word byzantine comes from Byzantium, the name for Istanbul before it
became Constantinople].)

Hope all is well.

Love,

Mark

Subject: Additional PRC Reps and Attending the PRC


We have received numerous requests from individuals in the business units who 
either want to add someone to the PRC Committee or who want to have someone 
attend the Associate and/or Analyst PRC meetings because they do not have a 
representative on the Committees.  

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time 
because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the 
existing PRC Reps.  Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next 
week, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather 
information.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and 
Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional 
Reps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names 
to Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments 
were as follows:

The person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by 
the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company
The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents
The Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors

The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for 
several reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain 
additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond 
their business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC 
Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if 
they are required to disagree with a more senior individual.  

We have also received request from individuals wanting to "observe" the 
meeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just 
observe if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the 
major units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division 
represented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining 
why the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates' & 
Analysts' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts 
in the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps' 
responsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates' and Analysts' 
managers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate 
objectively for the individual.
Also, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or 
impossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.  

I hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they 
should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.

Thanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.

Charlene

Sherri, here's the info you need.  I would recommend that they both join the 
cycling club at $35 each, and then we will pay for their registrations.  Jeff 
Skilling's has already been paid for even though he hasn't paid his dues for 
2001.  Effectively,  the bike club pays the registrations through the 
membership fees, and his daughter would be eligible to join with him, so if 
you could forward me a check for $70, and get his/her membership and her 
MS150 form back to me, I'll take care of everything.  (We already have Jeff's 
MS150 registration done, as I said.)

On the fundraising:  Please mention to Jeff that BP, who is the main sponsor 
of this year's tour, has issued a challenge to Enron.  They are seriously out 
to beat us out of first place and they claim that they already have 400 
riders.  We, of course, don't want that to happen, although we are pleased 
with the jump-start we have given to the Houston corporate world in relation 
to this ride.  I'm encouraging our current team members to raise their 
fundraising as much as possible, and especially our top people.  Do you think 
we could get Jeff to $100,000 this year?  Last year he came in at $65,000.  
Wendy Gramm is not riding this year because Phil Gramm has a high school 
reunion the same night, so could Jeff ask Wendy to raise money anyway and 
throw it our way, or she could just raise the money and give herself the 
credit even though she's not riding?  Do you have any ideas on that?  Do you 
want me to contact her to discuss or would it be better for you or Rebecca to 
do that?  



MS150 - April 21-22

Amelia, would you please e-mail me the Enron team sign up for for MS150?  
Jeff's daughter would like to ride with the Enron team.  Let me know what I 
owe you for that, and I'll send you a check when she fills out the 
registration form.  Thanks, SRS

Dear Richard,

As per my conversation with Jeff Skilling last week in which he suggested 
that I contact you, I would like to request the names of the companies who we 
outsource some of our accounting needs to.  I would like to target them for 
our latest product: Data Storage Capacity.  Please let me know how you would 
like me to proceed regarding this matter.  Thank you.

Dear Jeff,

Several months ago, you agreed to participate in an interview about problem
solving for a book I am writing to be published later this year.  The
manuscript is rapidly coming to completion, and I want to take this
opportunity to make contact for several reasons.

First, I've enclosed a draft of the chapter that covers you.  If you or an
assistant have time to read this, make a check for factual errors and let
me know your reaction within two weeks of this letter's date, I would very
much appreciate it.  The production schedule at this point is strict, and
unfortunately, our miscommunication about your change in email address
hasn't left us much time.  End of this week will be OK though.  If you have
any additional insights you feel should be added, or important things I've
missed, please include those as well.  Any comments can be emailed to me at
chrishoenig@exolve.com.

Second, thank you so much for your time and the kind assistance of your
staff, in helping to make this project work.  I believe you will find the
final product of some interest, and I will make sure that you get a free
copy upon publication.

Third, In return for sharing your insights, I'd like to offer you the only
compensation I can at this time, which is to share knowledge in return.  If
there is one organization - for example, the leadership team of a local
charity, a citizen's group - that you would like to receive a briefing or
hear a speech on this subject, I would be pleased to contribute.

Fourth, I am currently in the process of founding a non-profit organization
that will be dedicated to gathering knowledge on problem solving to create
a public trust that can be a resource for educators around the world.  Just
as other conservation organizations identify and protect land, historical
treasures or other assets, in the knowledge age, I believe that the core
high quality knowledge on how human beings solve problems should also be
conserved, protected and made widely available throughout educational
systems.  If this project interests you and you would like more information
or to lend your support, we would welcome your involvement.

Most Sincerely,


Christopher Hoenig

Jeff, 
Thanks for the floor speech on 32 yesterday.  It's always great to hear "the 
boss" say that you're doing a good job and that Enron still has a lot in 
store for the future.  You don't know how much that helps us motivate our 
guys and keep them focused on our goals.
Victor

Dave / Janet - 

There was some confusion after the executive committee meeting on Monday.  
Whalley & I discussed yesterday.

Following is a clarification note that I forwarded to Whalley this AM.


Thanks - Dan

Subject: UC/CSU Procedural Next Steps

As you know, UC/CSU sued us for breach of contract in March.  At the same 
time they moved for a preliminary injunction to restore them to direct access 
during the pendency of the case.  The district court granted their motion and 
issued the preliminary injunction.  We appealed the granting of a preliminary 
injunction in these circumstances, and, in addition, asked the Court of 
Appeals to stay the effect of the district court's order until our appeal 
could be heard.

The Court of Appeals granted our request for a stay.  Because of the 
similarity beween the legal tests for granting a stay and for granting of 
preliminary injunction, to grant the stay the Court of Appeals necessarily 
had to find, at least preliminarily, that the district court likely erred in 
granting the preliminary injunction.  This is why we think we will win our 
appeal, especially if it is heard by the same panel.  (Whether or not it is 
heard by the same panel depends on the clerk of the Court of Appeals and the 
schedules of the judges.)

We filed our brief in support of our appeal on May 14.  UC/CSU's and the AG's 
answering briefs must be filed by June 11.  Our reply brief is due 14 days 
after their briefs are filed.  The appeal is then referred to a 3-judge 
panel.  Oral argument is usually allowed.

If we win the appeal, UC/CSU campuses in PG&E and SCE territory remain on 
utililty service until a final decision is made in the case.   If we lose the 
appeal, we have to take them back until a final decision in made in the 
case.  The appeal relates only to the preliminary injunction.  The breach of 
contract action remains to be tried at the district court level.  

The contract expires March 31, 2002.  In the ordinary course a final decision 
in the case would not be made by then.  The judge, however, could expedite 
the proceedings so that a decision could be made earlier.  UC/CSU could also 
move for summary judgment, arguing that that facts are not in dispute and 
that the judge should rule without a trial.  In either event, it would seem 
unlikely that a final decision even on a expedited basis could be handed down 
before late fall/winter.

Please call me with any questions.  Thanks.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Tuesday, August 17, 1999

The afternoon ezan is as if a lament.  The muezzin's voice seems fuller,
more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity in
my neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precaution
against fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)
  But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relatively
untouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking the
square surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partially
blocking the road that circles the square.

Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, the
first a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began this
morning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building off
its foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, its
roof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severed
neatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildings
flattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steel
reinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms of
friends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves her
microphone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trapped
there, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debris
above.

I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and I
had spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under trees
whose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus.
(Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by Sultan
Mahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over the
corrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke of
writing, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, about
learning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter along
the coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with the
worst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect,
it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our lives
over, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in my
bed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips that
are many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2
am.

It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm not
sure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds.
Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggering
deeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in San
Francisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it got
really bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, and
whatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and sounds
confused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that there
were other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon,
however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in my
hallway, where three doorways were close together.

The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building,
are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells like
waves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all like
the comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my building
being all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise.
Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd new
angles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imagine
that things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of the
relatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soon
the shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then I
really started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked with
adrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, a
flashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- and
I had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even my
camera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was off
by the time I opened my door a minute or two later.

My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off to
one side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it for
a quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light here
and there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning across
the Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes of
a few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars.
Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  I
worked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may have
collapsed.

I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gathered
in the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though I
occasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  At
one point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along Istiklal
Caddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricity
being out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidence
of the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, an
abandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt.
But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, in
one hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (which
as I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, most
were huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the women
were wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? next
to the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people there
and, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty of
so miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may have
collapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.
  That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were a
series of fairly significant aftershocks.

On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has been
rescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appears
unscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking him
questions.  Were you scared?  "Cok kokum [very scared]!"  He seems pleased
to be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is asked
about his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  "Annem [my mother],
kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices].
Duydum!"  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  "Sesleri
duydum!  Sesleri duydum!"

Turkiye, iyi sanslar.

Dear Jeff:

I think the meeting went well. You do realize I had to get a lot of ground
work done. Dave is a smart man and he was very positive. He indicated to us
after you left, he will like to see us work with you to get a few deals
moving, realizing the culture of ATT.He will go out of the way to help you
and me accomplish what we think is best for the entire industry.

You may want to send him a thank you note, -  draft enclosed. Feel free to
edit it and add your style. Look forward to working with you. There are so
many thoughts in my mind which one day I will like to download on you -
perhaps over dinner. Please check with Ken how to work out the arrangements
with Adventis on the ATT relationship building , Sourcing and the Japan
related opportunities.

Talk to you soon.

Regards,

Partha

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=

and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=

Dear Neil,

If you can come to ours, it would be greatly appreciated.  We're located at 
1400 Smith Street, Suite 5007.  You can park in the Allen Center Garage 
visitor parking (entrances off of Clay and Andrews Streets), which is 
connected to our building by a skywalk on the 3rd floor.  You'll have to 
check in with security in the lobby of our building, but I'll let them know 
you and Paul are expected so as to expedite the process.  Will anyone else be 
accompanying you?  Please advise.  Thank you.

Thanks for the reply Sherri.  I missed Jeff last night at Paul's so we
didn't get a chance to talk.  Paul and I would appreciate the opportunity
to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given
everyone's tight schedules, but please find below some dates that work for
Paul and me:

Dec 11 afternoon; Dec 12 afternoon; Dec 13 10:30-2:00; Dec 15 afternoon;
Dec
18/19/21 all day

Please let me know if any of these dates work so we can set a firm time.
If
Jeff wants to combine with lunch, that would be great too.  Thanks/Neil.

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Pre-FOMC and the market is, to quote Joe Cocker, "Feelin' Alright". The Dow
Industrials shot up over100 points in the morning and hovered there to close
up over 135. The Nasdaq followed suit in the morning, came in in the

Micro Devices) all closing in the red - guess that Celeron news was abit of

Microsystems), CA (Computer Associates), AAPL (Apple Computer) all up over
4% and MSFT (Microsoft), DELL (Dell) and IBM up over 2%. There were a couple

Dear Jeffrey
Airfreight to Houston airport will cost R 2 744.00.  This cost is for the 
service of delivery to the airport and excludes US customs  and duty. South 
Africa is on the?US list of  developing countries and therefore you might pay 
little or no duty if you tell  US customs that the goods are from South 
Africa?and that they are for  personal use. If you wish to pay by credit card
we will need the last 3 digits at the back of the  same credit card that you 
used to pay for your goods.
Regards
Hilary

Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a
block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men
reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about;
mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like
after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

The first mark of a Beta will be his Beta  Spirit.....
?
Here are a few pictures you might enjoy.? The  brothers are all dressed up, 
so it must have been a "spring formal" or  something... but who can remember 
back a quarter century?? Are the guys  that were not wearing ties practicing 
the proverbial "Beta no  date-a"?
?
The 5 Betas are Jeff Skilling, Tom McSoley, Rene  Molina, Rob Bugh and Chuck 
Peterson.? Check out Bugh - looks like he's  posing for GQ.
?
The 15 Betas are standing L-R:? Singleton,  Shackleton, Anderson, McSoley, 
Thompson, Molina, Baddour, Bugh, Zaremba,  Skilling, Stewart, Peeler.? In 
front L-R: Wengierski, Peterson,  Mannino.
?
Jansson_Big Bend - Bill Jansson "piloting" down the  Rio Grande on spring 
break mere months after the release of the inspiring movie  "Deliverance."? 
Those sure are pretty lips..... squeal like a pig....you  know the rest.

Fred,  I now have a scanner that works (actually the scannner has always
worked).  It's ME that doesn't know how to use the scanner but here's a
shot
at it.  This picture was taken at dinner the night before the SMU/KU game
last month in Big D.

Send it out if you get it OK!!

Chuck

I heard back from Mike Arends.  He was out of town on a business/vacation

married on Nov. 11, but his fiancee is supportive of the trip.  (I wonder
how long that kind of cooperation will last?)
Anyway....if you want to give him a call, his number at work is:  800

Jeff -- You are scheduled to appear on the "News Hour with Jim Lehrer" this 
afternoon during the 5 p.m. show to talk about how successful companies 
recruit college graduates.  Ray Suarez will be the substitute anchor for Jim 
Lehrer.  The recruiting segment, for which you are one of four panelists, 
will run approximately 12 to 14 minutes, probably in the first half of the 
one-hour show.  The other panelists are:

 Marilyn Mackes, executive director of the National Association of Colleges 
and Employers (Philadelphia)
 Ken Ramberg, CEO and co-founder of Jobtrack.com, the portal most 
universities use to post jobs for students and graduates (Los Angeles)
 Bill Carson, director of career services for Morgan State University 
(Baltimore)

There will be a three-minute background piece filmed at a recent college 
graduation in Portland that will air prior to the roundtable discussion.  
Once that airs, the anchor will ask questions of each of the panelists and 
start a discussion that will generally follow the format of the pre-interview 
you did on Wednesday.  Don't worry about keeping your comments short.  The 
show wants to encourage an in-depth discussion about recruiting.   If another 
panelist makes a comment that you agree or disagree with, feel free to jump 
in and add your opinion.

We will be set up in the Board room, and the show has asked that you be ready 
by 4:45 p.m.  The show airs live at 5 p.m., and the segment should air in the 
first half of the show. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.
Karen

Hi Jeff,

First, thank you so much for your hospitality the other evening. And
good company.

I emailed Jane and she will get the message Monday morning. I put you on
the message as well so now you have her address.  When I see her I will
fill her in on details and mention your willingness to be an active
parent when Kristen comes here.

I will also email Brenda Bouchard at the Harvard Club. If you are still
interested.


So I checked out enron. You didn't say you were the *largest* energy
trading company!  Or even say it was a large energy company.   Just gas
or oil too?  Does the name Charles Lawrence mean anything to you?  Wall
Street. Oil specialty. Checking out your history skills.

Let me know if there is anything more I can do at BU,  and let us know
when you are coming to Boston again.  Maria and Cheryl are very wired
into the Hill scene. Maria at the Union Club and Governor's office and
Chery everywhere in Boston. And Jane (who you will meet) in the Bahamas.

Regards,

Kay

John Sherriff has asked me to update you on the status of our relationship 
with EnCom, as well as what I am doing to develop a plan for the way forward 
with our investment.

Background

As you may be aware, Enron made its investment in EnCom in October 1999.  
Bruce Wrobel is President/CEO.  Our current cumulative investment is now 
$34,750,000.  We own 63.80 %, and have the right to put 5 members on a board 
of nine.  There are two other strategic, Japanese investors in the business; 
Orix, primarily known as a leasing firm, and YTC, primarily a parts supplier 
for Toyota.  Enron Japan (EJ) in particular values Orix as a strategic 
partner even beyond the context of EnCom (a fact that was reconfirmed when 
Ken Lay met with their Chairman during his recent week in Tokyo).  

At present, the relationship between EnCom (its vehicle for doing business in 
Japan is E Power; and I will use the two terms interchangeably) and EJ is a 
difficult one.  EnCom entered the Japanese market some months before EJ 
entered, and EnCom was seen in the market as Enron's entry vehicle for 
Japan.  I infer that EnCom has benefited from this association with the Enron 
name, and Enron apparently did not discourage it in the early days.  With the 
arrival of EJ in Tokyo early this year, Enron is working to roll out our 
wholesale/merchant business model in Japan.  EnCom/E Power has and continues 
to receive coverage in the media (much of it self-generated) indicating that 
they intend to sign up customers.  In fact, E Power's COO Mr. Awono, says 
that they will need to sign up retail customers to be able to have load to 
support the large power projects they are planning to do.  (This unlikely 
formula suggests, at least on his part, a degree of naivete, at best, about 
how offtake from plants in deregulated markets can be and should be 
managed.).  Finally, EJ reports meeting with customers, e.g., Sony, who 
indicate that E Power holds itself out as also being a "trader".  This has 
caused some confusion in the marketplace about which "Enron" entity is 
providing wholesale/merchant services.  

There now also is a question as to what EnCom's business model in Japan 
should be.  Conversations between Orix and EJ personnel in Tokyo suggest that 
Orix believed that Enron would be intimately involved in the day-to-day 
management of EnCom (we are not, and Bruce has conceded that prior to EJ's 
reporting relationship into London being established, Enron involvement and 
direction was largely absent).  Moreover, it appears that Orix also believed 
that EnCom would be engaged in the business of "aggregation" of power 
supplies for further resale in the Japanese market (this is essentially 
describing the core Enron merchant business in different terms).  
Conversations between Orix and EJ indicate that Orix now does not see EnCom 
having in place the people and skills to execute on an aggregation business 
strategy.  Rather, Orix sees EnCom as having the skill sets of large-scale 
asset developers, and this is not a business Orix is particularly interested 
in pursuing.  Finally, Orix has an employee secunded to EnCom/E Power, and he 
reports that Orix now even lacks confidence in EnCom's ability to deliver any 
large-scale asset development opportunities.  John and I are tentatively 
scheduled to meet Orix's Chairman in London on 27th November.

To give E Power its due, it is now also frustrated (Wrobel telephone 
conversation with me) because Ken Lay clearly signaled in some of his media 
interviews in Tokyo that we were bringing the full panoply of Enron skills to 
the market, including the possibility of large-scale power projects.  It is 
Wrobel's view that this message in the marketplace now undercuts EnCom, as he 
believes that people will look to a $60 billion market cap company as a 
preferred counterparty for asset development, over a company capitalised at 
present to the tune of about $40 million.  There is also a Business 
Opportunities Agreement between EnCom and EJ addressing how opportunities 
that come to Enron personnel, who are also on EnCom's Board, should be 
handled.    Wrobel believes that we are being a bit narrow in our 
interpretation of the Business Opportunities Agreement, a view I do not 
share. Ken's statements are correct, i.e., we can do large-scale developments 
in JapanIn sum, there is not an agreement as to a clear division of lines of 
business between the two organisations.

At present, frustrations on both sides about confusion in the marketplace and 
in media messages (EnCom has now agreed that Enron will lead all contacts 
with the media, for both firms), have contributed to a situation that is not 
amicable.  Communications in Tokyo between EJ and E Power have virtually 
dried up, though recently EJ has invited E Power to work together on a 
Proposal for Mitsubishi.   

So Where Are We?

John has asked me to lead an effort to evaluate Enron's investment in EnCom.  
This will be fairly comprehensive, including an assessment of the talent on 
the ground in Tokyo, an assessment of the viability of their prospects (both 
in terms of likelihood of permitting, and, to the extent possible, their 
economics), and an assessment of what Enron's stake in this venture ought to 
be going forward.  I will evaluate the full range, from assuming 100% 
control, to a reduced stake (even down to zero), to taking equity in 
particular projects.  As such, I have sent to Wrobel a list of items 
reflecting our initial information requirements for due diligence.  

Second, while this due diligence proceeds, we are also attempting to agree on 
respective roles for EnCom and EJ in the Japanese market.  We remain 
committed to retaining an asset development capability in the market, which 
does not go down well with Wrobel.  We also are sceptical that EnCom has on 
board now, or will acquire, the risk management skills that we believe will 
be necessary to actually manage fuel and offtake along the lines that Enron 
has found highly profitable, e.g., Sutton Bridge tolling.  We have said that 
we respect their talent for being able to develop large-scale assets (though 
our Technical Services Group has already questioned their high staffing 
levels), and that we feel the profit-maximising strategy for both firms is 
for EnCom to develop projects (sites, permits, engineering), with Enron 
holding a tolling agreement and doing the project financing.  We believe E 
Power should be able to develop very bankable deals on this basis.  We do not 
have agreement on this point.  Wrobel seemingly believes that they will be 
able to do the risk management functions, and receive lucrative returns for 
the assets they do develop.  At this early stage we see no evidence that they 
can manage such risks (or that lenders would let them do that), and that it 
is more likely that they will end up with a classic IPP structure with gas 
"in", PPA "out", and reasonable but not rich returns on equity.  Wrobel sees 
our "tolling agreement" proposition as taking too much out of EnCom's deals.  
For our part, we have said we are willing to assure attractive equity returns 
(without saying what that number is), and reward them for their development 
efforts.

Our latest effort is to try to agree a tolling arrangement for a project in 
Tohoku province.  E Power has already met local officials.  As it turns out, 
EJ was approached by national government to do a project at the same 
industrial complex as that which E Power is working on.  By letter from me to 
Wrobel of 15 November, Enron has proposed that we pool or combine our efforts 
(i.e., E Power's engineering and local permitting expertise, with Enron's 
political capital garnered at national level), get the project done together 
rather than competing, and divide our labours as noted above, i.e., Enron 
does fuel and off-take, E Power does development of the asset.  In the phone 
call from me to Wrobel that preceded the sending of the letter, Wrobel 
expressed serious displeasure with Enron's proposal.  He and I are to speak 
again; he is to call me back, and if he does not do so on 17 November, I will 
call him on 20 November.         

I will plan to make progress on my wider review assuming cooperation from 
EnCom on our due diligence information requirements.  John and I are 
committed to moving this forward quickly, but much of the necessary 
information is not in hand. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

    I thought your questions were righ on the mark.  Would you also add a
question regarding how they would handle union negotiations for higher pay
and benefits in light of fiscal pressures?

Look forward to seeing you

Jeff,

I hope all is well with you.

Sorry I missed you in NY a couple of weeks ago. I'd love to catch up with
you. Looks and sounds like you are still doing terrific things, and I use
you and Enron a great deal in conveying my message to investors and
managers.

Al Rappaport and I have completed our book, Expectations Investing, which
will be published by Harvard Business School Press in September. (See
attached preface). I'm really excited about the product, and I think you'll
find it interesting as well.

Al and I have asked the publisher to send you a more recent version for your
review. You'll probably get it in the next week or so.

Specifically, we'd be honored if you would endorse our book. The endorsers
we are targeting are a blue chip group, and we feel your perspective would
add a great deal.

Thanks in advance, and feel free to give me a shout if you have any
questions.

Michael

While we are continuing to work with Ted Murphy, etc, regarding component 
VAR, expiry phenomena, and the other issues that are crucially important to 
be able to effectively manage risk, (and prevent frequent violations), you 
should know this is the most important immediate issue we face.  Even with 
the IT constraints, which Beth Perlman has done a good job addressing for me, 
our organization is willing to do anything to help manage this process.  I 
have committed to Beth that will we help her find people with the ultimate 
goal or being able to run real time VAR calculations.  Rick's idea of 
allocating VAR in times like this would certainly be helpful (while we work 
to perfect our risk management capabilities), but is only a short term 
solution. 

On another note, I really believe we will see gas prices significantly higher 
this year, and have been working with Gary Hickerson to identify the best 
equity plays as well.  Is there a way to further capitalize on our view, that 
is, can Enron do anything structurally to capture more of this opportunity? 
This gas move might be one of those once in a 100 year environments. (Board 
permission, special vehicle, asset purchase, etc?)
 
Just as an FYI, even if all the ammonia and methane plants go down, the Nukes 
run at +95% capacity, and there are no events to interrupt supply, we think 
gas storage will end up at 2.55-2.6 Tcf at the end of the injection cycle.  

I'd appreciate any ideas.

Thank you, Erica.  I'm waiting to Jeff to return from a meeting (within an 
hour or so).  He is currently scheduled to be in Europe the week of September 
24, so at this time, he is not available for a September 25 dinner.  I'll 
advise as soon as I have a chance to speak to him.  Thanks again for your 
help.

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Regards,
Erica Harris

Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but
will return tomorrow morning.

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the
dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to
free up some time.  Thank you.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

Tom,

Once again good to hear from you.  Still no electricity or water, though
again luckily lap top battery working.  I am also surprised able to get on
line and get through.  Once electricity goes back on will probably have a
tougher time getting trhough.  A bit ironic.

Took a long walk around this morning, crossing the Galata Bridge into Old
Istanbul (my neighborhood can't be called young) and saw little evidence of
damage.  Suspect most of it in new construction areas out on the edge of
this huge metropolitan area, where conrers get cut.  This is a poor country
with a lot of folks struggling just to put the flimsiest of roofs over their
head.

Knock on wood, but think you can all rest easy.  Doesn't seem to be any fire
risk nearby, etc.  Your right about nighttime timing; was on the darkened
deck of a ship in a mighty stormy sea.  CNN says 7.8 or somthing in Izmit
(65 miles east of here)!  I'm on the top floor and had all kinds of images
going through my head, as you can imagine.

More later.  Love you too and looking forward to seeing you in October.

Mark-O

Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina and 
the contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.  

Long and short of it is - 

Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that a 
devaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy. 

Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the population 
remembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.

To devalue the currency, Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law 
- this requires  approval of the Federal Congress.

TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to the 
Convertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.  
Indeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.

A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as 
changing the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willing 
to suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then 
there is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way 
delink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.    
In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty.

The impact on Enron's P&L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso as 
the functional currency.  If we use the Peso as the functional currency - 
Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from a 
devaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there would 
be no impact on our income statement.   I will research this further in order 
to ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency.



Pete

Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to write you and suggest that the two of you 
meet for lunch tomorrow at Grotto on Westheimer at 1:00 p.m.  They don't take 
reservations, but the lunch crowd should have cleared out by that time.  Let 
me know if that's ok with you or if you decide not to drive and need him to 
pick you up.

Have a good time.  SRS

George, I didn't hear back from you, but I think I found the correct zip code 
- hopefully it's 77036.  I'm sending yours and Paco's tickets via courier, so 
you should received them by +/- 2:00p today.

Joannie:

As I mentioned, Jerry is in transit in Europe at the moment, and it will be
extremely difficult for me to get hold of him again today to reschedule.
Given the time difference involved I will not be able to contact him before
the appointed time tomorrow, and therefore I'd very much appreciate if we
could go ahead with the call as planned.  At least that way Mr. Skilling can
decide which of the dinners he would prefer to attend, I assume that the
more notice you have the better.

Due to the fact that Jeff is unable to attend on July 19, I believe it
would be better to reschedule the call for sometime next quarter.

Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr.
Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call
scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.

Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve
Friedman and other selected guests.  Our next dinner is scheduled for July
19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above
in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.

Brothers,
?
Keep the messages coming.? Your messages are laugh out loud  funny.? My wife 
wishes she were a Beta and could get in on the fun  to.? For example, in 
response to our selection of Lakewood Landing for  Thursday night- Jim Dent 
writes:
?
Beek:
?
"I regret to inform you  that the Lakewood Landing is a gay bar. Looks like 
some of the brothers will  have to go in drag. Get it, Elvis."
?
Brother Del  Dent
?
I sent this message to Tom Benson and he  responded:
?
"No wonder everyone was so  friendly!? That explains the bathrooms being 
marked "shipping" and  "receiving" ." 

Tom 

Shortly thereafter, I get a message (Anderson, you're  gunna like this) from 
Bill Jansson:
"There is no problem so large,that it can not be overcome by  the use of
high-explosives." LTjg Bill Jansson,USN-1983
?
Bill also included the a photograph. (see  attached).
?
Another source of great entertainment was the copy from  the SMU Alumni 
On-line Newsletter that John Miller circulated.? I couldn't  help suspecting 
the influence of the Drow factor.? I hope the responsible  party will humbly 
step forward and receive the clicks due him for such a  creative and humorous 
piece of writing that captured the essence of a 'Gamma  Omega' Beta. 
?
Many clicks,
BEEK

Elvis,
Woody sent me a note today.  In it he mentioned that he has the old roll
book from the fraternity house.  He said he took it because the young
fellas had no respect for the past.
This reminded me of an idea I had earlier.  I was thinking of the banner
for our tent and thinking of some way of making it clear that it was the
Old Betas tent...and beer.  I was thinking of 'Original House Betas',
'Silver/Grey Betas'(...though I've become a silver-gray, my heart keeps
time and measure... with Beta Theta Pi, to find my highest pleasure.
Samuel N Wilson, Hanover '72) or something like that to distinguish our
tent from the active Beta tent.
I'm sure there are any number of clever titles that accomplish the same
thing....keeping a bunch of young beer guzzling freeloading strangers out
of our fricking tent!
That's all.

BEEK

Per his request, we weren't able to video Gary Hamel's presentation at the 
Management Conference.  However, he was kind enough though to send along his 
PowerPoint presentation -- I understand that he doesn't typically do this.  I 
thought you would like to have it for your files.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee.  
I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate 
Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all 
important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time 
with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking 
about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any 
questions you may have.

To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, 
November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person 
and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged.  
Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.

I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for 
spending your time on this critical process.

Jeff

Elvis,
The link didn't work for me, so I went to www.photoclub.com and entered
Margaret's e-mail address in the guest box and...voila...it worked!

The reunion pictures were great and now I'm going to go back and check
out your turkey day pics right now.

Happy Holidays.

Jeff,

Once again, thank you very much for your advice on gas.

However, while your advise was sound in principal ("threatening a $3.00 upside
against a $0.50 downside, at the $5.00 level"), next time let me know if your
going to be off as much as 40%( we hit a $5.00 upside instead of $3.00).

Thanks for the help.

Bryan

Jeff,

The information below is for 1959 graduates.  I think that you mentioned that 
we were looking for a male, which would make Bill's maiden name question 
irrelevant.  Let me know if you find the person.  Like I mentioned earlier, I 
have another idea worth considering if this doesn't work.

Take care,
Billy

Billy,

Attached is the additional data.

The names are the current names.  If he is looking for a woman, I would have
to also ask for "original" name as well but this may not be necessary.  Let
me know if you can determine the sex.

I look forward to meeting you when you come to town and no you really don't
have to buy me lunch.  This is really a fun place to work.........

Bill

Hi, Jeff.? I wanted to send you my "business  card", not having one Friday 
night when my friends and I met you at the  Federalist in Boston.? I no 
longer work for Governor Cellucci and have a  real estate investment 
management company of my own. (see below)
?
To remind you, I am a BU alumna, having graduated  from the Graduate School 
of Management.? If your daughter thinks she might  like to attend BU and you 
need a database of alumni, I would be happy to meet  with her for a future 
reference. 
?
I would be remiss, however, if I did not mention my  alma mater undergraduate 
school, Simmons College.? It's located in the  Fenway and is the only women's 
college in Boston.? The college is noted for  training women to be leaders in 
diverse fields, from communications (my  undergraduate degree), to health 
care, to management, to name only a few  majors.?We have quite a number of 
notable women executives, media  celebrities, and lawyers, like myself, 
too!What's nice about Simmons is that it  combines the best of higher 
education worlds; i.e., it is a small liberal arts  university for women with 
a co-ed social life. ?Simmons is one of 32  other colleges in Boston and was 
ranked 15th among all colleges in the Northeast  by US News last year.? 
?
If I sound as if I'm promoting Simmons, I am.?  The reason I left 
Massachusetts?government last year was to run the  College's 
Centennial....once in a hundred year opportunity, you know!? And,  besides, 
Gov. Cellucci's wife Jan received her graduate degree from Simmons in  
library science, so he was fine with my departure.? 
?
If you think Kristy might entertain a women's  college, the website is 
www.simmons.edu.? My friend Patricia  Tencza is the Undergraduate Admissions 
Director.? If you or your daughter  want to email her, just mention my name.? 
Her email address is Patricia.Tencza@simmons.edu.
?
I hope your trip back to Houston was  fine.?? I enjoyed meeting you.? Wish we 
had a bit more time to  talk.? Regards,? Maria

Hi everyone,

One of my fellow Turkish students had a fancy camera, and took a picture
of me on top of a mountain above Istanbul on the Asain side.  He sent it
too me via e-mail, and now I'm trying to send it to you.  The version I
have isn't very clear, but what the heck.  The water you see behind me
is the Bosphorus, which is a 19 or so mile finger of water that connects
the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, in the process splitting Istanbul
in two.  The bridge you see is (cleverly) called the Bosphorus Bridge,
and looks a bit like a silver version of the Golden Gate, and the
portion of Istanbul beyond is European Istanbul.

More later.

Mark-O

Greetings, Tom.  I have a great picture of you, Jeff and Jeffrey at the

Jeff:

I have a dream.  In it you send out an E-Mail:  Will every Enron employee 
that has been wronged by Enron let me know.  I will personally see to it that 
all wrongs are redressed.

I worked for a big company that at one time abused people working for me.  My 
workers called a slow down on me.  My responsibilities could not be fulfilled 
with the slow down.  So I told my management  "You helped cause the problem.  
So now please help me solve it."  Luckily for me my management agreed.  They 
hosted a dinner for my supervisors and representatives of my workers at one 
of the best Steak Restaurants in town.  Before, during and after drinks, 
steaks, desserts and cigars, we listened and spoke.  Management's words and 
body language said  "We agree we wronged you.  We apologize.  We promise to 
try our best not to do it again.  Now please let us all get back to work."  
Nobody threatened anybody that night, and yet next day I had fully productive 
workers.

I have a dream that Enron can do as good, or better.  After all, are we not 
the best at just about every thing else?

I refuse to believe that any corporation can be the very best if they do not 
right wrongs.

I am very interested at hearing any comments you may have on the subject.

Best Regards,


Nieves G. Soto

Dear Sherri, or Rocky, or Jeff, or Elzie, or whomever,
    Tell his Enroness, Lord Rocky that his confirmation of his appearance at
Elvis' party Friday nite is "gate", that his regrets towards attending the
football game on Saturday is "beek", and that we really don't care if he
shows up or not really, as long as he sends his "gate, bar, goddess"
girlfriend he had with him at Miller's wedding and we'll all be just happy
as a piece of dog liver in our mouths.
     Make SURE he sees this message on his very large desk or we will invoke
the Eye of Wooglin upon him.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow

Salomon makes a negative call on chips; ENTU (Entrust Technologies) CA*
(Computer Associates) and BMCS* (BMC Software) miss big and oh yes lets not
forget the post-holiday reverberations of ORCL's (Oracle) # 2 man stepping
down - it wasn't pretty in tech. Is it any wonder the Nasdaq was never in
the green and closed down over 125? In listed-land it was Saudi Arabia
threatening to sink oil prices vs. some buoyancy in the financials and drugs
- and the bears won with the Dow Industrials closing down 77. In tech - ENTU
down over 50%, ORCL down almost 9%, AMAT (Applied Materials) AMD (Advanced
Micro Devices) NSM (National Semiconductor) down 10% or more, VTSS (Vitesse
Semiconductor) MU (Micron Technologies) TXN (Texas Instruments) down over
6%, LU* (Lucent Technologies) CSCO (Cisco Systems) SUNW (Sun Microsystems)
GE (General Electric) YHOO (Yahoo) all down over 4%, RHAT (Red Hat Inc) down
7% - a couple of bright spots (but only a couple) AOL (America Online) up
over 2 1/2% and T (AT&T) up over 3%. The oils and the drillers were a drag -
BPA (BP Amoco PLC) and APA (Apache Corp) down 7%, TX (Texaco Inc) CHV
(Chevron Corp) and SLB (Schlumberger Inc) down over 4%, XOM (Exxon Mobile)
down 3%, BHI (Baker Hughes Inc.) down 6% meanwhile IMNX (Immunex Corp) BGEN
(Biogen) LLY (Ely Lilly) all up 4%, AMG (Affliated Mangers Group) up 7%, BMY
(Bristol Myers Squibb) up 2% and the financials - WFC (Wells Fargo) GS
(Goldman Sachs Group) C (Citigroup) all up 1%, MER (Merrill Lynch) MWD (MS
Dean Witter) ONE (Bank One Corp) ALL (Allstate Corp) all up 2%.... In the
CEUT Universe the stories of the day were BMCS* and CA* - both down 40%
after negative pre-announcements - CA* announced first and Paul Rodriguez
attributed the miss to three factors - Europe, mainframe slowness and not
closing two deals; BMCS* followed - the street did not react positively to
their morning call. Karl Motey's space was hit due to the Saloman call -
PMCS* (PMC Sierra Corp) KOPN+ (Kopin) down 8, TLCM* (Telecom Semiconductors)
PSEM* (Pericom Semiconductors) down 9, SSTI* (Silicon Storage) down almost
15... JDSU (JDS Uniphase) down over 9... IMAN (Imanage Inc) down 8%....
PROX* (Proxim) down over 5... VRTS* (Veritas Software) down over 4 1/2,
MUSE* (Micromuse) up over 3 1/2.... SPOT* (Panam Sat) down over 2.... JBL*
(Jabil Circuit) down over 2.... COVD* (Covad) up over 1.... after the close
RDCM+ (Radcom) pre-announced negatively.

Mr. Kenneth Lay
Chairman
Enron Corporation
1440 Smith Street
Houston, Texas 77002

Dear Mr. Kenneth Lay:

This brief note concerns an innovative business development opportunity in
the rapidly expanding field of B2B eProcurement/e-commerce.  I am trying to
initiate a system to fully integrate an industry that is fragmented and in
need of adding scalable 'process' efficiencies.  This will require
substantial resources that are not available to me. These resources would be
less significant to a company like Enron Corporation.  However the upside
potential would, I believe, be significant to your corporation. The risk
reward ratio in this marketplace favors the upside potential significantly.
This market is ripe for innovation because of the fundamental need to
improve product and service delivery in a cost effective and timely manner.
The process has already begun but will require a critical mass player that
can deliver open-market eProcurement.  The process related savings alone
will be approximately $11 billion annual when an effective supply chain
system is implemented. The timing is critical since in the next 18- 36
months the winners and losers would have already lined up for success and
failure.  A linchpin is needed and it could well be Enron.  I have little
doubt that Enron could do the job and become the stand-alone leader in this
field.

I am writing to Enron Corporation to determine your potential interest in a
very large global marketplace that is poised for transformation and
transition.  This marketplace is currently valued in excess of $300 billion
annual worldwide with high profit margins as well as large continuing
revenue growth rates in excess of 10% annually. There are buy and sell side
opportunities for revenues as well as a transactional fee opportunity.

What I am proposing would be the critical next innovative step to enter a
new level of global sourcing, purchasing, risk management and distribution
for this industry.

I realize the vagueness and brevity of my comments but without an existing
level of confidentiality I cannot expand these thoughts.  If you have
interest in taking one additional step to determine if my strategic concept
has merit please let me know.

Best regards,

John Manfredonia

Tom,

I was trying to calculate how long it took just last night.  Because of the
quake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (I
had already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, including
preparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  On
Tuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hours
total.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizing
what I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for a
newspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is a
journalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writing
the other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though I
already knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I went
home that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in the
morning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add up
to?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion in
between.

Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There are
probably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday's
paper(!).

By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don't
get a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everything
was all right, but got no reponse to that question.)  Is everyting all
right?

More later, as I want to get this off in case you're still there (though
Ihipe you've gone home for some shut eye).  I have to sign off in about 20
minutes and get ready for my class.

Your little brother

Dad and Mom,
?
Hope Mom and Sue's trip to Florida went well, and that there were no problems 
with things like getting the correct change, etc.? I've heard that there is 
a?counting problem down there, with everyone using?different standards and 
then being stopped from doing the counting altogether.? Makes a lot 
of?trouble if all you want is a six-pack (of pop, that is) to go!
?
And Tom and Jeff's time in DC?
?
About the excess symbols that you all are getting in my email; Hotmail (i.e. 
Microsoft) recently added a more sophisitcated "Microsoft Word"-like program, 
and I suspect that Dad's computer needs a special program to filter out all 
the "infra-structure" stuff.? And guess what, (I suspect) Microsoft sells 
such a program.
?
All goes well.? Its cold here, but nothing like Chicago.? For example, it 
will go below freezing at night occasionally, hovering around the low forties 
mid-day.? Little wetness this year, which a problem given ?a shortage of 
electricity and the low water levels in the hydroelectric system.??
?
My boss turning out to be a?bit of a egomaniac.? He fired three people, in a 
huff about some little thing, over the phone on Friday (two support staff, 
one lawyer).??The lawyer, admittedly, was a joke, the?others?no great shakes 
(though, they were?as good as we've got).??The manner of their demise, 
however,?was inappropriate.??I could tell you more.? For example, I 
often?suggest that we hire more experienced lawyers, expecially given the 
stuff he has me saying in our promo materials (and the prices we charge).? He 
demures, saying that experienced attorneys have "bad habits" (like, perhaps, 
experience?; and I guess he would thus include me amongst those with "bad 
habits").? I suspect the real reason he feels this way is?that he doesn't 
want to be second guessed.? Still (though I am starting to second guess him 
more and more) he treats me well, all in all.? (One particularly ann! oying 
thing is that he?likes to remind me how the "Americans" are giving lots of 
money to the Islamic fundamentalists here and doing many other things to keep 
Turkey weak, for?the most part extreme, absurd claims.)? I will at least stay 
on for the experience and the material?(I could write a book about the guy, 
though few would believe it), and to be?able to continue work on Spot On.
?
More later.? Sorry for the ragging session, but we all need one from time to 
time.? Right? 
?
Write often!
?
Love,
?
Mark????????????

Jeff,
Below are the comments from our inspector regarding the  current draw in the 
amount of $180M +/-.
?
It may  be that some of the hardware is off site and hasn't been installed as 
of the  inspection date. I'm sure Jeff can address this.
?
Call  if any questions.

It is time to begin working on planning for the Africa business trip which we 
are planning for next february.  I don't think we have a specific date yet, 
but if we can get Terrie, Dorothy, and Sherri to reserve some dates on our 
calendars and we can begin inviting customers now and based on the customer 
feedback, zero in on final dates in a month or so.  I think we should plan on 
having 12 to 15 people total attend.  Assuming 4 Enron people and 4 or 5 last 
minute dropouts, we should target inviting 10 to 15 customers.  My initial 
cut on these are below:


Skilling:

 "Billy Bob" Kriegel Sithe
 Sam Palmisano? IBM
 Scott McNealy?  Sun
 JeanMarie Messier? Vivendi
 John Bryson!!  Socal Edison
 Others?

EBS Hirko/Rice

 Mark Gilman  Blockbuster
 Don Listwin?  Cisco
 Bob Knowling?  Covad
 Alternative 1
 Alternative 2

ECM/Fastow

 Banker 1
 Banker 2
 Banker 3
 

Wrobel

 Asian Guy 1
 Asian Guy 2
 Asian Guy 3

Let's shoot for the first round of names no later that July 10, so we can 
have Terrie send out invites.  Also, Sherri,Terri - have we restructured our 
deal with the guides?

Ken

Good news,

My article will be in the Perspectives section of this Sunday's Chicago
Tribune.  The Trib's web site is www.chicagotribune.com.  They left what I
sent them largely intact.  I was especially surprised by that, since they
had said that the article would be 800 words, I gave them more than 1400,
and I believe what's getting published will be just below 1300.

I'm very excited, and deeply grateful to Tom.

Love you all,

Mark

We regret to announce that with the reduced emphasis on developing large 
infrastructure projects in certain countries, a number of individuals have 
elected to leave Enron.  Diomedes Christodoulou, formerly Chief Commercial 
Officer of Enron Broadband Services, James Bannantine, formerly CEO of Enron 
South America, and Sanjay Bhatnagar, formerly CEO of Enron Broadband Services 
for the Middle East and Asia, have elected to leave Enron to pursue other 
opportunities.  Diomedes, Jim and Sanjay built and led strong and talented 
teams at Enron.  We wish all of these individuals the very best in their new 
endeavors.

Sanjay,

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had 
several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I 
understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our 
approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what 
approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations 
that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I 
and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if 
we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it 
is cooperation and coordination is paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any 
agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better 
coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  
I am available by phone day or night.

Regards
Rebecca

Hello, Mr. Skilling! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd 
Annual Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great 
success, raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the 
fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will 
be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).

I have put together a team of Analyst interns for a second year to help in 
this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but 
I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.

I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  
Checks are payable to MDA.

FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks! Have a great day!

Tim Ng

Thanks for the reply Sherri.  I missed Jeff last night at Paul's so we
didn't get a chance to talk.  Paul and I would appreciate the opportunity to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given
everyone's tight schedules, but please find below some dates that work for
Paul and me:

Dec 11 afternoon; Dec 12 afternoon; Dec 13 10:30-2:00; Dec 15 afternoon; Dec
18/19/21 all day

Please let me know if any of these dates work so we can set a firm time.  If
Jeff wants to combine with lunch, that would be great too.  Thanks/Neil.

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Mr. Skilling,

I wanted to make you aware of the fact that I was leaving NewPower.
My last day at NewPower should be in the week to come.

Foremost, I wanted to thank you for the time you have given me while I was at 
Enron and NewPower.
This past year at NewPower has been a very intense and intellectually 
lucrative learning experience, which have brought me many skills.
My experience at both companies has been wonderful, fruitful and exciting.

I was glade to see that the NewPower/Enron Employee program faired well.

Best continuation, as President & CEO of Enron Corp and to your family.
Will look forward to the chance of meeting with you again.


Regards,
Wilson Kriegel



I have attach my resume, so you would see the opportunities and experience I 
have gained at Enron & NewPower.

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.  
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

Jeff:

This is to follow up on my conversation with you last November. At that time 
I had indicated an interest in moving from GTB in Bolivia to other job within 
Enron where I can utilize my experience more effectively.  You advised me to 
talk to Jeff McMahon at EIM because you felt my background fits well in his 
organization. Since than I have been trying to close a number of critical 
items at GTB. I am happy to report great progress. I talked to Jeff regarding 
my interest in EIM on Monday. He has indicated a strong interest in me.  I am 
looking forward to hearing from him soon. I would appreciate your support in 
this. I agree with you that EIM is a great fit for my experience. I really 
feel I can contribute significantly in Jeff's efforts in expanding markets in 
Europe.

Tom,

Thakns again for your concern.  You're asking a lot of good questions.

The best indication my building is ok is that its standing, and that it's
contemporaires are all standing as well.  You may have read that the
buildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in the
lowlands.  Mine is neither.  Spoke to my landlord today, who is an engineer
of some sort, and for what its worth he said the building is a good one.

About shots, I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF,
though he wasn't planning for one of the worst natural disasters in our
time.  I'm keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of the
diseases they're worried about here, but am pretty sure that one cirterion
is that you have to be pretty darn close, which I'm not.

I'm not our sticking my nose into anything, though would love to see things
up close for curiosity's sake.  Trouble is, I'd just be getting in the way,
which I don't want to do.  So will, for now, restrict myself to giving a
little cash and observing what goes on here on the home front.  The damage
really is not apparent from here.  As I mentioned in my note to dad, things
are pretty darn normal.  Expect indirect impact to be visable, like
worsening inflation for example.  But that's about it.  Will keep an eye out
for trouble, though.

More later.  Thanks again for taking the time to write.  Its always nice to
hear from you.

Love,

Mark

Ken and Jeff:

As you know, last year Enron produced its first ever EHS annual report with 
some mentions of our new Corporate Responsibility program.  We are producing 
this year's version, which is expanded both in the environmental reporting as 
well as our human rights and social initiatives covered.  Mike Terraso and I 
would like to include an opening letter by the two of you (last year Ken 
signed it).  Will you please review the attached and edit, comment or approve 
by next week?  We appreciate your help with this.

 Houston Angel Network members:

 HTC is pleased to present Verliant to the Houston Angel Network.
For additional information, please contact Pamela Harris, Founder, of
Verliant.

 Best regards, and as always, your feedback is greatly appreciated.

 Verliant, Inc.
  <<...>>
 Corporations today are confronted with a myriad of laws and
regulations from Federal, State and Local governments. Complying with these
regulations costs companies billions of dollars annually, in direct
compliance costs alone.   Furthermore, the risk of non-compliance is
significant and costs companies both directly, in terms of fines and
litigation, and indirectly in terms of increased insurance premiums.  OSHA,
which is only one of several compliance categories, estimates that companies
spend over $67 million annually--in fines alone.   Litigation and settlement
can cost multiples of the government fines.  Verliant has developed a
web-based, artificial intelligence tool that helps companies maintain
regulatory compliance and successfully manage operational risks. The initial
product focuses on compliance in environmental, health, safety and training.
The technology is developed and has completed a successful beta test with
its first client, Allied Waste Corporation. Contracts have been signed with
initial revenues to occur in January 2001.

 Technology & Product
  * U.S. employers face a multitude of onerous record
keeping and compliance responsibilities. The administrative burden of
maintaining up to date knowledge of, and complying with, regulatory
requirements is significant.
  * Verliant automates key management compliance
processes that were previously ignored or handled manually by employers' HR,
Safety or Legal departments.  Employers recognize significant cost savings
in compliance and substantial decreases in non-compliance.  Likewise,
productivity and the effectiveness of safety programs are enhanced.
  * Applications modules include: Human Resources
(Employee Record Management); Healthcare Compliance Auditing; Medical
Surveillance; Substance Abuse Program Tracking; Training, Evaluation and
Endorsement Tracking; DOT Driver Qualification File Maintenance; Event
Management; Accident and Injury Reporting, Tracking and Analysis; and
Industrial Hygiene.

 Market
  * There are over 6.5 million American firms that must
comply with regulatory standards.
  * OSHA estimates annual compliance costs at $33
billion.

 Marketing Strategy
  * Initial focus will be through direct sales to
Fortune 2000 companies.
  * Pricing is based on a monthly fee of about $2 per
employee.
  * Verliant has signed contracts with Allied Waste and
San-i-Pak.
  * The company plans to implement multi-tiered, direct
sales, distribution model supplemented by resellers with substantial
existing presence within niche target markets.  The company is negotiating
agreements with several resellers in both the medical and waste management
industries.

 Competition
  * Verliant has identified two direct competitors. The
first is Medgate, a privately held Canadian company that offers several
competing modules, but is not yet internet-based. The second is Complient,
which is in development of an internet-based compliance solution,
supplemented by training and safety product sales.
  * Other companies such as J.J. Keller, a privately
held company focused on the Department of Transportation (DOT) solution
only, is not internet-based.
  * A more distant competitor is PureSafety.com, which
focuses only on OSHA Training Tools.
  * Verliant is developing strategic relationships and
marketing alliances with several companies in the medical, waste management,
and PEO industries.

 Competitive Advantages
  * Management Team - The Company's executive management
skills, domain expertise, market knowledge, distribution channels,
intellectual property, and price versus performance are one of its greatest
strengths.
  * Superior Functionality - No competitors offer
Verliant's comprehensive suite of compliance rule-based solutions, on-line
document imaging, or full-service data entry and date loading.
  * ASP Delivery Model - The advantages of the ASP
include easy to use Internet based solutions, proprietary compliance rules
algorithms, and flexible reporting functions.
  * Brand Leadership - The Company's competitive
strategy will be based upon building brand awareness by virtue of its
expertise and the founder's reputation in the occupational health and safety
industry.

 Organizational Information
  Management Team

Jan Mann, Executive Recruiter, Mayor's Office. Met with her on Friday, 1/5. 
She said she had tapped into the following for potential candidates:
1. Ad placed in Fire Chief Magazine and on Firechief.com web page.
2. Announcement sent to all HFD employees.
3. Utilized Municipal Yellow pages (a who's who in the leading city and 
county governments and local authorities), targeting fire department 
personnel in the top 18 cities (based on population).

As a result of her efforts, 18 resumes have been received and were forwarded 
to me. However, when I accessed the firechief.com web page this weekend I 
could not find the advertisement (I have asked her to check on this ASAP). 
Moreover, surfing various web pages/sites related to fire 
departments/associations, I was very impressed by the International Fire 
Chiefs web page (especially compared to the Fire Chief web page) and 
suggested to Jan as well as Dennis Thompson (see below) that we try to 
advertise there as well.

As a result of my "surfing the net", I have compiled a list of decorated fire 
chiefs as well as recognized fire chief leaders on various fire related 
boards and committees. While these individuals may not fit into the top 18 
cities in terms of population, I do not believe we should narrow our search 
to this criteria. I believe what we are looking for here is an outstanding 
leader with a track record of implementing change and cooperation within the 
different divisions in the fire department. 

Dennis Thompson, Special Projects Director, Public Safety & Drug Policy. I 
met with him today at 11am. He expects to have an answer on the legal issue 
(whether I would be excluded from public access) sometime today and the list 
of HFD and consultant contacts possibly today but most likely tomorrow. 

Of special interest from our discussions are the following:

1. Internal vs. external issue 
- only one Fire Chief was from outside (Swartout) and it was a disaster (he 
lasted 3 1/2 months)
- Acting Fire Chief, Connealy, really wants the job

2. Current state of the fire department
- fire prevention (considered critical by TriData) wasn't given the attention 
needed by Tyra
- personnel fractioned - union partly to blame
- communication broken down
- low moral
- department underfunded

Please let me know if I am overlooking anything here.

It was determined by a vote of the Forum Moderators at
our meeting May 8th to form a new Forum (Forum VIII).
This decision was based on the current Forum
membership (81); the number of new members wishing to
participate; and the number of prospective members
currently in process.

The new Forum affords a unique opportunity for
existing members.  In an effort to blend the
experience of new members with seasoned Forum members,
we are looking for the following:
     a) A member who wishes to change Forums
     b) Current Forum member having 3 years or less
     eligibility remaining in YPO who would like to
     help mentor an additional Forum.

We are considering that this may give a member the
opportunity to interact with other Houston YPOers or
perhaps re-invigorate an individual's Forum
experience.

If you have any interest, please contact me by May
22nd.  Please know that all questions, thoughts, or
expressions of interest will be held by me in strict
confidence.

By way of process, the new Forum will participate in
the draw with the other Forums who have indicated they
need members.  They will select first in the order.

We trust that this process will give the new Forum an
immediate opportunity to be successful.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Jeff,

Following on from our brief discussion during your last visit to London, I 
just wanted to give you a heads-up on where we are with the Du Pont/ETOL 
steam/power deal given the discussions you and Harold had with them earlier 
in the year.  Based on prior experience in getting to closure with Du Pont, 
there is a chance that someone senior from Du Pont will put in a call to you 
or maybe Lou/Tom to express disappointment on progress and encourage Enron 
concessions, resulting in premature deal closure for us.

ETOL has tabled a blend-and-extend deal to Du Pont, in which they have shown 
interest to get to closure.  However, they just want to transact on the major 
value items for themselves now and then deal with other Enron value items 
next year in good faith.  We have indicated that we will commit Enron 
resource to get the whole deal done as soon as possible, specifying a Jan 01 
start, and will not allow cherry picking.

Whilst the overall impact to ETOL is PV neutral, the deal does substantially 
reduce long term volume risk on what is already a deep in the money deal for 
us.  The motivation for DuPont is that the deal results in immediate annual 
savings, around $3m in 2001, which fits with their corporate goal to deliver 
energy savings.

If you are called by Du Pont and need more info let me know.  We want the 
whole package from them.

Matthew

Hi Jeff,
It was good talking to you last week!  The dates for the Aspen conference
that we talked about are Sept. 20, 21,  and 22.   We would want to target

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.

Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any

Jeff,

Great to hear from you.  Things still fine in my vacinity.  Surkan and
family ok, though of course everyone is afraid, worried and sad.  The big
picture is not good.  Looks like the death toll alone will reach several
thousand, the injured over ten thousand.

Power and water back on in most of area in my area, and I believe that is
true throughout city.  Just looking at an amazing chart on TV that shows an
incredible series of some one or two dozen aftershocks, all over 4.O.  The
original one was, according to CNN, 7.8.  Some of the other scenes on the
tube are hard to believe.  I trust you'll get to see a selection of them
back there.

Thanks for the offer of help.  Don't think this disaster will be borne by
everyone, though, as it seems food, drink and everyting else available to
all but those who died.  Still, its hard not to imagine that something this
big in a place who's resources were already stretched won't result in some
serious widespread problems.  So I'll keep you in touch.

Have been composing a note to you in my head, which I will do by hand soon
and send to you with some pictures of your visit here.  Briefly, though, it
was great to see you and I am very happy that you've seen a bit about my
life here.  Enjoyed seeing Kristin and hope she had fun.  Look forward to
seeing her and the other kids soon and meeting Rebecca some day.

Say hey to all, take care and write again soon.

Love,

Mark

Some questions in advance of the 42nd floor meeting on the 16th:

Do you expect  the current crisis in California will result in an "overbuilt" 
situation for the pipelines serving California, similar to 1993-94?
It seems like everyone has an expansion proposal.

Do you expect the situation in India to be resolved to our satisfaction?


What is your projection for year-end stock price?

Mr. Skilling,

I have instructed the Security Console to not call your residence during 
late/early hours unless it is an emergency.  These instructions will be 
placed with your alarm account information as a reference for all of the 
operators.

If you have any questions or problems, just let me know.

Alan

What wonderful news for you, Jeff, and it sounds as though you will now have 
two plates full.  As a Sr. Admin, may I offer any assistance to you or your 
Exec Assistant, no matter how small, to help you in any way.  I have been in 
awe of Enron since day one for me, and I continue to revel in its successes.  
I'm proud to be here, and I thank both you and Ken (an Joe) for building this

Dear Jeff,

     I want to say thank you so much for speaking at our 2001 Deer Valley
Conference.  I know how difficult making, and then keeping, commitments
like this can be.  You are a great great friend to have taken the time to
help us out.  Hopefully it was helpful to you as well.
     I thought this year's conference was the best ever and the feedback we
have already received supports that.  We had a fascinating mix of guests
and panels and thanks to you it was a smash hit.
     Deer Valley is our premier client event and you are a premier client.
Thank you for being generous with your time.  On behalf of all my partners,
we appreciate your friendship.

With kind personal regards,




Sincerely,

Jimmy

Jeff, this message is self explanatory.? Pat Arthur of our office is "in 
charge" of selling and setting up hospitality suites for companies in Texas 
and we have an opportunity for our firm and our firm's friends to sign up 
before he "goes public".? If Enron would be interested, let me know and I 
will make sure it is taken care of.

Regards, 

Mike Buttrey 

PS? thanks again for lunch.

Subject:??????? 2001 U.S. Open 

The U.S. Open golf? tournament will be held at Southern Hills Country Club in 
Tulsa next June 11-17. 

With few exceptions the OPEN is never held this far south, thus making the 
event very accessible to those of us in the Dallas area. This will mark the 
3rd Open to be held at SHCC.

I've been asked to assist in the Corporate Hospitality for the event. Because 
of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the 
world's preeminent sporting events. To see it live , to watch the drama 
unfold in person, is an unforgettable moment. This is one reason why 
companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package. Before I put the 
word out in the Dallas market (and they will sell out soon) I wanted clients 
of MHBT to have the first shot. (I think this is a fair privilage)

The tickets to the event are sold out already, so the only way to gain access 
is via a hospitality package. They aren't cheap but the chance to have a U.S. 
Open so close might never happen again. Prices are from? $28,500 to $150,000. 
These prices range from a table in a furnished, shared pavilion to an 
exclusive environment. 

If you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and I 
will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated 
with each option. 

These started to go on sale in the Tulsa marketplace recently and several 
options are SOLD OUT, including a few over $ 500,000.

Since demand is so high and space is limited I will hold off a week before 
making non-MHBT clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime.

Take advantage of getting your best clients into the 2001 U.S. Open. 

Pat

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=

that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=

through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=

All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=

to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=

success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=

It is=20

on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=

final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20

of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.

Dear Jeff,

Enron is one of our most valued customers and a leading innovator in the
use of the Internet to enable new business opportunities in your
industry.  I believe that executives of other major companies would be very
interested in learning about the ways that you have shaped your business
and leveraged networking technology to create EnronOnline and Enron
Communications.

With this in mind, I would like to personally invite you to speak to a
highly select group of CEO's and CIO's from Global 1000 corporations at our
CEO Summit being held on April 26-27, 2001 at the Ritz Carlton, Half Moon
Bay, California.  The focus of the conference will be on using Internet
business solutions to maximize global competitiveness.  I would also like
to spend some time with you more in a one on one setting to discuss the
industry and the markets in general, but candidly, to get to know you
better and build on our relationship.

Jeff, I would be honored if you would accept this invitation.  I will
follow-up with you shortly  to answer any questions you may have and to see
about your availability.

Sincerely,
John Chambers
President and CEO

Dear Tom,

Thanks for the details.  Do they get letters about articles and, if so, do
you think I will get to see them (not just the ones they publish, assuming
they publish any)?  Can't wait to see what mom sends.  Tell her thanks ahead
of time.  I was able to pull a copy off the Internet, and it was enjoyable
to see my name in print, esepcially in such an important newspaper.  Thanks
again.

Interesting that in same section another article about Itstanbul was run,
and that in my article I mentioned the Hagia Sophia, the subject of that
other article.

Have felt an aftershock or two in the last week, but not the relatively big
one that killed a man.  And what I've felt nothing more than a little wiggle
of the earth.  (If you recall, on the morning of the big one I went back to
sleep, during which I felt lots of them (though again all not much more than
as if a truck went by the building).

Hope all goes well and you are not working too too hard (I know you're
workng too hard).  Hope we get a good bit of time together when I'm in
Chicago.  Maybe we can at least meet for grub on Sunday somewhere in near
your place.

Jeff, it would be great if you could arrange your schedule to attend IBM's
2001 CEO conference which begins with a dinner on June 12 and includes a
full day program on June 13, 2001. We plan to have 20 CEOs in attendance
and this will give you a chance to meet a few of the other senior
executives of IBM, including Lou Gerstner. Sam Palmisano will also be
there.  I've included some information below on the conference, attendees
at the last session and tentative agenda, which may help you decide. If you
can make it, Lou will send you a formal invitation letter. Please let me
know if I can provide any other information for you.

Thanks.

Gail

Dear Mr. Skilling,

You and I met last April when you spoke at a Rice Alliance event, and you
were quite kind to follow-up my request for a meeting with some Enron
contacts.  I'd appreciate your assistance again.

This week I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Lay  at the GasTech conference
at the George R. Brown while I was the guest of the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Energy. During the meeting and subsequent luncheon address, I
was amazed to hear some of the facts about how Enron has 're-invented'
itself  through the power of eBusiness, coupled with a culture anxious to
embrace change.  As I recall, statistics like 70% of today's revenues from
businesses started in the last 10 years.

The  Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) is the industry's largest event
and recently has drawn close to 50,000 participates. The General Session is
the biggest draw at the conference, and for 2001 the topic will be how
eBusiness is transforming the industry. Each of our panel members will have
5 - 7 minutes to share their own company's story then we will move into a
panel discussion mode where we will discuss the future of eBiz in the
industry, barriers to adoption and potential benefits. The following leaders
have accepted our invitation;

1) Theirry Pilenko Schlumberger-GeoQuest, President

2) Bob Peebler  Halliburton, VP of e-Business Strategy and Ventures

3) Steve Peacock  BP, VP of Digital Business


4) Linda Sarandrea PetroCosm, VP of Global Hub Operations

5) Michael LaMotte Bank of America, Managing Director

I WOULD BE DELIGHTED IF YOU WOULD JOIN OUR PANEL. Enron has obviously moved
well beyond petroleum into a number of exciting areas. As I gather, much of
your company's success can be traced to it's leadership, it's culture and
eBusiness tools. Your insights and comments would be very helpful for our
audience, as well as perhaps our other panel members. The event should be
well covered by local and national press.

Shortly we will begin our promotional campaign and would like to include you
as a distinguished member of the panel. Please advise of your interest and
availability.

regards

Art J. Schroeder, Jr.

Brother Tools,
   As of this date, I, your hard working ticket procurement master, have
only heard from Mannino, Beek, Jordan, Kretz, Wallace, Elvis, Grumbles,
Glass, C-Paul, John Miller, and Space re: ordering tickets to sit with
the
brothers of the pail.  I'm figuring I've got about two more weeks to wait
to
place the order to ensure we all get block seating, so....if you're
wanting
to sit within the Eye of Wooglin section, which, by the way, WILL OWN THE

FRICKING STADIUM THAT DAY, you kinda need to let me know as soon as you
can.
  I'll be sending this message a few more times, so get used to it
dirtballs.
    See you at the game.

Yours in -kai-,
  Drow  boethia@hotmail.com

PS.  Who in the hell bid Ricky Baier?
PSS. Feel free to forward this to any brother not on this list.

Mom,

Your letter was wonderful.  I was "transported" to Illinois and the condo,
and got a nice glimpse of your life there.  Thanks.

I hope you get a chance (or got a chance) to read Tom's and my
correspondence.  I mentioned more than once how fun it was that Tom seemed
as excited as I was.  What a rare and special happening it all was,
especially for me in that Tom was so involved.  And what a great thing this
e-mail gadget is, and that we were ALL able to experience it more or less
simultaneously.

I don't know if you kept a copy of the Perspective section, but your can see
(generally) the area where I live in the picture of Sancta Sophia on the
first page.  If you look in the upper left-hand corner you'll see a finger
of water.  That's the Golden Horn.  (To its left, starting roughly directly
above the Sancta Sophia is the Bosphorus.)  The bridge that you see crossing
the Golden Horn (we're still in the upper left hand corner) is the Galata
Bridge.  Just above the bridge, approximately half an inch on the page is
the blur of buildings where the Galata Tower and my place are.  I live in a
neighborhood called Galata (though the sub-neighborhood is called Kuledibi).
  I'll be bringing more clear pictures, but that's a start.

It IS amazing to think you all moved to condo nearly 22 years ago.  Its also
amazing to think we all moved to Illinois only some 12 years before that.
It seems like those 12 years were a lot longer than the 22 since.  Time is
cruel, I think.  Your initial experience of cold, discomfort, rang a bell
for me too.  When I moved in here it was also middle of winter (although
Istanbul winters not quite as bad as Illinois winters; more like New York I
think).  Had very little furniture (i.e. nothing really).  Ismail and I did
bag a bed and, as I half-mentioned in the article, he and his wife lent an
excellent comforter and another blanket to me.   I rely on heaters here, as
no centralized heating.  At that time, along with the bed, I had bought a
gas heater, which you're not supposed to use at night (in case there's a
leak).  So the first few nights I buried my head under the blankets against
the freezing temperatures.   Since then, have fully equipped the place (e.g.
alos now have an electric heater, which you can use at night) and am ready
(clothes and everything) for next winter.  (Also will pick up a few more
things while I'm in SF.)   All this said, wouldn't have done it any other
way.  Feel I paid a few dues and am better acclimated for the experience.

Life is considerably harder here than in America, but the good life not
inaccessible.  There is everything from Marks & Spencer to McDonalds.   I,
despite living on about $600 to 700 a month, live well and better than most.
  I calculate that, provided you don't go too far up the scale, most things
are a half to a third what they cost in SF. (Toothpaste, by the way -- even
Crest -- is here in spades.)

Have you gotten a chance to talk to Jeff about his visit?

More later, and a lot of that in person.  Thanks again for the note and
sending along the article.

Love,

Mark

Mark; I bet you are having fun showing Calvin and his friend around.  Jeff
called about a week ago and your mother and I had a nice talk with him.  It
sure was good to hear from him.
     Leigh is playing Western Illinois in Macomb, IL. in the first round of
the NCAA Class 1-AA football playoffs.  I am going down to see the game
Friday and will stay over  Saturday and come home after the game.  Al Pedrick
(fraternity brother)  works at Lehigh in his retirement is coming in with the
team and I will spend spare time with him.  Lehigh was seeded 10 of 16 and
Western is ranked 7th.  Should be a good game.  The championship is scheduled
in Chattanooga on December 16 and I hope I will have reason to go.
     I will keep you advised.   MOTHER and I send LOTS of LOVE and KISSES  
DAD

Dear Mr.Skilling

I joined Enron Energy Services several years ago as General Manager of Major 
Accounts-Mid Atlantic region. I have had the pleasure to meet you several 
times, particularly at several republican fund raising breakfast's. I believe 
Enron is a great company and destined for great things in the future.
 
As of 6/30, it will be the last day of my employment with EES. I wanted to 
say it was a pleasure working for you and I enjoyed the challenges we faced 
and the accomplishments we have made at EES over the last couple of years. I 
hope in the future we can visit if your in the Philadelphia area or if I can 
be of assistance in anyway please don't hesitate to call.

Best Regards, Frank LeMaster

Stan,

Per Jeff's request, I have forwarded the resume you attached to Philippe 
Bibi, President & CEO of Enron NetWorks.

Jeff would be interested in a tour of the building.  Would if the afternoon 
of May 8, at 3:30 would work for your schedule.  At Jeff's request, I plan on 
including Bill Donovan.

Thanks,
Joannie

Jeff,

How's it going in the world of energy?  I enjoy reading about you and your
adventures. Sounds like you might be having a little fun as well.

Attached is a resume from an acquaintance of mine.  Nice guy and would be
credit to anyone's organization.  Thought you  might forward it to
personnel.

Don't forget you've got a lifetime warranty on the drywall in your house.
My compliments.  Call me if you have any problems.  Also I walked your new
building last week.  Quite impressive, especially what we're having to
build on a tight schedule.  Should really be nice.  If you'd like a
personal tour, let me know.  I'd love to put you in a hardhat and introduce
you to the team that's doing all the work.  Would make a great shot for my
in-house publication and maybe yours as well.

Miss seeing you at our Forum meetings.  WPO is not as much fun as YPO.
Enjoy it while you can!

-Stan

Hi Stan:

It was good to meet you this morning. I've enjoyed working out with Joel;
he's a good "kid" and I can certainly relate to his Midwest roots and Iowa
State background. I grew up on a grain/livestock farm in Gladbrook, Iowa, a
town of under 1,000 people, and did my BS at Iowa State and MBA at Kansas
University.

I'm currently working as Director, Business Development at RedMeteor.com,
an
internet-based energy brokerage company. We compete against Altra Energy,
EnronOnline, InterContinentalExchange and HoustonStreet. We started with
$22
million in venture capital, but need an additional infusion of capital to
build out our business model. I think it's going to be difficult for us to
attract additional funding in this climate, so I'm interested in making a
move to another employer when I find the right fit.

As I mentioned this morning, I've been talking with Conoco recently (my
previous employer for 9 years) as well as Enron's Broadband Services group.
I'm looking for a Houston-based business development position that would
build on my eCommerce experience at RedMeteor or my oil & gas pipeline
operations background. I've also met with Reliant Energy recently although
I
understand they've suspended hiring in their trading/eCommerce groups due
to
the California crisis.

Any suggestions you would have would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.

Rebecca: 

These meetings that were set up with Pawar in Delhi were supposed to be 
attended by Wade but but he was unable to attend them due to the fact that he 
fell sick. No agreements have been reached because there are none that are 
contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the GOI 
for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the other 
memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I finished 
sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different than what 
we have been following all along and I believe that  you know that already.  
If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this with you or if u 
want to follow a different strategy then please let me know. I am at the 
Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.

Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge immediately 
and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I agree that 
this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are moving, I think 
that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately over the weekend 
so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and start transitioning 
the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the team in delhi as soon 
as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have urgent commitments in Mumbai 
that require my presence there.

As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential for 
you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and developing 
the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the train and if 
we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down and assist 
them in any way we can. 

regards,

Sanjay

Sanjay,

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had 
several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I 
understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our 
approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what 
approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations 
that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I 
and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if 
we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it 
is cooperation and coordination is paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any 
agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better 
coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  
I am available by phone day or night.

Regards
Rebecca

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=

      Dear Mark;  Thank goodness the election is almost over.  We ought to
have a few weeks of peace before someone will start working for 2004.
      The poles have been swamped today and I guess they expect the biggest
vote in the last 40 years.

     I am glad the election is nearly over------after almost 2 years I have
heard enough.
      I got a new tooth inlay this morning and then voted about 10:45 and
already our precinct had had over 180 voters--your mother was one as she went
before she went to the store.  I don't know who she voted for as yet. I was
thinking of putting up some cute sign like (Monica says "Back Bill"); (Nader
says "A vote for me is a vote for Bush"); (Be sure to get behind the right
Bush);(Gore is a Kunkle Head); or (Gore - Gore).  However I decided to put my
halo back on.  You realize I am joking of course.
      I watched the Northwestern-Michigan game last saturday-it had to be the
most exciting college game I have ever seen.  NW lost the ball on downs when
their star runner (he had gained 268 yards running) dropped a pass in the
endzone with no one within 10 yards.  All Michigan had to do was run the
clock down (1:45 left in game) so I turned to ESPN to try to get a Lehigh
score ( I finally did) and I never went back to the NW-Mich game.  I learned
just as I turned the radio off to sleep about 8 hours later that NW had
recovered a fumble and scored on a pass to win 54-51.  NW had beaten
Minnesota the week before on a Hail Mary pass  of 50 yards on the last play
of the game.   Incidentally Lehigh had beaten Colgate 20-14 and they are now
9-0.
     I know you are looking forward to seeing Calvin.  I wish I could be a
mouse to see that meeting. I had better leave now.  Your Mother said I should
send her love.  I add my love to that.  DAD

Jay,

I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is 
little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" 
right - just give me a call when you've got something.

Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.

Best regards,
Jeff

Subject: My Resignation, and a Question

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley 
about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily 
for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, 
while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it 
is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I 
will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term 
Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital 
community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future 
payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some 
very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to 
cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think 
that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if 
I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer 
enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned 
professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this 
note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too 
presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not 
wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep 
up the great work!

Jay

Attendees:

AT&T:  David Dorman,  President of AT&T (bio points below)

Enron:  Jeff Skilling, Stewart Seeligson, David Cox

Adventis: Partha Ghosh, Andy Belt and Mark Bruneau (via telephone)


Background:

As you well know, over the last 9 months EBS has made substantial efforts to 
establish a significant commercial relationship with AT&T.  Thus far, there 
have been no transactions between EBS and AT&T other than a couple dozen of 
circuit purchases by us mostly local loop.  Previously, our primary senior 
point of contact with AT&T has been Frank Ianna (President of Network 
Services).  It is probable that Ianna brought only the typical legacy 
perspective which prevented him from seeing how we could facilitate the AT&T 
business from a wholesale relationship.  They seemed to only want to sell us 
services.

Adventis advises us that Ianna now reports to David Dorman and that Dorman 
should be able to better understand the value that EBS can bring to further 
his business objectives.  It is my understanding that it will only be Dorman 
at the meeting (he is supposedly not bringing Ianna).  I view this meeting as 
a worthwhile shot to see if it is worth pursuing AT&T at all for the balance 
of the year for a big transaction.  Dorman's positive receptability to us is 
the only reason I can see to spend significant resources on AT&T in the near 
future.


EBS - AT&T History

Jun 2000 EES sponsored Executive Briefing with focus on EES and EBS - 
attendants include Frank Ianna from AT&T.

Oct 2000 - Extensive EBS team meets with extensive AT&T team to set up eight 
tactical and strategic working teams to find opportunities for the   
companies to build a bilateral commercial relationship.  After three weeks, 
results were presented to executive committee of both teams. Nothing 
materializes.

Potential Opportunities

AT&T currently spends a significant amount each year (expected to be in the 
$100s of millions) on offnet services (wholesale expenses) .  EBS would like 
AT&T to allocate a potion of the purchases towards EBS.

Adventis states there are currently numerous major undertakings by AT&T which 
are transforming the telecommunications operations at AT&T.  Is there not 
something EBS could do to help advance these undertakings?

At a minimum we would like AT&T to interconnect to our pooling points.


Final Note

I do not think we should lead with trading.  We should lead with our ability 
to provide services to the wholesale sector of the industry. The typical 
reaction we get from incumbent players is that if they don't trade or if they 
think that trading puts downward pressure on prices, then they should not do 
business with Enron.  They need to understand that they don't need to trade 
to have a valuable business relationship with  Enron

Howdy everybody,

I've cut and pasted in below a piece that should be published in the Turkish
Daily News (the English language paper here) later this week.  It's a first
person piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, a
lot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeating
myself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to get
it out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fell
during the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.

Happy holidays,

Mark-O

*  *  *

     Christmas Day, Istanbul


     The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,
which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronounced
words rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.
They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earth
to die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,
the story sounds strange and almost subversive.
     And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christian
and Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent by
God, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed's
prophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistaken
elevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.
     The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,
in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing a
big, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announces
that we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and in
English, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyrics
are basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?to
come?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorly
translated chorus, which asks for the Son of God "to come will be born in
our heart?.
     I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to the
service.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I am
sure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in the
sanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first service
of the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italian
and a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, will
overflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consist
mostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently some
members of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, since
many of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even being
forced to stand out in the cold.


     Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month of
Ramadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,
or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one can
discern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during the
ninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solar
calendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started well
before dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who was
roaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.
  Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummers
have been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A tradition
originating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is to
rustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal before
the sun comes up.
     Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the year
for Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which some
say influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Total
remission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I have
been told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all the
Turks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with what
I have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell me
they fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling all
sorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they are
significantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, many
of the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful and
eat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbing
a simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning and
eating them on my way to work.


     Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in the
States.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enough
Catholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really much
too strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little more
than an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local Presbyterian
Church (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with my
twin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often struggle
for the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemed
susceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to see
if any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.
     The priest has returned and is now saying something about light being
shown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeat
that light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinite
darkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given that
I am so far from what I am most familiar.
     A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.
The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I lean
over toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids under
his breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,
straighten back up, listen to the song begin.
     There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes a
while for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomes
particularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As if
something ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space that
envelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  I
am moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel a
tear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the people
here are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to be
reminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that is
itself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the first
time since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.
     The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to take
communion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that we
walk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there I
am surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,
who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonder
where they might have been hiding.
Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,
swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  An
older woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.
The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.
With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder how
she can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at least
pretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.
     The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about the
church, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not want
to be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return to
my seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, so
incongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view all
this, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other in
such an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions have
come up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?


     This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live here
will be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhaps
exchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shots
heard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,
pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, the
Iftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, where
special Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- at
least to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques and
the hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls to
prayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.
     Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleep
under the same black sky.

"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not." *

 * Translation from the Bible.

"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!
The compassionate, the merciful!
King on the day of reckoning!
Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.
Guide Thou us on the straight path,
The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are not
angry, and who go not astray." **

 ** Translation from the Koran.

A summary of today's Houston Chronicle article blasting the Mayor after 
Lanier taken to the hospital in paramedic SUV.

" Heart scare sends Bob Lanier to hospital"

Summary:
Lanier's defibrillator went off
wife called 911
first responder fire engine at the scene in 6 min
SUV arrived 2 min later, or within 8 min of call
"estimated" arrival time of an ambulance, 2 min later, or within 10 min of 
call - both of the City's downtown ambulances were at hospitals on other calls
Mayor Brown gave the okay to transport Lanier to hospital in SUV

Implications:
Not enough ambulances downtown and Mayor has plans to close both downtown 
fire stations with a temporary station to cover the downtown area until new 
station built (3-5 years)
purpose of SUVs is to free paramedics from transporting patients to hospital 
so can respond to EMS calls more quickly (not to mention that SUVs are not 
equipped to transport a patient)

Mr. Awano,

Per your recent request to Dr. Kitatani, we have contacted Mr. Idei's Office 
to
find out his travel plans to the US in June.  Unfortunately, we were informed
that he is currently not scheduled to be out in the West Coast in June, and
therefore, will not be able to meet with Mr. Skilling at this time.

However, we were also informed by Mr. Idei's Office that he would be more than
happy to meet with Mr. Skilling during his next visit to Tokyo.  Therefore,
please keep us posted on any future travel plans to Tokyo that Mr. Skilling 
may
have so that we may assist you accordingly.

Thank you and should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

Best regards,

Ann Rubin

February 10, 1999

I am wakened by the approaching chatter of the early morning call to
prayer (sounding a bit like the fuss made by one of those cartoon balls
of fighting dogs and cats).  From the minarets of far away mosques, the
muezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys and
streets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,
squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, a
miserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the local
muezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds us
that God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important than
sleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).
Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simply
listen, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back over
me.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitches
itself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and I
argue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out of
reach.

Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd their
way into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which means
there's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before I
douse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself of
the theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated with
sleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fear
I am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for something
worth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages of
a quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when I
really get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I really
do have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my English
lesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably made
any more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.

                               *     *     *

My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internet
server, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.  Hope to attack
that backlog of responses that are due.

Keep in touch.

Mark-O

Thank you for stopping by the Boardroom yesterday to congratulate me on my 
college graduation.  It is due to Enron that I have been able to achieve this 
lifelong goal.  I have also received unfailing encouragement, support, and 
flexibility from Cliff during this time.  Had it not been for Cliff, I would 
not have been nearly so successful.

My deepest thanks to the three of you.

Someone posted the idea that we remove some pictures because it was
getting sort of messy in the picture folder.  We still have lots of
storage space and since many of the brothers are still getting their
first view of eWooglin.com I think we should keep all the pics. They
are listed in alphabetical order in the folders.

I took the liberty of moving all the pictures into folders. So just
post any new pictures in the top level folder "Pictures" and you can
find all the others in the lower level folders entitled "golf"
or "football game" etc. If you want to post the pictures directly to
a sub-folder, that's perfectly OK too, because the email notice that
is automatically sent when you upload a picture file will send us all
the right place. But casual browsers looking for new pictures may not
think to look into the sub-folders.

To navigate back out of a lower level folder just click on the
word "Files" in the left hand column. That puts you at the top of the
folder directory and you can then click on "Pictures" again.  That
puts you back to the newest pictures and all the other picture files.
Sorry if this slows down getting to around to all the files. Looking
at the pics by staying within one folder is still the fastest way to
see all of them.

I'm sure if you don't like this solution, you'll let me know. There
are no shy Betas.

Thanks for all the great pictures and commentary. It's a joy to see
your stuff when I take a break at work from trying to "Enable the
Information Age [tm]."

Dear Mr. Skilling:

I'm contacting you to let you know of an exciting opportunity to speak
at the Spring 2001 InformationWeek Conference to be held April 1-4,
2001, at the Ritz Carlton in Amelia Island, Florida.

Each year, the editors of InformationWeek choose a theme for the
conference that brings to life our editorial point of view -- the very
reflection of developments and trends in business and IT.  This year
our theme is: "Radical Simplicity: The Drive to Conquer
Complexity and Enhance Customer Value." E-business has
revolutionized the global economy. But it's also built complexity
directly into the very technologies that were intended to facilitate
business among companies and their customers and suppliers. As the
technologies designed to link more partners became more complex, so
too did the business processes for which they were used.  This
Conference will highlight the drive toward simplicity ? in technology,
in business models, in business processes, in corporate culture, in the
economy. And in the very way companies interact with their
customers.

Based on the role you and your enterprise are playing in your industry
segment and from our recent coverage of Enron, we know that this
fundamental concept, driven by technology, is helping your
organization redefine itself to build better customer relationships and
face new competitors in today's fast-changing economy.  As such,
we'd like to invite you to speak in a session at this Conference.

Our semi-annual InformationWeek Conference is a unique blend of
professional development, research, and peer-to-peer networking. If
you're able to participate, you'll be joined by close to 500 other senior
IT and business executives, in addition to other industry experts. With
your contributions and those of your peers, The InformationWeek
Conference truly is like a special issue of the magazine come alive!

We hope that you'll be able to attend. I, or one of my colleagues, will
be calling to discuss this speaking opportunity with you in the next
week.  Best wishes and we look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely,



Brian Gillooly

Beta Thursday Night Gang,
?
Significant progress has been made in our quest to locate an alternate  venue 
for our Thursday night rendezvous.
?
The suggestion actually came from Queensbury, NY of all places.? Yes,  
brother Rob Rossell ('77) has volunteered his brother Bill's  
establishment....Lakewood Landing.? Tom Benson says it's near Stan's Blue  
Note Inn.
?
A brief description, details and directions will follow.
?
I spoke to Mike Arends today...it looks like Mike will be joining us in  
spite of the fact that he will be at the alter 2 weeks later.? Rob Rossell  
tells me that Tim Strange is coming down with Harry Singleton.? The  brothers 
just keep on coming out of the woodwork.? Rob Bugh got into the  loop only 
recently- too late to make plans to leave the flock behind.
?
Though he's become a silver-gray, his hand keeps time and measure...check  
out Elvis doin' the hambone thing (attachment).? A Beta Top 40 included  too! 
(don't worry Jansson, I still have my day job)
?

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the "truth").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a "special" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ronnie Morgan

Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17 acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

To quote Johnny Thunders "All Dressed Up.... I got nowhere to go".  If
anyone wanted the definition of "Window Dressing" just pull out the charts
on Friday's trading.  Money managers don't want to look bad at the end of
the Quarter so -  bid the stock up at the close to inflate your portfolio.
In the last 30 minutes the Nasdaq gained 60 of its 88 points; the Dow
Industrials gained over 100 points to close up almost 50 and ditto for the
S&P 500 which gained 14 points to close up 12.... As the million share "buy
at close" orders flowed, volume boomed and stocks lifted. (GE, which closed
up 2 5/8, had three million shares to buy on the close).  In Tech - CSCO,
EMC, HWP, MSFT, ORCL all up over 3% joining in the dress up party - one tech
biggie not joining the fun - IBM down 4% on negative comments.  In the CEUT
Universe: FTLK* popped over 8 on positive news of a collaboration with MSFT
- it ended the day in the red but over 7.... PSDI* down over 5, MANU* up
over 3.... SSTI* up over 12 after blowing away their #s, PSEM* down 5....
JDSU* up over 3... BRCD* up over 6, NTAP* and PRCM* up over 2 1/2 and CPQ*
gained some ground from yesterday - up 1.....PROX* and RIMM* up 6.... MUSE*
up 15, VRTS* up over 7... TMPW* up over 8... SIRI+ up over 2 pre-launch,
PGTV+ up almost 5... JBL* up almost 3.. ICGX* up almost 1 1/2...In IPOland -
PRSE was up 50% - let hear it for enterprise management software! EXFO up
68% - lets hear it for fiber optics! but STOR was up 234%!!!!! - lets really
hear it for storage networking!!!!!! On the downside - NTES - Chinese net
co. fell 20% (there was a time a few weeks ago when the combination of the

June 23, 1999

Home,
A sort of honor, not a building site,
Wherever we are, when, if we chose, we might,
Be somewhere else, but trust that we have chosen right.

W.H. Auden

The view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of red
tiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other side
of the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalled
and polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to be
called Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly six
centuries before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear of
apartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlines
of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.
I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the
1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman the
Magnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered by
the before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but already
appearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, I
suppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far too
little and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about the
relevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybe
thousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip and
rise in the air space between me and all of that.

I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)
from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my window
while playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --
slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  This
evening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by Steve
Earle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long ago
love ("Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?") and one by Lucinda
Williams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget ("When I get
to Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you").  A pile of clouds staacked up
on the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sun
still makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch the
neddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappears
behind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be heading
in that same direction.

What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've ever
developed particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that is
not to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore San
Francisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora
(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it would
have been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,
I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,
I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convince
myself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling down
in one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of my
life is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all might
lead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --
loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'm
just looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I've
found it.

My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home after
what was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sure
about the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) I
accosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but they
tried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the first
time I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on a
post-dusk walk through the "working class" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on our
way to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the Suleymaniye
Mosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularly
poorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in near
total darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasional
flare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first not
knowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passing
near a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely important
institution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have been
told) have no showers.

Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha and
Nina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while suffering
through the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of most
significance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine months
apart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  During
one of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordy
never-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building and
lasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when I
suggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood space
between an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.
Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understand
department.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.

This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan on
studying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles and
writing and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb more
deeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, including
an incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this old
dog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where to
lay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is
"hearing" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are "Ne dediniz [What did
you say]?" and "Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?".)  I
will be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television is
an important way to learn how to "hear" Turkish.

Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writing
program, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.
("Insallah [With god's help].")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and my
reading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least I
should be sending a few more e-mails.

More later.

Mark-O

Jeff,

Hope all is well with you. I'm just dropping you this note to let you know I
haven't forgotten your call concerning the sale of your share in the Rio
house...I've been extremely busy getting my immigration status in order and
setting up my company in London.

I've also asked Price Waterhouse to update all the accounts of Swanswalk Ltd
in Ireland (the company that owns the house) and see the best way forward
for a potential transaction seeking to minimize Brazilian and Irish taxes.

My personal matters should take me a few more weeks and I will contact you
to discuss the house shortly thereafter.

Regards,

Diomedes.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Dad and Mom,

Enjoy Alaska, dad.

Thanks for keeping in touch.  By the way, will be in SF starting late
October 21.  Unfortunately will have to spend quite a bit of time I'm afraid
finding new tenant, as the old one (who's been great) is moving out after a
year.  Wish me luck.

Keeping pretty well informed here.  Don't expect things to get too bad, at
least in the sense that I'll be suffering any serious deprevations.  This is
a big, cosmopolitan city (perhaps, in some ways, the most cosmopolitan city
in the world), which in many ways is quite modern (in its own, primitive
way).  Its got plenty of McDonalds, for instance, at which I can (Allah
forbid) stiffle any hunger pangs.  My friends Ismail and Sukran are looking
out for me as well, and for example talked me into staying out doors for two
of the three nights following the quake.

Its raining now and has cooled down considerably, which is great for me but
a very mixed blessing for those trying to get things somewhat back together
east and west of here.  Wish them luck. God, what a horrible thing.  Just
horrible.  I feel guilty that things in my life so normal.  And things
really are, for all practical purposes, back to normal.  How strange.

Say hey to mom.  Have heard little from or about her recently.  Is all ok?

Love,

Mark

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

Dear Mr.s Lay and Skilling

Thank you; I just received my t-shirt and letter regarding the Chairman's 
award nomination.  I was really flattered to have received that mention.  The 
traits sought by the Chairman's award are those I would really like to 
exemplify; respect, communication, integrity, and excellence.  To even have 
been considered worthy is exciting and humbling.  I know that truly most 
people at Enron hope to display these values, and for you to have designed an 
award to recognize them is really inspiring.

In short, it meant a lot to me, to have been mentioned for the Chairman's 
award within a company of which I am so proud.  I know it will mean a great 
deal to the person I will seek to nominate, when I next have the opportunity.

Thank you.
Sincerely,
Julia Cobb

No Beta reunion weekend would be complete without the Beta Brunch at the
Benson=01,s.  We will be serving Sunday Morning from 9:30 AM until we kick
the last Beta out of the house.  The menu is still being prepared, but
rest assured that there will be some good Zodiac vodka around the house
for Bloody Mary=01,s, Screwdrivers, Martini=01,s, Jello Shots or whatever i=
t
takes to erase the pain from three days of partying.

Below is a photo of C-Di enjoying some of that Benson Beta Brunch
hospitality.

Shoot me an e-mail and let me know asap  if you will be hanging around
for the brunch.  (Directions to follow)

Tom

Resumes - We currently have a total of 10 "live" resumes - where "live" 
indicates individuals who fit most or all of the qualifications/attributes we 
are seeking in a candidate.
 - of the 10 resumes, 4 originated from the City's initial recruiting efforts 
and 6 have been received since Enron became involved in the efforts. However, 
to date, no resumes have been forwarded from Recruiters. 
Recruiters - Unfortunately, I have had to take control of this situation by 
force. It appears we will no longer seek assistance from two of the three 
executive recruiters, Preng Assoc and Kern & Assoc. Korn Ferry has been 
contacted directly by me and redirected down the correct path. Hopefully we 
will have some resumes shortly.
Meetings/discussions with related parties - I have met or had telephone 
conversations with a total of 8 individuals. I expect to meet with six more 
over the next couple of weeks. I plan to ride with Dr. Persse, the medical 
director, on 1/28 and to spend an entire shift (24 hours) with the 
fire-fighters from District 34 - the result of a two hour meeting with a 
Chauffeur (who initiated the meeting after reading the bulletin 
Hollingsworth's office sent out on me) who invited me to spend 24 hours with 
his fire station to experience first hand what they do. (I understand that 
one of the men who posed for the 2001 Fire Fighter Calendar are in his fire 
station - JUST KIDDING!)
I have a lunch planned for tomorrow with the Mayor's communications director. 
She will be handling the specifics of the news conference scheduled for Febr.

Dear Jeff Skilling,
    Thanks so much for your involvement in the search for a fire chief.
Having suffered the lack of competent leadership this department has
experienced during my 20 year career, I offer these comments respectfully.
    This is an organization of unique people with a unique mission. Those who
lead these people need not be mission specialists but must be true leaders of
people. Because of the way fire departments grow their leaders from within,
leadership is not a quality that evolves. Authority is used in its place.
Firefighters are taught to rely on themsleves in high tide, and they do not
naturally seek information and ideas from others. Because politics won't
allow the department to operate in a similar fashion to the Marine Corpse,
authority is less than useful at the top: leadership is essential.
    None of the men who have headed this department in the last 20 years have
understood the difference between leadership and authority. They have
commanded, but not led. The importance of this difference becomes evident
once one is familiar with the problems addressed but not improved.
    The people in this department who raise their own flag high enough to be
recognized as potential chiefs do so being driven by  a combination of greed
and ego. They campaign for the job because they want it, not because they
think they can do a good job. When they take the fire chief's job, this ego
does not allow them to lead talented people. It directs them to command and
to control.
    The second major element of failure, when coupled to this egomaniacal
command style, puts the incompetence in motion. As was extremely clear with
the last chief we had, no ego check , no alter ego, no reality check was ever
allowed. None of his people were allowed to express any oppositional views or
to suggest anything differing from the chief's ideas. A true leader will more
than listen to his opponents on any issue or idea. He will welcome differing
views, knowing they might influence him in a positive way, even if only to
preserve his image as almighty. In our department we have consistently seen a
style of live or die by the chief's wishes. It's not what's best for the
citizens that comes to the fore, it's what makes everyone remember who's in
charge. I know this sounds bitter, but it's as true as it is
counterproductive.
    The above described syndrome has contributed enormously to the failures
of leadership we have seen. This department has made many mistakes laughable
to organizational psychologists, fleet management experts, and most logical
thinkers inside the department.
    This department's current state is much more problematic than Mayor Brown
either recognizes or is willing to admit. There are many troubles which make
the rank and file veterans see a terrible failure of this department to carry
out its mission in the near future. Recent status reports, though harsh, have
been too kind.
    With a leadership style in any way similar to our record, we're in
trouble. We need a leader who can address the problems we have as a
department instead of using their energy and resources to protect their own
status, to explain why problems exist instead of how they'll be addressed. We
need someone with the vision, the intellectual breadth, to see the department
as a function of society. We need someone who has some experience in the
outside world and who understands that all relevant and useful knowledge is
not already held by our department. We need someone who can recognize talent,
good ideas, and put them to use. Someone who knows what a leader means when
he tells his assistants to speak their minds, that he can agree with himself
and doesn't need them for that, but that he needs their input especially when
it differs from his own. Someone who understands and appreciates the
scientific model for solving problems, and who sees the organizational chart
with the bottom at the top so that the leaders are there to support as they
direct. Someone who leads people to do the right thing because they want to,
not because they have to. Someone who will say that things are not all right
and here's what we're going to do to improve them.
    Perhaps you will keep an eye out for these qualities and we might have a
real leader for a change, instead of just a chief.
    Thanks again for your work on this and good luck.

Jeff,

We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the 
numbers you have 
requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on 
the power situation in India
published by The Financial Times. 

The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting 
millions of people.
One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due 
to  power
shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost 
of power produced
by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230 
million people.

The second article is Enron specific.

                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India 
                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By ANGUS DONALD

                     Tens of millions of people were left without electricity 
in northern India
                     yesterday after a power grid breakdown. 

                     Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and 
most parts of the
                     capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply 
expected to be restored
                     by the end of the day, according to power grid 
officials. 

                     The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(Assocham), a
                     leading business organisation, expressed "deep concern" 
and called for a
                     mechanism to prevent future disruption that could 
"cripple the economy". 

                     The power failure across eight Indian states, including 
New Delhi, disrupted
                     train services, water supplies and the telephone network 
and forced
                     hospitals to switch to emergency generators. 

                     The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides 
electricity for 226m
                     people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana, 
Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,
                     Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu 
and Kashmir. 

                     A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, 
India's most
                     populous state, caused an overload of power on other 
lines, which then
                     failed as well. 

                     Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals 
systems were
                     damaged. New Delhi international airport was also 
slightly affected before
                     its own power supply could be engaged. 

                     "We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is 
most likely to be a
                     technical failure, but we will investigate why it 
happened," Suresh Prabhu,
                     the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust 
of India. 

                     India suffers regularly from power problems because of 
lack of funding to
                     upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big 
problem. Thirty per
                     cent of the country's electricity is stolen, according 
to analysts. In New
                     Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen. 

                     Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh 
and Delhi for
                     hours. 

                     Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing 
industrial demand
                     would exacerbate the problems already faced by India's 
inefficient power
                     sector. "The slow progress, particularly in 
strengthening the transmission
                     and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will

                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Energy group launches image offensive: 
Enron has a
                     plan to reverse its reputation as a profiteering 
multinational
                     operating in India, writes Khozem Merchant 

                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By KHOZEM MERCHANT

                     Enron, the US energy producer and a constant target of 
criticism in India, is
                     hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a 
profiteering
                     multinational. 

                     Its "myth and reality" offensive in local newspapers 
follows the west Indian
                     state of Maharashtra's decision to review the tariff it 
pays the Texas-based
                     company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating 
plant at Dabhol is
                     India's biggest single foreign investment. 

                     Maharashtra's tariff has more than doubled since 1993 
and is three times
                     greater than that charged by other independent power 
producers (IPPs).
                     The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the 
rupee against the
                     dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha 
fuel. The state also pays
                     a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month, 
reflecting the
                     huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of 
consumption. 

                     A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six 
years ago that
                     damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former 
official of the World
                     Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is 
emerging "as the East
                     India Company of the 21st century" - a reference to the 
British trader that
                     colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th 
century. 

                     The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power 
sector. The UK's PowerGen
                     and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently, 
frustrated by long approval
                     procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of 
higher
                     returns elsewhere. 

                     "India has lost time and opportunity and has driven 
returns down by six
                     percentage points," says Gerry Grove-White, former India 
general manager
                     of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat 
to China Light &
                     Power of Hong Kong. 

                     India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says 
generating capacity
                     must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since 
1992, IPPs have
                     added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under 
construction. This is
                     insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 
per cent economic
                     growth. 

                     Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation, 
winning fast-track project
                     approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant 
fuelled by expensive
                     naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a 
Dollars 1.87bn plant
                     of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied 
natural gas (LNG),
                     will be completed this year. Only two of seven other 
fast-track proposals
                     have achieved financial closure. 

                     From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating 
in Maharashtra's
                     then nationalist government cancelling the project 
before renegotiating
                     terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister 
of the successor
                     government, says the power purchase agreement is 
unaffordable. 

                     Enron, whose attackers also include cultural 
chauvinists, wants to maintain
                     good political relations in a hostile but lucrative 
environment. Enron views
                     India as a testing ground for its evolution from a 
traditional manager of
                     power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities, 
such as energy, gas
                     and bandwidth. 

                     To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy 
between power
                     surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed 
this year. It is building
                     an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural 
gas. And it is
                     laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth 
space in a country
                     desperately short of this new economy commodity. 

                     In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight 
contract. It is supported by
                     many that believe any subversion of the contract would 
confirm investor
                     perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and 
industrial hub, as an
                     unreliable destination for investment. 

                     Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his 
predecessor, which
                     threatened to "dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea" - is 
under pressure from
                     radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options 
are limited.
                     Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an 
economically troubled state
                     that would have to compensate shareholders. 

                     Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility 
and Enron's main
                     client, is obliged to dispatch or "off-take" 90 per cent 
of Dabhol's output. Yet
                     MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take 
has averaged 60
                     per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has 
been paying a lot
                     more while consuming a lot less power. 

                     One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough 
new regulator has
                     told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the 
tariff would be
                     Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But 
with off-take a
                     third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and 
often higher. In
                     October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take 
was about 49 per
                     cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2, 
run on cheaper
                     LNG, starts. 

                     These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only 
half of a 30 per
                     cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the 
balance and
                     mandated bankers to find a buyer. 

                     Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs, 
which have failed to
                     deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared 
they would never be
                     paid by state generating boards that have become a 
byword for corrupt
                     management of power. 

                     Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic 
pricing means
                     industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as 
transmission and
                     distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and 
technical losses, is
                     overdue. "Given the limited resources, money would be 
better spent on T&D
                     rather than on new plant," says Oliver Blackaby, 
managing director of N M
                     Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the 
privatisation of its
                     distribution network. 

                     For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to 
satisfy the
                     competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay 
Bhatnagar, chief
                     executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade 
magazine, one of the
                     key lessons learned from phase 2 is "having flexibility 
to deal with
                     externalities".

The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe=

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20

they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=

Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide=20

Mark,  

Jeff is considering taking Jeffrey on an African safari July 4-13, and was 
wondering if you would have any interest in joining them.  He is in the 
process of gathering information now and has not yet committed, but wanted to 
guage your interest.  He's looking primarily at the Ngorongoro conservation 
area and the Serengeti.  I can forward a proposed itinerary to you once 
received from the guides.

Please let us know if you're at all interested.

Thanks, Sherri

Tom,

Reading thourgh my mail and came to your newest note.  Thanks again for the
communication.

Like I said in earlier note, things seem pretty normal.  Stores without
electricty, but open.  No one seems to be hoarding.  Indeed, except for lack
of electricity I really wouldn't know anything happened, and I walked around
for a couple hours, covering some ground.

It was strange, but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night and
probably only did so minutes before the quake.  Next couple hours was spont
outdoors with the rest of my neighbors.  Took a pretty good walk then, too,
and again saw little damage (though admittedly it was the middle of the
night).  The one good thing is that for the first time in my stay here the
stars were all out, as the city had gone dark.  Quite an experience.

More later,

Mark

Jeff,

I emailed you a couple of weeks ago regarding my interest in Harvard Business 
School and I wanted to follow up with you.  I am going to be in Houston on 
December 11, 12 & 13 for business and I was hoping that our schedules meshed 
and I might be able to come by to say hello.

I hope we have an opportunity to meet in December.

Best Regards,

Jeff,

As per Paul Trieschman's suggestion, I am contacting you in reference to 
Harvard Business School.  I am a Manager with ENA in Denver who has come up 
through the Analyst/Associate program and I am planning on returning to 
business school next Fall.  If you had a moment, I would appreciate the 
opportunity to discuss my background with you, as well as pick your brain on 
the experiences you had while at HBS.

Best Regards,

Bruce Rudy

Dear Neil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he will be at Paul Hobby's open house this 
evening and hopes to see you there to discuss Genesis Park and Vitol.  In the 
event you two do not cross paths there, please let me know and we'll see what 
we can do to schedule a meeting before the end of the year.

Subject: Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17 acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Howdy,

West is best, I guess, (and apparently now more ethnically mixed?)

Trip to Washington sounds great.  Once when I was there, maybe 5 or 6 years
ago, I had the opportunity to visit a congresswomen's office, as I knew an
intern there.  Was, among other things, escorted to the Capital
building(through tunnels that lead under the Mall from the various office
buildings to the Capital building) where I saw a few hours of a
Congressional debate on one of the many campaign reform bills that have
passed through those (not so hallowed?) halls.  The debate very interesting,
not the least reason being that it was made before only a couple dozen of
the 500 or so congresspeople (the rest, I was told, were monitoring the
debate on TVs in their offices).  At the few times that a quorum of the
members actually have to be present (for, say, an impeachment vote), a bell
rings and congresspeople hustle through the above mentioned tunnels to
register their vote, after which they hustle back.  It's something to see.
Good luck with the application.

YOU MUST, while in DC, see the Holocaust Museum.  I Mean MUST.  Should make
reservation (probably can use the Internet), as I understand it's booked up
far in advance.  The museum's right off the Mall so is conveniently located.
  The most powerful museum I've ever been too.

Turkish course finishes in two weeks.  Then to Israel during first week of
April, to Italy during second week.

Bursa was very impressive.  Not nearly as dilapidated as (most of) Istanbul.
  Was the first capital of the Ottoman Empire, so there are important
historical buildings from, among other centuries, the 13th.  Now, a bit of a
sprawl, and industrial. The city center sits at the bottom of the slope of a
huge mountain (its ragged, snowcapped peak breaking out of the clouds
periodically), and thus there are fine views in both directions.

More later,

Love,

Mark

Mark, I have a letter here that Jeff would like to mail to you (we still 
haven't gotten him to use e-mail yet!); however, I don't have an address for 
you.  Please let me know if you have a mailing address in Istanbul, and I'll 
get this in the mail right away.  Thank you,
Sherri

Tom,

Below is Bill's latest response, and the edit.  They made very few changes.
How about that.

It strange to think that right now, as I write this, you are on the set at
WGN, in the middle of the news program, perhaps putting a few finishing
touches on your graphics.

Just as I got up a few minutes ago (I got up early, which is the best time
to get through to the line I share [and also because I'm excited[), and at
the exact time I turned on the computor there was a flash of lightening
outside.  Then, moments later, just as a healthy downpour began, the muezzin
started singing outside.  (This is true, no lie.)  I thought to myself I
hope there aren't any more cosmic coincidences (such as a ..., well you
know).

I'll be on line for a bit, so maybe we'll be able to "talk" on this thing
almost as if in person.

Love,

Mark

Houston Fire Chief Selection Committee Members: Jeff Skilling - Chairperson, 
Troy Blakeney, Gerald Smith, Roel Campos and James Duke.

Congratulations selection committee members! We have a very important and 
exciting task ahead of us. 

On the agenda for the next week are two important items - (1) the Mayor's 
February 1 news conference announcing the Houston Fire Chief selection 
committee and its members; and (2) coordination of an action plan, which we 
should work out prior to the news conference.

News Conference specifics:
speakers - Mayor Brown and Jeff Skilling
in attendance - all selection committee members
location - Fire Station #6, 3402 Washington Ave.
date - Thursday, February 1, 2001
time - 2pm
duration - approximately 30 minutes

I'd like to emphasize that it would be ideal if all selection committee 
members were present at the news conference. 

I will need bios on each committee member emailed to me by close of business 
Monday, January 29, 2001. These bios will be attached to a press release the 
Mayor's Office is compiling.

Coordination of action plan:
Since we have only 1 week between now and the news conference, Jeff has 
proposed that he take a stab at putting together an initial draft. He will 
then email to all committee members for comments/suggestions and make changes 
accordingly. Hope this works for everyone - if not, give me a call 
(713)-345-4840.

Thanks,
Lisa

Dear Mr. Skilling,

website I was a little disturbed.  This is an idea I have been trying to=20

help with other, EBS, initiatives while I developed this idea. =20
Unfortunately, no one seemed to be interested in pursuing this opportunity=

till now; however, it seems to me that we are now interested in pursuing th=
is=20
and therefore I would like to ask that I be given an opportunity to fully=
=20
pursue and develop it.  I am attaching a small presentation that I had=20
developed to present to Mr. Dimichele=01,s group.  In this presentation you=
 will=20
see that I am not only looking at storage as a traded commodity but several=
=20
other features of the Internet that will be traded in the future.  The reas=
on=20
I am bothering you with this is because I only saw your name mentioned in t=

this.  Please consider this e-mail confidential.  Thank you.

Again, Kevin, thank you.  I look forward to seeing you in April.

Joe, because there seems to be some question whether EECC ever pleases its 
Enron customers, I wanted to pass on to you the compliments of ENA ( below) 
on the Doyle Georgia Power Project, which is nearing completion.  Just FYI.

have done a great job meeting the many challenges imposed by the project and 
that ENA is very appreciative of their fine work.  -  Just wanted you to know.

Thanks,

Rick,

This is disturbing.  I can not understand how an HR employee for an Enron 
business unit can deny access to what appears to be an Enron auditor on the 
grounds that the records being sought are confidential.  As you know Sanjay 
reports to both Ken and myself in support of EBS Asia activities as well as I 
believe McDonald for Global Assets.  Given this split accountability, and the 
fact that I do not know which business unit these records apply to, you as a 
representative of Corp should probably require that Enron be given access to 
these records as part of your audit responsibilities.  If you think it 
appropriate for me to make the request I will be happy to do so.

Kevin

		 Subject: India Internal Controls Assessment & Review and Cash Controls 
Standards

India Management,

We are in the process of conducting a follow-up of the Internal Controls 
Review that was conducted last year at EIPL.  We are also conducting a 
compliance review of the Cash Controls Standards that were recently issued by 
Enron Assurance Services.  On November 3rd, we informed Milind Laad, EIPL 
Controller, and Carol Howes, Sr. Dir. Fin. & Acctg., that we would be 
conducting a visit to EIPL to perform the follow-up Internal Controls Review 
and a Cash Controls Standards audit.  An Internal Controls Review entails 
reviewing not only financial areas but other departments such as legal, IT, 
operations, etc.  

We started our testing late last week and were informed that supporting 
documentation for certain accounting transactions reside in HR.  We then 
scheduled a meeting with the head of HR, Sandip Malik, to request supporting 
documentation for the transactions and other information that is more 
relevant to HR as part of our Controls Review.   Mr. Malik denied access to 
the records on the basis that they are confidential.  Apparently, not even 
the Controller has access to some of the supporting documentation.  Mr. Malik 
stated that we needed to give him a request list, so he could clear it with 
Sanjay Bhatnagar.  We informed him that we could not give him a list but 
needed general access because we did not want to go  back and forth with 
lists given my limited time here in India and logistical difficulties in 
communicating with Mr. Bhatnager.  Mr. Bhatnager apparently was on vacation 
and now is travelling to Houston.  Given the time difference, I am requesting 
that Mr. Bhatnagar or one of the upper management executives responsible for 
India send a communication to Mr. Malik and instruct him to give me access to 
the Enron Records.  

I apologize for the inconvenience, but I had not previously experienced the 
situation where I was not given initial access to the records.  I am also 
interested in obtaining access to the payroll records for Arthur Andersen so 
they can test the project allocations developed by HR.    



Thank you,


Juan Camarillo
Manager
Enron Assurance Services

For years I followed the positive contributions ENRON made to the community 
and its staff.  I always dreamed of working for a company that truly cared.  
My prayers were answered.  I am proud to be a part of this team and look 
forward to many years of prosperity and success.  After working for a private 
practice for 10 years and being told that the corporate work environment was 
impersonal, I have seen ENRON promote and display respect, integrity, 
communication and excellence.  If someone gives respect, the person receiving 
it might build up their self-esteem and in return respect others.  Being 
honest gains trust and sometimes trust can be more valuable than money.  
Without communication, walls are built and eventually tumble down hurting 
everyone/everything surrounding them.  I really applaud your vision on 
communication.  Good communication is the main ingredient in every view of 
life.  Keep up the good work.  Striving for excellence encourages people to 
work hard, utilize their creative minds, explore new areas, and learn to 
adjust to change.  

Thank you again for allowing me to be a part of such a GREAT team.

Hello Jeff,

I hope you are well.
Below is a background on our firm.  As you will see what characterizes our

is their current or recent experiences.  Many have already rolled out into
industry as well.

Hawkes-Peers & Co. is an executive search firm based in NYC, specializing in
identifying opportunities for top-tier consultants from the top strategy
firms-McKinsey,  Bain, BCG, AT Kearney, and Booz Allen, who are looking to
move into the corporate sector.  These candidates also share the common
qualification of an MBA from one of the elite business schools such as
Harvard, Wharton, Sloan, Kellogg, etc.  Our focus targets this network of
individuals on an ongoing basis, keeping an active portfolio of these
management consultants from which we can draw for appropriate opportunities.

The emergence, growth, and continued vitality of Hawkes-Peers are a direct
result of the increased demand for strategy consulting professionals
throughout the United States.  Our intent is to identify and re-position
only those professionals who will enhance and build quality organizations;
and to adhere to high professional and ethical standards that serve the best
interests of our clients and our profession.

Our extensive network can allow your organization to be highly selective and
save you invaluable time.  We can give you the ability to select amongst the
most talented strategic, operations, and management consulting
professionals; and build strength in the future of your company.

If you have an interest in the pool of talent that we represent, I would be
more than happy to provide you with more information.  Additionally, I can
send samples of our past introductions as well as resumes provided with
permission from the candidate.

Sincerely,

the hammer (so to speak!) on some of your people to sign up.

Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke 
with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in 
financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set 
relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also 
interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; 
likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of 
the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am 
highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston 
through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any 
opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone!  He looks 
just like his son Jeffrey Jr. in this picture!

I never was able to open the document that was sent twice, which I believe 
had all the details.  I know that there is a party Friday night at Elvis' 
house, but I don't know exactly where that is; and I know there is a football 
game at 11:00a on Saturday, but I'm not sure whether or not Rocky will be 
able to attend.  His significant others' sister is getting married the night 
of 28 Oct, so he must be back in Houston for that.  We'll get him a corporate 
aircraft, though, so he can come and go as he pleases.

That was probably a very long answer to a very short question!  At any rate, 
if I could get the details for the party Friday night, I would really 
appreciate it.  In the meantime, I'll find out if Rocky is planning to go to 
the football game Saturday.

Mark,

I am pleased to report that everyone has been working extremely hard to
collect all of the information that has been requested (and then some) for
purposes of the upcoming due diligence visit.  I believe that Brian will
find everything most interesting and exciting.  While discussing the current
situation with Awano and Seguchi we touched upon your initial reaction to
our valuation and came upon a fundamental realization.  Because we have as
yet not shared any of the financial projections for Mutsu Ogawara or Ube
with you it is not surprising that you would  be unaware of how much value
we truly believe we have in these projects.  Recognizing that Enron will
need to review and evaluate the assumptions we have utilized I still wanted
to share some fundamental numbers with you in order to put this value into
perspective.

Taking the Mutsu Ogawara numbers alone and discounting them to a financial
closing date at the end of 2003 (utilizing a 15% discount rate) results in a
Net Present Value of US$848 million. In other words, if we were to flip this
project at financial close it would be worth at least this much.  Using a
discount rate of 10%, still considered very high for a Japanese investment
return and likely attractive to many Japanese investors, the value is in
excess of US$1.5 billion.  Looked at another way, discounting the NPV back
to 2001 at 15% results in a current NPV of $558 million, or more than $34
per current EnCom share!  Assess any reasonable probability factor -50% or
33% - and you still get $11 to $17 share.  Our assumptions were developed
conservatively and are quite defensible.  As an example of our conservatism,
we incorporated 300 MW of simple cycle combustion turbines into the Mutsu
Ogawara Project capital costs to provide peaking or backup capacity and yet
included zero revenues from this capacity.  Therefore any value attributable
to this additional 300 MW represents pure upside.  This also includes zero
upside from any marketing of natural gas into this gas deficient part of
northern Japan.  These numbers may be hard to believe but we are comfortable
that your due diligence will bear them out.

More exciting is the fact that the Ube economics are even better.  Looking
at just these two projects and placing a ridiculously low 20% probability of
success on them together with the $3 per share of cash on our balance sheet
gives you nearly $20 per share current value.  This is without considering
Oita or any of the other many projects we are currently working on. This is
why I was surprised by your reaction to our valuation.  If Enron, with all
of its significant resources and experience, were to fully support EnCom on
these two projects we believe that the probability of their success would be
quite high. (We have been receiving excellent support from the Global LNG
Group by the way) This is also why I would suggest that we focus our
immediate attention on these two projects together with perhaps the Oita LNG
Project.  It will prevent your team from becoming stretched too thin and may
accelerate your ability to come to a conclusion with respect to valuation.
I think that we would agree that reaching a conclusion as quick as possible
is in all shareholders interests.

My main concern continues to be that the current infighting between Enron
Japan and E Power has limited Enron's ability to recognize 1) the quality
and significant capabilities of the employees of E Power and 2) the
significant value that has been created through the nearly 2 years of
systematic and comparative analysis of all of the potential greenfield sites
in Japan as well as the significant progress with respect to brownfield
developments.   I am hopeful that your due diligence team will quickly come
to understand this.  Within the next six months we expect to be able to take
off of the market nearly three quarters of the most attractive development
sites in Japan leaving little for the late comers to the Japanese market.
We continue to hope that together we can find a way to focus our mutual
energies on building value in this exciting market rather than on
non-productive bickering and turf wars.

Sincerely,

Bruce Wrobel

Where mountains touch Big Sky
And clear waters amplify
A transient souls request
Does Montana meet the test? ? ? YUP!

In Southwest Montana snow capped peaks feed clear mountain lakes and streams. 
As these high mountain water sources merge in the lower valleys they foster 
more stunning scenery and create the Madison River ecosystem.

This magnificent watershed nurtures fish and wildlife habitat of unequaled 
splendor.

You are invited to join us at the 2000 YPO Montana Experience and indulge the 
outdoor adventure of your choice. Horseback rides into the Spanish Peaks, fly 
fishing on the Madison, white water float trips via the Bear Trap
Express and upland bird hunting at the Diamond Wing Hunting Reserve are but a 
few of the options available. Couple all this with real Montana hospitality 
reflective of a cultural heritage rooted firmly in the traditions of the Old 
West.

Dates for the YPO Montana Experience are October 5th-8th, 2000. For more 
information and registration check out the Montana Chapter website:

Howdy.  I wrote the following last month while I was in Northern Cyprus.
Hope you enjoy it.

*  *  *

Maras, The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus -- Attached to the rusting
chain-link fence I am approaching are several blood red signs, on which are
stenciled both the black silhouette of the top half of a faceless soldier
holding a rifle and a warning, in Turkish, that "Fotograf Cekmek Yasaktir
[To Take Photographs Is Forbidden]".  The fence, no longer quite plumb in
the soft sand, seems to stumble across the beach, eventually ending at a
gently lapping Mediterranean. There a tangle of wires attached to the fence
extends a short way into the surf, making anyone's effort to outflank it
obviously intentional.  The Turkish soldiers patrolling the non-man's land
beyond, to the south, could thus treat such an intruder, I suppose, in
whatever way they might see fit.

In the other direction, the fence, before it has completely left the beach,
cuts sharply north, running in front of the hulks of four empty resort
hotels.  Above them in the deep blue of the pre-dusk sky hangs a crescent
moon, the same phased moon that graces the flags of both Turkey and the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  One of the hotels still has the
remnants of an identifying sign, with just two of its six letter Greek name
remaining.  Another hotel, the smallest and no doubt at one time the
quaintest, has slatted wooden shutters covering the windows and doors
leading out to tiny porches.  Some of the shutters have rusted off their
hinges then fallen forward against the porch railings, and now point out to
sea as if giving urgent warning.  Others hang limply, defeated, from a
single remaining hinge.
Most surprisingly, every one of the windows I can see in the hotels is
either missing or broken.  I am taken back by such thoroughness, given that
the most likely motivation was vindictiveness.  I struggle to find a loftie=
r
one, wondering if there was perhaps some valid security consideration, such
as making these somewhat strategically set buildings unattractive to
squatters.  Maybe -- though I find this thought the most troubling -- it ha=
d
been done just for the fun of it.





The fence I am walking along marks the border between inhabited and
uninhabited Maras, the Turkish Cypriot's name for the town Greek Cypriots
call Varosha.  The uninhabited part has been off limits since the Turkish
army invaded Cyprus in 1974.  Before that invasion the small Turkish Cyprio=
t
minority had lived uneasily amongst the Greek Cypriot majority, though in
the years since 1960, when Cyprus was given its independence by the English=
,
periodic outbreaks of inter-communal violence had led to increased
segregation and emigration.  The invasion, launched after a coup on the
island and another particularly vicious spat of violence, eventually put an
end to even this limited association -- as it did the worst of the violence=
.
  The Turkish army went on to occupy roughly the northern most 40% of the
island, which was accompanied and followed by one of the last century's all
too familiar mass cross-migrations.  The northern "half" is now home to
nearly all of the island's Turkish Cypriots, close to 20% of the total
population.

The border between the north and south, known as the Atilla Line, is one of
the many UN patrolled "blue lines" in the world.  Maras actually falls
within Northern Cyprus, with the Attila Line further to the south.  It is
controlled now by the Turkish army.  At the time of the invasion the town
had been a thriving, up and coming resort town, run mostly by Greek
Cypriots.  Indeed, all over Cyprus, since its independence -- despite the
periodic, deadly violence -- tourism had been booming.  But here in Maras,
at least, the boom is no more.  The forty or so thousand Greek Cypriots who
once owned, ran or otherwise worked there, fled in panic before the
advancing Turkish army, reportedly leaving behind uncleared breakfast dishe=
s
on tables and washing on lines, some forgetting to turn off lights that
burned on and on for years.

UN sponsored "proximity talks" between the North and the South  -- called
proximity talks because the negotiating leaders will not met face to face -=
-
started in New York on December 4th.  They are set to continue in Geneva
this January 31st.  The return of Maras to its former mostly Greek Cypriot
owners, or more precisely their return to it, is no doubt high on this
meeting's (thus far secret) agenda, as it has been over the years at the
many similar, though always fruitless, negotiations.  This time around,
however, expectations are running higher than usual, primarily because of a
positive change in the dynamic between the two side's by far most important
sponsor states, Turkey and Greece.  Turkey, for example, has recently
acquired candidacy status within the European Union, which commits it to
resolving among other things its disputes with EU member Greece.  Greece, o=
n
the other hand, has lately suffered a series of embarrassments on the
international stage, the biggest of which was being caught last February
having given sanctuary to fugitive Kurdish separatist leader -- and
terrorist in most people's minds -- Abdullah "Apo" Ocalan.  Coupled with th=
e
significant good will garnered in the wake of the tremendous assistance
Turkey and Greece gave each other after their twin earthquake disasters las=
t
year, the two countries just may be willing to push their client states
toward a deal.





The point where the fence meets the sea marks the end of the gentle curve o=
f
the short beach I am walking.  Behind me, at this beach's other end, is
inhabited Maras' nicest hotel (oddly sporting an English name, the Palm
Beach Hotel).  If you looked in that direction, taking in only the fine
hotel, the attractive beach, the dark blue sea, you might think you were in
a tourist paradise.  But this is no paradise.  As I walk the last few feet
to the fence I begin to see another beach emerge, much longer than the one =
I
am on, sweeping south most of the way to the horizon.  There are more
hotels, which I knew from what I had read were also empty.  But my reading
has not prepared me for the monstrous proportions of it all.  First, in the
distance, one, two, three empty hotels quickly come into view, then, more
slowly, dozens more.  At the fence, with the entire beach now visible, I
count more than thirty of them, and these just on the waterfront.

Just beyond the fence are a few pieces of ancient playground equipment
scattered about the sand.  I try to imagine the happy cries of the children
as their parents, more than twenty- five years before, pushed them round an=
d
round in dizzying circles on the miniature merry-go-around, now rusted and
partially buried by drifted sand.  There is a long slide too, though
half-tumbled down, one of its rusted supports having twisted and collapsed
after so many years of weather and neglect.  My own memories of childhood
end at no such place now trapped inside a militarized no-man's land.  How
different life must seem to those whose memories do.  What sorts of dreams
are built on this type of innocence lost?

I turn around and walk to the Palm Beach Hotel, along the way wondering if
it was merely luck that had left it on the business side of the fence.  On
its porch I chose a chair, since it has become cold, near a partly cracked
door through which comes a warm draft.  I order a cup of tea.  As the
evening grows darker, so does the abandoned town spread out before me.  The
crescent moon is now higher in the sky and, together with a strategically
placed star, provides a tiny bright exclamation point over the entire disma=
l
scene below.

At that moment two energetic young men burst through the door.  The bigger
of the two is gripping the arm of the other, directing him forward to the
porch's railing.

"Bak [look]!" he says in Turkish, gesturing out toward the sea with a broad
sweep of his free arm.  "Harika, degil mi [Wonderful, isn't it]?"

"Evet, cok guzel [Yes, very beautiful]", his friend agrees.

They stand gazing out over the sea, though after a brief moment I see the
smaller man's head turn toward the darkened hulks that line the shore.  The
bigger man glances at his friend, sees where he is looking, then looks
himself.  They are both silent for quite some time before the bigger man
returns his attention to his friend, squeezes his arm.  His friend, as if
awakening from a trance, slowly pulls his gaze from the ruins, smiles up at
his companion.  After two identical, simultaneous shrugs, they chuckle
uneasily, shaking their heads as they do.

When they turn to return to the door, I holler out to them. "Baris mumkun m=
u
[Is peace possible]?"

They stop, look at me with frowns of curiosity.  "Nerelisiniz [Where are yo=
u
from]?"  It is the big one who had taken the lead.

"Amerikali"yim [I'm an American]."

His frown deepens, though now for a different reason.  "Belki dort, bes yil
sonra [Maybe four, five years from now], belki hic bir zaman yok [maybe
never]."

"Ama, ne hakkinda otuz bir ocak, bir yeni baris gurusmesi [But, what about
January 31st, the new peace negotiations] =01(?"

"Hah!" he exclaims, interrupting me. "Her zamen yeni baris gorumesi var
[There are always new peace negotiations]!"

He thereupon dismisses my inference with the same sweeping arm gesture he
used to introduce, to his friend, the sea.

Howdy,

Enjoyed reading about Dad's and Dave's recollections of Macomb.  But why is
Macomb in their pasts?  When was/is the Delaware game?

Things are ok here.  Have lost a bit of respect for the Firm I am working
with; lots of bluff where there should be preparation; dreams of glory
without the sweat.  Still, I am being treated great.  Second newsletter sent
out last week; with Ismail's help (I got him hired to work with me on the
layout, as the in-house guy not really up to par) and the look much much
better this time.  I like a couple of the articles too (note the one on
international arbitration and the micropower revolution), though the
audience for them is probably pretty small.  Will definitely be sending this
one to some editors.

Today a bit blue, and walked down to the Bosphorus for of a dose of
"renenwal" by the water.  Got treated to the last of the day's sun catching
both the tops of the (most ugly, except in sunlight) building's lining the
strait's Asian shore and the sterns (right Dad?) of huge tankers heading for
the Black Sea.  Because its Ramazon, and sunset is when everyone breaks
their fasts, I had the quay mostly to myself.  About a mile up the Bosphorus
is a huge suspension bridge, and between its towers was a huge rising full
moon.  Nice scene.

What's up with you all?  Tomorrow is the presenation to our most important
client, Turkcell (on the NYSE).  Is a Power-Point Presentation, the modern
version of a slide show, with audio.  I wrote it and recorded it.
Unfortunatlely, radio vocies don't seem to be inherited traits.  (Indeed, I
do recall Tom working to train his for hours and hours; nothing biological
about that, just hard work.)  Tomorrow night its off to Georgia again, where
I have a little work to do and will (the main purpose for the trip) pick up
my work visa.  (Will stay a few days, despite not having that much work to
do there, and do a bit of sightseeing; might not get there that often in the
future, as once again the Russian's seem to have less than honorable designs
on the place.) Upon my return to Istanbul, the work visa should be followed
in a couple of weeks by my residence permit, at which point I will be legal.
  No more touris visa run every three months!

More later.  Look forward to some new news.

Yours with love,

Mark

Dear Mr. Schaeffer,

Apologies for the delay in responding to your e-mail below.

Jeff has given your proposal serious consideration.  However, given the 
current demands on his time, he has decided to decline your offer to join the 
Cogent Communications Advisory Committee.

On behalf of Jeff, many thanks for the opportunity and best wishes for 
success.

Dear Jeff,

Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke
when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent
Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last
year.

I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company
composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth
of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am
looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The
commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in
the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola
and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan.

Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet
access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the
latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide
network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate
of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at
www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date
with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas
Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners.

Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to
speaking with you and catching up.

Sincerely,

Dave Schaeffer, CEO

IDC's Flagship Event:
 The European IT Forum 2001 - 11th Edition
 Grimaldi Forum, Monaco, 17 and 18 September
 "Old and New Worlds Collide in Europe: Will Business Take the Leap?


 Dear Mr. Skilling,

 Business  leaders,  market  players  and media representatives who attend 
IDC's
 European  IT  Forum  each  year  rate it the most prestigious and 
authoritative
 eBusiness conference in Europe.

 Past  speakers  at our Forum have included global business leaders such as 
Bill
 Gates,  Larry  Ellison,  Scott McNealy, Tim Koogle, Michael Capellas, Sir 
Peter
 Bonfield;  Economists  and  Technology  Gurus  Nicholas Negroponte, Gary 
Hamel,
 Jeremy  Rifkin,  George  Gilder,  Geoffrey Moore; Venture Capitalists, 
Bankers,
 eBusiness Stars and the most senior IDC analysts.

 Although  we  are  still  several  months  away  from this year's event, we 
are
 pleased  to  confirm the participation of the following industry leaders: 
Carly
 Fiorina  (CEO  of  HP),  Michael  Capellas  (CEO of Compaq), Jeff Bezos (CEO 
of
 Amazon.com),  Joe  Tucci (CEO of EMC) and the "gurus" Gary Hamel, Lester 
Thurow
 and Michael Porter.

 The key themes this year will be:

 -   the Internet stock crash and current economic slowdown
 -   how Internet technologies can help overcome the present financial 
downturn
 -   how the economy of established companies and the new order of dot-coms 
are
 merging
 -   how companies can formulate winning strategies by combining the Internet
 with traditional competitive advantages
 -   how Europe can take advantage of current favorable market conditions to
 catch-up with the US
 -   how investments in Internet infrastructures and eCommerce will drive a
 major economic development worldwide over the next decade

 We  would  be  honoured  if  you  would  accept our invitation to speak at 
this
 important event during the breakout session entitled: "eBusiness Strategies 
for
 Brick & Mortars"that will take place on Monday 17 September at 16.00-17.30.

 We  anticipate  a  select audience of CEOs and board-level delegates as well 
as
 columnists  from  key  European publications, as well as TV and other 
broadcast
 media.

 We hope that you can accept our invitation to present your vision of the 
future
 of the internet economy at IDC's European IT Forum.

 I look forward to hearing from you soon.

 Best regards,


 Roberto Masiero
 President IDC EMEA

On Thursday neither the Dow Industrials or the Nasdaq saw green... what was
particularly surprising was there was an expectation that end of month widow
dressing would carry us up for the close of the week - maybe this bodes well
for Friday - if there is any action expect it in the morning as traders
leave early for a long holiday weekend. (Tues. is the July 4th holiday and
Monday is a short trading day). In tech generally - UIS tumbled over 30% on
negative talk going forward and numerous downgrades, CPQ* (Compaq Comp) down
over 11% on analyst comments, EMC (EMC Corp), IBM ORCL (Oracle) all down 2%,

Semiconductor) down 6%, GTW (Gateway) SAP (Sap Aktiengecell) and ADI (Analog

and HWP (Hewlett-Packard) down 3%.... there were a couple of bright spots -

(Brocade Communications) up over 3 1/2, PRCM* (Procom Technologies) and
NTAP* (Network Appliance) both down over 4, PROX (Proxim) and RIMM*
(Research In Motion) down nearly 4 (RIMM* continued to tumble in after hours
trading after they came in inline but there were negative rumblings on the
call), NUHC* (Nu Horizons) down over 1, MERQ* (Mercury Interactive) up 2,
MUSE* (Micromuse) up over 6 (continuing rise), VTRS* (Veritas Software) down
over 9, TMPW* (TMP Worldwide) down over 3, DISH* (Echostar Communication) up
over 2, GILTF* (Gilat Satellite) down 3, GMH (General Motors H) up 3 (on the
rebound), SPOT* (Panam Sat) down over 3, WCII* (Winstar Communications) down
over 2 1/2, COVD* (Covad Communications) down over 1. In IPOland some were
up strong, some weren't - Capstone Turbine (CPST) tripled after coming at
the top of the upward range - the company makes parts for power generators
and electronic vehicles.... Accord Networks (ACCD) - the Israeli realtime

Gentlemen,

Thank you for the letter memorializing my nomination for the 2000 Chairman's

received many promotions, cash bonuses and commendations during my career but 
I consider the recognition as a nominee for the 2000 Chairman's Award to be 
the most significant acknowledgment of my performance ever received.  My 
compliments to you for making Enron one of the most successful and excellent 
companies on the globe.  I only wish that I could contribute more to Enron's

Sincerely,

> HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) on Wednesday named Jeffrey K.
> Skilling chief executive to replace Kenneth L. Lay, who said he will step

> Skilling, 47 years old, will take on the new role on Feb. 12, the

> Lay also denied rumors that he was interested in becoming U.S. secretary

> a Bush cabinet."
> "I am particularly happy that Ken and I will continue running the company

Dear Jeff,

I have attached for your review the following documents related to InterFit
Health.com:

1. InterFit Health Business Plan Summary.
2. Investor list from our recent offering.
3. Investor letter concerning Sept. and Oct activities.

The current  shareholders are composed of Founders 61%, Mischer Healthcare
Services 17%, Round I investors 21%. I personally purchased 14% of Round I.
The investors purchased a convertible preferred and the company may not
incur debt without consent of the preferred holders so it is in effect a
first lien.

The company is initially focused on health screening through blood testing
but I anticipate adding other product lines such as radiology next. The
vision is to become a corporate and consumer full service diagnostic site
with medical records storage along with referral capability to healthcare
providers in major urban markets.

There are several characteristics that interested me in InterFit:

1. Empowering consumers and corporations to take controol of healthcare
management.

2. The confluence of aging baby boomer demographics and their requirements
of diagnostic testing.

3. Application of technology to enable the company's clients to access lower
pricing at their convenience vs the physicians schedule.

4. The rapid growth rate of gene based testing. Quest Diagnostics performs
six million gene based test annually with a current growth rate       of 50%
per year.

5. To date there are no direct competitors taking the integrated approach to
diagnostic services.

If you have a interest in investing we would be pleased to have you as a
shareholder. The average investment per holder in round I was $75,000. We
will have a second round closing in June 01.

Enron has used InterFit to provide health screening several times between
1995 and 1999. As we discussed my view is that corporatioons have always
approached screening as a employee benefit but never were given a integrated
solution. My approach is to provide the employee/dependants diagnostic
services, a referral solution for out of range results and storage of
historical medical records. The corporation will receive a generic data base
mapping the health of their employees which can be used to predict disease
and truly risk measure the population. Obviously this will be very useful in
negotiating managed care provider contracts on your actual data versus
getting dumped into their huge data base.

InterFit will be able to address the North American market at launch in
January 2001. The answer to your question regarding England/Europe and South
America is that we need to set up laboratory networks and provider networks
but it can be done.

In closing, I believe Enron would benefit significantly from participating
in our program but it will require senior management committment to a long
term program to reap the benefit of healthcare cost containment.

Thank you for your interest and I will look forward to hearing your
thoughts.

Sincerely,

Walt

Guys, we are working to put together the final team to manage this issue; 
however, it isJeff Skilling's call to keep Delainey, Milnthorp and Keohane 
out of the day to day fray on this issue.  I believe this is the right call.  
Commercial and legal resources from Houston will manage this issue on a go 
forward basis and may call on you as a resource if needed from time to time. 
You have done a very great job managing this issue to date and your efforts 
on that front are much appreciated.  Our focus should return to growing the 
business and meeting our financial targets.

Peter, I believe that Mark H. would like you to stay involved through the 
Friday conference call that is scheduled.

Regards
Delainey

Thanks for hosting the breakfast and for emphasizing the importance of the=

other companies in the mid-stream natural gas industry.  As I was listening=

I share that information because I have seen both sides, the worst and now=

some of the criticisms of the process were both very important.  I will tak=

I appreciate being selected to be on the committee and look forward to=20

Dear Mr. Paul,

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who asked me to let you know that he 
will send you a check in the amount of $200.  

While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you 
might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's 
2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He 
has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the 
MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16, 
and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be 
matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150 
team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is 
$350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that 
goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my 
family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so 
actively support research to find a cure.

I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends 
his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a 
nice weekend.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

To All Brother Beta's (and El!!),  3 weeks ago Woody Berry and I took a trip
to Rockford, Illinois to visit Phil Morrow, who has been struggling with MS
for the past 12 years.  The pictures tell the rest of the story.  I would
say that speaking for Woody that the trip was very bitter/sweet.  Bottom
line:  count your blessings, we never know what life has in store for us.

I will be hosting my Annual MS Walk/ Party in May.  I have done this for the
last 10 years.  I initially thought it would be a good thing for me to do as
I thought I had MS!!  Fortunately, my Neurologist thinks that I had a small
stroke back in '91 (never thought having a stroke would have been GOOD
news!!).

Now, I host the party in honor of Phil Morrow in hopes that we can find a
cure to help him.  As always, I collect donations from anyone and everyone
who is interested and/or able.  If you would like to send in a donation,
simply write out a check for whatever amount to:   NMSS (National Multiple
Sclerosis Society) and send it to:

Chuck Paul
6193 Forest Hills Dr.
Norcross,  Ga.  30092-4513

My email address is listed below.  If you have any other Beta's who you
think would like to see these pictures, please forward them on.

PS  First game at the new Ford Stadium on the SMU campus will be 9/2/00 at
6PM against KU.  Homecoming this year will be October 28th.  The new stadium
is looking GREAT!  I hope to be at both games but definitely at Homecoming.
Hope to see many of you there.  We will even have a 'tailgating' section
with 'adult beverages' allowed!!!

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting 
firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the 
survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for 
contributing to this important learning opportunity.

To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and 
simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron 
Company Code, which is: 

C673EV

To begin the survey, click on the link below:

Thank you.

Subject: Re: Maharashtra Plants  

Jim,

I have the list below with the information I have:

Ghatghar  Don't Know
Tata Hydro  Hydro
Koyna   Hydro
Koyna IV  Is a pump storage project, but am not clear on fuel, probably uses 
electric pumps during off peak.  Primary purpose is likely irrigation.
Khaperkheda  Coal
Koradi   Coal
Chandrapur  Coal
Parli   Coal
Uran   Domestic gas, currently in short supply
Trombay  Nuclear
Nasik   Coal
Bhusawal  Coal
BSES   Coal
Dabhol   Naphtha, converts to LNG with Phase II

Additionally, please note that there is no other liquid fuel fired power 
plant in Maharashtra, aside from Dabhol.  The Reliance Patalganga plant is 
still under development and this would be naphtha based when completed, but 
it is not clear that it will go ahead.  There was a scheme to develop liquid 
fuel fired medium sized projects in many states, including a bid for 9 such 
plants in Maharashtra.  None of them are likely to see light of day.

In short, DPC cannot replace any other oil fired plant in Maharashtra with a 
higher heat rate.

Hope this helps.  I will be back in Mumbai next week.  Please let me know if 
additional information is needed.  I am available at 011-91-9821068238 when 
in India.

We are starting the data collection and ratification for the Henwood study in 
earnest, and I am having there representative in India also on Friday.

Regards,
Sandeep.

FYI
FirstWorld announced the company would not meet its projections for the next 
3 quarters and the resignation of CEO Sheldon Ohringer.

The stock is trading at less than $4.00 per share (near our original basis).  
We sold 80% of our position for $10.55 ($130 million).  ENA still holds 3 
million warrants.

Dear Jeff:

    Thank you again for extending me an invitation to be on your committee to
select the new Houston Fire Chief.  I look forward with much enthusiasm and
excitement to working with you and the committee members on this very
important project.

    I enjoyed our visit at the Doubletree immensely. It was great walking
down memory lane and recalling our days in Cambridge. We probably passed each
other at Harvard Square at some point during our time there.  As I said, I am
a great admirer of you and ENRON. The innovation, creativity and unique
(though soon to be widely copied) business plan make ENRON one of Houston's
(and the nation's, maybe also California's in the near future) great assets.

     Since the subject came up in our conversation, I will add a short
personal note. After reviewing several potential transactions this week, it
is quite possible that my partners and I will be entering into a "business
defining" transaction in the next two months. Since I am a lousy golfer, I
will be exploring new challenges.

    Thursday, at the fire station, should be fun. I can see you and the mayor
in one of the hook and ladder trucks for the photo op.

Take care,

Roel

Hello --

A quick summary of key e-market/exchange progress over the past couple months:

1)  i2 network proposal submitted:  $20 million over a 36-month term -- U.S.,
Bussels, India.

2)  Financial Settlement Matrix launched:  120-day pilot -- EBS, i2, Citibank,
Wells Fargo, S1 Corp. --  EBS has 18% stake -- no significant revenue this 
year.

3)  i2 and IBM sponsoring EBS in MyAircraft.com (aircraft parts exchange) and
iStarExchange (Toyota private exchange):  rough estimate of initial network
business in these exchanges is $3 million annually (grows as exchanges grow) 
--
early discussion stage.

4)  i2 and Nortel sponsoring EBS in e2Open.com (high tech exchange with lots 
of
visibility, IBM is also a key player):  in early discussion stage.

5)  Ariba wishes to pull EBS into the Ariba Commerce Services Network (ACSN):
initial network proposal from EBS will include San Jose and London with Tokyo 
to
follow as soon as available -- rough estimate is $10 million over 36-month 
term
-- Ariba is also open to a proposal on hosting services from EBS.

6)  Lots of other business development in various stages, including Commerce
One, Oracle, Tivoli, BMC, and multiple exchanges and exchange technology
providers.

The good news is that the EBS pitch has been impressive to potential customers
and partners (see attached presentation for a sample).  We are pitching 
network
services successfully (the VBN product is key), but it is clear that the Enron
financial services skills are a major reason that customers are attracted to 
EBS
in this space -- through Mathis Conner and others in the Tech Channels Group,
EBS is gaining considerable skill in the value-added services arena (which is
where a lot of the future revenue resides).

Enron Net Works has been helpful to EBS' efforts in the exchange space.  Also
helpful are other EBS groups, such as those of Kevin Garland, Kevin Howard, 
and
Larry Lawyer.  As we become increasingly more visible in this space, we need 
to
think about how we want to unfold the story publicly.

I hope this update is useful.  Best regards.

Brothers,
Woody and I were in the same foursome at our recent golf outing.  Few
people know the manner in which Woody finished out our round.  I don't
think he was aware that I had a camera a caught the moment on film as he
approached the folks waiting for us at the clubhouse.
The photo is attached for your examination.

Howdy,

Its me again.  Sorry about filling up your boxs with this "personal" junk
mail.

My tenant, who was excellent, is moving out at end of September, so will be
spending some of my time in SF looking for someone new.  Any leads?  Most of
you know its details; its expensive but competatively priced.

Mark-O

Why am I not surprised that we'd get smoked only 1 day after you and Ken came 
down?  As an FYI, we saw huge fund liquidation today prompted by a poorly 
traded technical market--however it appears we have now achieved the downside 
targets the funds, etc. watch.  We also heard a rumor (started on the NYMEX 
floor) that the EIA changed their storage stats by 250 Bcf--showing a higher 
inventory.  In fact, the only thing we could find was an obscure update that 
showed a 
change of 25 Bcf only.  
When I asked all of the desk heads about their views of the market, the feel 
is still bullish.  We did see a couple of fertilizer plants stop buying gas 
(one actually sold).  Our traders don't see the tide turning yet with this 
info, however.  
Crude was extremely strong, the weather is hot, and some storage operators 
were also withdrawing.  (you know--mortgage the future sort of trading).  
Needless to say I'll not be knocking on the VAR door today.   Welcome to 
hurricane season 2000. 

On another note, we traded our first weekday only term gas in Texas this 
week, and we anticipate 5x16 gas markets(to serve the texas generators to 
start) trading by month end. 

We'll get 'em....

Enron is one of the best places to work - the employees.

I just had to write to tell you about your wonderful employees! Yes,
Enron Field is the most comfortable, beautiful Baseball Stadium I've
ever been in, but your employees make it great!

I was at yesterdays Inaugural Game (March 30, 2000). Everyone with an
Enron Shirt had a smile on their face and a "Hello" on their lips. My
husband and I had to purchase our tickets through a ticket company, but
the couple next to us got theirs' at COST. How? Well they said they were
in line at Ticketron when she heard everyone talking about the Inaugural
Game at Enron Field. An Enron Employee answered all this lady's (my
seat neighbor at the game) questions and OFFERED her AT COST to sell her
two of her 8 tickets (she said this is what Enron gave to her).
If that wasn't enough, a kind gentleman (wearing an Enron Shirt) was
standing in the concession line (very long lines up in the mezzanine
section), and gently mentioned to me where the line started. After I
went to the back of the line, he offered to help me buy my soda. A very
thoughtful consciences Employee for Enron!
Thank you for the beautiful BallPark, the beautiful hat we were given
and most importantly your wonderful representatives, your Employees!
Sincerely,
Patti Chapman

 1. Nine Classes To Celebrate Reunions At Homecoming October 26-29
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graduates of the classes of 1955, '60, '65, '70, '75, '80, '85, '90, and
'95 will celebrate reunions during this year's Homecoming weekend, October
26-29. Reunion alumni have several opportunities to participate in events
especially for them, including parties on The Boulevard before and after
the SMU-Nevada game and special club-level tours of the Gerald J. Ford
Stadium and Paul B. Loyd Jr. All-Sports Complex.

Activities for all members of the SMU community include performances,
panel discussions, the 2000 Distinguished Alumni Awards celebration,
Homecoming luncheon, open houses in SMU's schools and libraries, campus
tours, the "Pigskin Revue" dinner, the All-School Gathering, and the
lighted Homecoming Parade, featuring grand marshals and Pro Football Hall
of Fame members Raymond Berry ('55) and Lamar Hunt ('56).

and special alumni travel discounts, at

 2. Beta's '75 Planning "Mother of All Homecomings"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 25th reunion of those hilarious Beta boys appears to be not only in full

swing, thanks to the efforts of lead organizer Fred "Beek" Haulenbeek of
Vermont, but an event for the ages.  Just of few of the planned activities
for the weekend include:  A return trip to Mineola in a Ryder truck,
complete with an Officer Caffey-led SMU security escort.  A re-enactment at
somebody's house named Elvis (believed to be Wayne Thompson) of something
called a dork, or dorg, or whatever, complete with a liver and onions dinner

served up by several canines in the neighborhood.  The first presentation of

what Beta's hope to be an annual tradition, the election of the Ellen Parker

Memorial Award, which will be given to the D.O.D. (whatever that is) present

at Graceland who passes out on the commode while the party is in full
progress, then defecates into one of the alum's blankets while being driven
over to the Zeta House.  And last but certainly not least, something called
a GIANT BETA BU-FU, which will involve only the male members of the
gathering, preferably in a bottom bunk in old room #4 of the Beta House.
Also being honored at the homecoming festivities will be this year's
inductees into the Beta Hall of Shame, led by 2000's newest members, Jim
Wicklund, Rick East, Hunter Armistead, and Doug Denham.  Sounds like a blast

to all of us here at the SMU Alumni Center--you don't want to miss it.

3. Meadows Kicks Off Year-Long Celebration Of Spanish Art and Culture
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMU's Meadows School of the Arts is celebrating the March 2001 opening of
the new Meadows Museum with "Bridging Cultures: A Year of Spanish Art and
Tradition at SMU." The series of events, many of them free and open to the
public, will entertain and educate on the culture, traditions, and history
of Spain through lectures, performances, screenings, and
exhibitions. Located on the SMU campus, the Meadows Museum houses one of
the finest collections of Spanish art outside of Spain.

Upcoming events for October include the Meadows Festival of Spanish Film,
featuring screenings of films by Imanol Uribe, Victor Erice, Jose Luis
Guerin, and Carlos Saura, October 11-14 in the Bob Hope Theatre; and "The
Stars at Night...The Mystery of Santiago de Compostela," an art history
lecture by John Williams of the University of Pittsburgh, October 26 at 5
p.m., Room B600, Owen Arts Center.

Events for Meadows Museum members include "Images of the Spanish Civil
War," a lecture by James K. Hopkins, professor of history in SMU's Dedman
College of Humanities and Sciences, October 10, 7:30 p.m., in the old
Meadows Museum, Owen Arts Center. For information on becoming a Museum
member, call 214-768-4153.

Ongoing events include an exhibition on Spanish history in the foyer of
SMU's Bridwell Library. A series of month-long exhibitions will feature
Spanish manuscripts, Spanish Bibles banned by the Inquisition, and
artists' books by Picasso and Dali. Hours are 8:30 a.m.-5
p.m. Monday-Friday through May 2001.

For tickets and more information on monthly events, call 214-768-ARTS.


 4. Susan Faludi To Deliver Louise Raggio Lecture October 11
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Writer Susan Faludi will deliver the Louise Ballerstedt Raggio Endowed
Lecture in Women's Studies on Wednesday, October 11, at 8 p.m. in the
Hughes-Trigg Student Center. Faludi is a Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the
best-selling author of "Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American
Women" and "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Male."

The Raggio Lecture Series brings role models of vision and achievement to
SMU to speak on gender and women's issues. Launched in 1998, the lecture
series honors Louise Raggio -- the only female in the SMU law class of
1952, the first woman assistant district attorney in Dallas, the first
woman director of the State Bar of Texas and chair of the board of the
Texas Bar Foundation, and chair of the Family Law Section of the Texas Bar
and the American Bar.

Tickets are free for SMU students, faculty, and staff, and $10 for the
general public. For more information, call 214-768-2610.


 4. SMU Establishes Company To Develop New Pharmaceutical Products
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMU, in partnership with Research Corporation Technologies, has
established a new company to create pharmaceutical compounds based on the
work of John Buynak, associate professor of chemistry in SMU's Dedman
College of Humanities and Sciences. The company, called AlamX, is the
first such company SMU has established. Buynak has spent more than a
decade developing compounds to help fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
an increasing problem due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics, increases
in resistant strains of bacteria, and lack of comprehensive infection
control in many hospitals.

Christopher Martin of Research Corporation Technologies will serve as
manager of AlamX. Martin says AlamX will select several of Buynak's
compounds, match them with existing antibiotics, and screen these
combinations against a panel of resistant microorganisms. According to the
Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 500 million acute infections in
the United States require antibiotic treatment each year. In 1998, the
market for anti-infective drugs was more than $14 billion. Martin
estimates that a product effective against several classes of compounds
known to promote bacterial resistance to antibiotics could generate annual
sales in excess of $1 billion worldwide.

 5. Legal Clinic Students Win Federal Civil Rights Case
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a case tried by students from the SMU School of Law's Legal Clinic, a
paraplegic has won a federal lawsuit against Dallas County for injuries he
suffered in the county jail infirmary. The complex civil rights case marks
a significant victory for the SMU School of Law's 50-year-old Civil
Clinic. Supervised by Professor Maureen Armour, associate dean for
clinical education and co-director of the Civil Clinic, more than 20
students, working in groups over 10 school terms, represented 41-year-old
Brent Lawson. Armour, who also teaches civil rights legislation, says that
although civil rights cases against local governments are not that
unusual, "it's extremely difficult to win one."

While in the Dallas County Lew Sterrett Justice Center in the fall of
1993, Lawson developed decubitus ulcers, a potentially life-threatening
condition caused by unrelieved pressure on the body. He was admitted to
the jail pending a parole revocation hearing. U.S. District Judge Jerry
Buchmeyer ruled that Lawson, who is confined to a wheelchair, should not
have been admitted to the jail because it lacked proper medical staff and
equipment to attend to his special needs. Judge Buchmeyer ruled August 30
in a 40-page opinion that the jail acted "with deliberate indifference" to
Lawson's constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual
punishment. In addition to finding Dallas County liable for its treatment
of Lawson, Buchmeyer ordered the county to pay $250,000 in damages for his
pain and suffering.

 6. Mustang Athletes Shine In Sydney; Frolander Wins Gold In 100M Fly
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Former Mustang athlete and 1998 NCAA Men's Swimmer of the Year Lars
Frolander ('99) took the gold medal in the men's 100-meter butterfly at
the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. Frolander, competing for his
native Sweden, won with a time of 52.00. The butterfly gold is Frolander's
second Olympic medal. He was a member of the Swedish team that won silver
in the men's 4x100M freestyle relay at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, the same
race in which his Mustang teammate Ryan Berube ('96) helped earn gold for
the United States. Frolander also competed in the 100M free and again on
Sweden's 4x100M free relay team, finishing sixth in both events.

SMU's 1999 NCAA Women's Swimmer of the Year, Martina Moravcova ('98, '99),
took two silver medals -- in the 100M fly and the 200M free -- for her
home nation of Slovakia. Moravcova, who became her country's first Olympic
medalist since 1908, also finished fifth in the 50M and 100M free
events. (SMU head coach Steve Collins, who is also Moravcova's personal
coach, served as honorary head coach for the Slovakian team.) Her Olympic
teammates recognized her achievements by choosing her to carry the
Slovakian flag in the closing ceremonies Sunday night. Another SMU
swimmer, Rania Elwani ('99), competed for Egypt in the semifinals of the
women's 50M and 100M freestyle. Incoming first-year student Anu Koivisto
of Finland competed in the women's 200M and 100M backstroke events.

The Mustang Olympic track and field contingent was led by Sweden's Kasja
Bergqvist ('99); the 1999 NCAA champion won the bronze medal in the
women's high jump. Junior thrower Janus Robberts won a seventh-place
finish for South Africa in the men's shot put. Discus throwers Jason Tunks
('99, Canada) and Alex Tammert ('98, Estonia) placed sixth and ninth in
the men's finals; Ian Winchester ('96, New Zealand) and Robert Weir ('85,
Great Britain) also competed. Teri Tunks ('98), an SMU assistant track
coach, threw for Team USA in the women's shot put. Former Mustang
Christophe Epalle (France) and current SMU junior Libor Charfreitag
(Slovakia) competed in the men's hammer throw. Junior Roman Oravec
competed for the Czech Republic in the men's 800M run.

In team sports, Claudia Brassard-Riebesehl ('99) played for the Canada
women's basketball squad, which advanced to the Classification 9-10
(pre-quarterfinal) game and finished the tournament in 10th place.

 7. School Of Theology Receives $12.1 Million In Scholarship Support
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A collective total of $12.1 million has been pledged for scholarships in
Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology. Donors include
15 area conferences in the United Methodist Church's eight-state South
Central Jurisdiction; Charles and Elizabeth Perkins Prothro of Wichita
Falls, Texas; and other individuals in the jurisdiction. The Prothros'
$4.7 million grant matching conference and individual pledges provided
impetus for the highly successful theology scholarship campaign. Their
son, C. Vincent (Vin) Prothro, and his wife, Caren, pledged $1 million to
the Perkins campaign.

The Texas Conference, which serves the Houston-Galveston area, pledged $1
million, matched by the Moody Memorial First United Methodist Church in
Galveston. The remaining conference donors have pledged to raise between
$100,000 and $1 million each, to be matched by the Prothro family and the
Perkins Foundation.

 8. Gift Funds Geurin-Pettus Chair In Politics and Political Economy
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A gift of $2.5 million from Jo Ann and Sherrill Pettus of Graham, Texas,
will establish a new distinguished faculty chair in American politics and
political economy at SMU. The endowed chair will be the first step toward
developing a new graduate degree program in the Department of Political
Science in Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences.

The new faculty chair will be known as the Geurin-Pettus Distinguished
Chair in American Politics and Political Economy. To fill the chair, the
University will seek a scholar whose research and teaching relate directly
to domestic public policy and governmental and fiscal issues. In addition
to teaching at SMU, the chairholder will spearhead development of a
program to include relevant conferences and forums. The Pettus gift also
will help fund this program.

Without knowing what subcommittees you are going to set up for the exec. 
committee members, I'll take the Analyst/Associate program.  We've been 
incredibly successful with Wharton/Penn , and I'd like to replicate our 
approach company wide.  I'm convinced with my help, we can do a world class 
job.  I'd be happy to give my thoughts on off cycle hiring, and other ways to 
improve the entire process (internal and external) around Enron.  

Thanks.   

Jeff

I will fly in the evening before and try to catch up with Kevin Garland and

Best regards,

David, 

Many thanks for agreeing to speak at our YPO session on April 24, 2001, in 
Houston.? The meeting will be held at Enron Broadband Services' network 
equipment staging building, which is close to downtown.? We anticipate 
attendance of about 100 people. 

Breakfast will begin at 7:30 a.m., and the program will run from 8:15 a.m. 
to 10:15 a.m.? The subject is "New Trends in Technology and Venture 
Capital."? You will be on a panel discussion with two other venture 
capitalists.? I expect the tone will be highly informal, but I will 
schedule a conference call (probably in early March) to provide more 
details and specific topics of interest. 

Again, David, thank you.? I look forward to seeing you in April. 

Jeff

Jeff/Ken:

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday 
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days, 
I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close 
friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some 
politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about 
Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at 
about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading 
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the 
pot. 

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly 
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the 
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also 
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves 
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will 
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control 
and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been 
discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously 
the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the 
outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with 
MOP on Monday. 

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  
of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already 
done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day 
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation 
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - 
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under 
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to 
move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the 
duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current 
$35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase 
I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry 
of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the 
MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to 
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the 
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the 
current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of 
current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been 
scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

Regards,

Sanjay

Greetings, Tom!  Have you recovered from the whirlwind of the inauguration?  
Wasn't that fun!

I'm writing in the hopes you can provide a little background for a cover 
story that Worth Magazine is doing on Jeff - he's traveling and it's 
difficult to reach him, hence my note to you.

The report is interested in the station call letters and channel number in 
Aurora, IL, where Jeff worked in high school.  Additionally, he would like to 
confirm that Jeff started out as a camera man and graduated to producer.  Is 
this the correct history?  Any historical information you can provide is most 
appreciated.

I hope all is well.  Look foward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

Patti,

It was good to see you and Mike last night. 

I wanted to follow up on the MS150 - I can assure you that you will do fine 
without training (assuming, of course, that you have a bike).  I did it that 
way twice before with no major complications.  Given your running, you will 
do better.  It really is a lot of fun.

Sherri is checking to see if you can join the Enron team.  We will be the 
first team off on Saturday morning and the team has good facilities (tents, 
food, etc.) that improve the experience.  GO FOR IT!!

Jeff

PS - hi, Patti - this is Sherri.  I did check with our team captain and she 
said you could join our team so long as you do so by Friday.  She is going to 
e-mail all the necessary forms and information to me, which I will forward to 
you today if you are interested.  Let us know!  Hope all is well...

The Paradox of our time
  By George Carlin

  The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings
but shorter tempers; wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend
more, but have less; we buy more but enjoy less.

  We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but
less time; we have more degrees, but less sense; more knowledge, but
less judgment; more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less
wellness.

  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too
little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too
tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.

  We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk
too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make
a living, but not a life, we've added years to life, not life to years.

  We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing
the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not
inner space.   We've done larger things, but not better things.

  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the
atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan
more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait.

  We build more computers to hold more information to produce more
copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; big men and
small character; steep profits and shallow relationships.

  These are the days of two incomes, but more divorce, fancier houses,
but broken homes.

  These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality,
one-night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from
cheer, to quiet, to kill.

  It is a time when there is much in the show window and nothing in the
stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a
time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit
delete.

  Remember; spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not
going to be around forever.

  Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe,
because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.

  Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is
the only treasure you  can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a
cent.

  Remember, to say "I Love You" to your partner and your loved ones, but
most of all, mean it.
  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of
you.

Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person
will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak, give
time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.

  To my family, and all my friends in my life, thanks for being there!
George Carlin

Hi Mark.  I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe 
it has already come and gone!

Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the 
Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so 
if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - 
I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it 
in the mail to:

Mike, we appreciate you keeping Jeff in the loop for the 2001 U.S. Open.  
However, Jeff is not a golfer and has decided to decline this invitation.  
Thank you for the offer. 
Katherine for Jeff Skilling

Jeff, this message is self explanatory.? Pat Arthur of our office is "in 
charge" of selling and setting up hospitality suites for companies in Texas 
and we have an opportunity for our firm and our firm's friends to sign up 
before he "goes public".? If Enron would be interested, let me know and I 
will make sure it is taken care of.

Regards, 

Mike Buttrey 

PS? thanks again for lunch.

Subject:??????? 2001 U.S. Open 

The U.S. Open golf? tournament will be held at Southern Hills Country Club in 
Tulsa next June 11-17. 

With few exceptions the OPEN is never held this far south, thus making the 
event very accessible to those of us in the Dallas area. This will mark the 
3rd Open to be held at SHCC.

I've been asked to assist in the Corporate Hospitality for the event. Because 
of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the 
world's preeminent sporting events. To see it live , to watch the drama 
unfold in person, is an unforgettable moment. This is one reason why 
companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package. Before I put the 
word out in the Dallas market (and they will sell out soon) I wanted clients 
of MHBT to have the first shot. (I think this is a fair privilage)

The tickets to the event are sold out already, so the only way to gain access 
is via a hospitality package. They aren't cheap but the chance to have a U.S. 
Open so close might never happen again. Prices are from? $28,500 to $150,000. 
These prices range from a table in a furnished, shared pavilion to an 
exclusive environment. 

If you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and I 
will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated 
with each option. 

These started to go on sale in the Tulsa marketplace recently and several 
options are SOLD OUT, including a few over $ 500,000.

Since demand is so high and space is limited I will hold off a week before 
making non-MHBT clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime.

Take advantage of getting your best clients into the 2001 U.S. Open. 

Pat

I have received several calls this morning regarding the above, so apparently 
there is some doubt.  Please be advised that the executive committee will not 
meet today.  Further, due to travel schedules and the holidays, executive 
committee meetings will not be held on Monday, December 18 or Monday, 
December 25.  

Please make note that the next executive committee meeting will be held on 
Tuesday, January 2, 2001at 11:00 a.m. in EB50 Boardroom.

Don't hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.

Regards and Happy Holidays!

Dear Rocky,
Sorry that I missed the get together at SMU last month, but from the
looks of the photos I've seen, a good time was had by all. Hope this
finds you healthy and doing well. My wife and I had dinner last night
with Tom and Betsy McSoley, and your name came up in conversation while
talking about the reunion. I wanted to touch base with you with a
possible business start up idea that may fit into the types of online
services you offer with Enron. We are currently developing an online
licensing agency for the illustration and photographic markets, and I
would like to share the idea and our business plan with you to see if
there is any interest in what promises to be a growing marketplace.
While some companies are currently involved in the photographic end of
this business environment (GettyImages, Corbis), we feel we have a
competitive advantage in that our management team consists of some of
the top illustrators in the field as well as two of the best
intellectual attorneys in the country. We currently have 250 artists and
their collective body of work signed up, and are now in the capital
raising stage, with a launch date of June 2001. I'd love the opportunity
to talk with you further if you think this might be of interest to you.
When time permits, please give me a call at 317 253 3141 and I'd be
happy to share more with you at that time. Thanks for giving this your
consideration Rocky, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Kai

Hello --

The IBM meeting on Monday at 12:30pm in Houston (49C1) is an informal working 
session meeting for the EBS/IBM ASP team rather than a major checkpoint 
meeting.  Therefore, you definitely do not need to attend.  However, you are 
certainly welcome to drop by at any time.  A few morale words about the 
importance of the effort and the size of the joint opportunity with IBM in 
the ASP space are always welcome if you get a chance to come by.

Jeff:  I got a call from Perminder Bindra on Saturday.  He says that the IBM 
team assigned to EBS is extremely excited.  His concern is that there are 
other ASP efforts with other companies going on in IBM, and he fears that the 
"normal" IBM noise level around these efforts could slow us down (our goal is 
an agreement this quarter).  So if you can stress our need for speed in your 
call with Sam P. tomorrow, that would be helpful.  I am hoping that IBM will 
treat EBS as the top ASP-related partnership that they develop.  Thanks for 
your help.  

  Best regards.

-- Rex

FYI....we have added Dan Dienstbier to the Northern Border Partners' Audit 
Committee.

SEC rules dictated that we add another member, and Dan Whitty and Gerald 
Smith wanted someone with an operations background.

Dan also serves on Dynegy's Board, but neither Bill Cordes (President of 
Northern Border) nor I saw a conflict.

With regard to your second invitation to meet your business partner next

 <<MF May 11th, 2001.pdf>>

    Good Friday Morning - Comments From The
Local Guys!

Economic data so far this quarter has been extremely ambiguous. On the one
hand, the employment figures released last Friday were soft, with net hiring
shrinking for the second consecutive month and the unemployment rate rising
to 4.5%. On the other hand, consumer sentiment has improved, and the April
retail sales figures were stronger than anticipated. As we have mentioned,
this mixed data has increased the odds the Federal Reserve will ease by only
25bp next Tuesday. At this stage, Lehman Brothers' economists still think
the odds favor a 50bp cut, given the underlying weakness in the economy,
particularly in high-tech and manufacturing, together with the abysmal
employment data.

The change in the perception on the strength of the economy can be seen in
the higher interest rates posted below.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.87%.
The 10-year yield is 5.47%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.98%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.62 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $4.27 p/mcf.

   AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS

Entertainment S. Linde, .212.526.4009
Upfront Preview: CBS and FOX Appear Well Positioned
*With the WGA negotiations all but settled, the Entertainment industry will
now turn its sights to the upfront selling cycle, which
commences May 14 with presentations from the major Networks lasting through
May 17.
*The current ad market has created fears of a weak upfront market. Ad buyers
must be careful not to look at the current economic
environment as a proxy for the future. Based on this premise, there may be
upside to our 5%-10% estimated decline in upfront sales
(based on 65%-70% inventory sales with low to mid single digit price
increases).
*In our opinion, VIAB and FOX are the best positioned for this year's
upfront given that improved ratings in the key 18-49
demographic combined with our expectation for modest CPM increases will
boost unit pricing.

Reebok Intl Ltd(RBK) 2 - Buy R. Drbul, .212.526.4714
Preview of Investor Day on May 21 (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E

FY: 12/31 Price Target $36 $36
Rank 2 2
*On May 21, Reebok will be hosting an investor day in Canton, Massachusetts.
We believe that this event should be highly
informative as investors will have the opportunity to view the crucial back
to school product line as well as hear several key
executive presentations.
*We expect to hear presentations from David Perdue, a Reebok veteran and
recently appointed president of the Reebok brand, Jay
Margolis, president of the specialty division (Rockport, Ralph Lauren
footwear and Greg Norman brands) and Terry Pillow,
President of the Rockport brand, among others.
*We will also be looking for additional information on the company's new NFL
licensing deal, which could generate $200 million and
be accretive by $0.05 in 2002 (included in our 2002 estimate).
*We believe that an inflection point in the stock could be the 3Q01, where
we are estimating $60 million of NFL revenues. This
incremental revenue should aid in 12% overall revenue growth for RBK.

*Our meeting with senior management yesterday confirmed that demand for
STOR's services remains strong; we believe that the stock
is still undervalued at current levels despite its recent rise.
*STOR's management stated that the pipeline of activity for new customers
continues to be robust and that its current customer base is
also growing.
*We believe that STOR is benefiting from the increasing complexity of
managing enterprise data storage environments.
*We believe STOR is funded to profitability.
*The company's maturing sales force should lead to continued productivity
gains. In addition, STOR is shifting its revenue mix to
higher margin services.
*We believe that the stock overhang stemming from the lock-up expiration is
largely behind us.
*Despite its recent run, the stock is still trading at a discount to its
peer group.

McDonald's Corp(MCD) 1 - Strong Buy M. Speiser, .212.526.3255
Reducing '01 EPS not on Ops/adj share base & int expense
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $27.2 EPS 2000 N/A $1.46 N/A N/A

FY: 12/31 Price Target $38 $38
Rank 1 1
*Our lower EPS view is not based on weakening Operations, but is due to
adjustments to our share base & interest expense estimates.
So we do not expect much impact on the stock. Lowering already-weak EPS
expectations will likely prove to be beneficial for the
stock. Maintain Op outlook
*Reducing our '01 EPS view from $1.50 to $1.46, now flat vs. a yr-ago & the
low on the Street
*Our revision reflects adjustments to our share base & interest expense
estimates. With $1.2b in buyback targeted in '01 & $452m
done in 1Q, our previous forecast reflected more aggressive repo; mgmt is
adamant that '01 buyback would not pass $1.2b. Also,
higher debt levels will not likely be offset by weak currencies as much as
we thought
*Imp'rtantly our Op outlook albeit weak is unchanged
*Maintain 1-rating. We're now confident that our '01 EPS view will not be
lowered anymore. With the shares at a 4+ year valuation
low & the bar on expectations very low, the risk/reward is favorable

IBM Corp(IBM) 1 - Strong Buy G. Elling, .212.526.3823
Innovate and Integrate: Gerstner Gives Vision for Future
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $116.98 EPS 2000 N/A $4.44 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $135 - 80 EPS 2001 $4.90E $4.90E $4.85E 23.9

FY: 12/31 Price Target $160 $160
Rank 1 1
*Yesterday IBM hosted its annual meeting for security analysts in New York.
While there were no major surprises, CEO Lou Gerstner
did outline some trends for the future, and stressed the importance of
innovation and integration (i.e., Technology and Services) for
the company going forward.
*Gerstner emphasized the importance of services as a driving force in all IT
spending, including hardware and software. Gerstner also
cited the need for continued technological development as a way to avoid
price wars driven by commoditization of products.
*Gerstner stressed IBM's commitment to high single-digit revenue growth and
double-digit earnings growth in the future. Gerstner
indicated that the company would not simply grow revenue at any cost, but
was instead focused on EPS and cash flow driven by an
operational execution.
*We maintain our current estimates and reiterate our 1-Strong Buy rating on
IBM shares.
IT Consulting & Computer Services K. Keirstead, .212.526.0442
Gerstner's View of IT Services
*Yesterdays comments from the CEO Lou Gerstner and the head of IBM Global
Services Doug Elix represent positive long-term
statements about the IT services industry. IBM is positioning itself as a
services-lead company and claimed that the services business
is now the most important segment of the technology sector. The meeting
supports our positive view of EDS while the comments
about the consulting and systems integration market make us incrementally
more worried about Sapient and Computer Sciences.

Electronic Arts(ERTS) 3 - Market Perform F. Kantor, .212.526.5562
Upside to Q; Outlook Bullish; Wish Stock Were Cheaper (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $54.52 EPS 2000 N/A $0.00 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $62 - 25 EPS 2001 $0.84E $0.89E $0.68E 61.3
Mkt Cap: $7.6B EPS 2002 N/A $1.71E $1.74E 31.9
FY: 3/31 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*There is no doubt in our minds that ERTS is one of the premier publishers
in the industry. The co's solid performance in a difficult Q
makes it easy to believe that when hurdles are absent (i.e. an abundance of
game consoles) they can outperform. That said, we wish
the stock were not so pricey. Due to valuation, we reiterate our market
perform.
*1Q01 operating EPS of $(0.09) vs $0.08 were better than our $(0.15) est.
Most of the upside came from EA Core, where in line revs
were bolstered by lower op. exp. At EA.com, slightly higher revs were offset
by lower margins.
*We are raising our consol. FY02E to $0.89 from $0.84 and are initiating
quarterly EPS of $(0.13), $(0.05), $0.87 and $0.20. We are
also initiating a consol. FY03E EPS of $1.71.
*Adjusting for EA.com, ERTS currently trades at a forward P/E of 35.3x -
higher than hist averages. Though ERTS is on the cusp of
solid growth, this valuation indicates that it is currently in the stock.

IDEC Pharmaceuticals(IDPH) 2 - Buy M. Wood, .212.526.4035
IDEC: Response on Zevalin to the FDA by mid-July. (A,C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $54.19 EPS 2000 N/A $0.30 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $78 - 19 EPS 2001 $0.52E $0.52E $0.55E 104.2
Mkt Cap: $6.9B EPS 2002 $0.67E $0.67E $0.84E 80.9
FY: 12/31 Price Target $49 $49
Rank 2 2
*IDEC expects to answer the FDA's questions on Zevalin by mid-July. Our
assumption for launch in 1Q02 remains intact.
*The FDA has issued a Complete Review Letter on Zevalin, asking IDEC to
address a number of clinical and CMC issues.
*The FDA is not requiring additional Phase III trials or further imaging on
patients for the BLA submission.
*The timing for Zevalin at the FDA remains a question. There are currently
no completion requirements for the FDA, although we are
clearly encouraged by IDEC's ability to respond quickly.
*We continue to expect launch in 1Q02. We maintain our sales projections for
Zevalin in 2002 and 2003 at $70.9 million and $119.8
million, respectively.

I figured you two might get a kick out of this - this was taken last Sunday 
while I was at the New York 5 Boro Bike Ride.  I went up there to ride with 
some of my NERC friends, and Mike was very impressed with our jerseys.  I 
figured the humor of the situation just had to be well documented.

       Dear Mark; Thank you for your nice message.   The reference to Macomb
was my trip down to the Western U game on Nov 25.  I thought I told you about
the Lehigh runaway 37-7.  Uncle Dave went to Knox College in Galesburg and I
went thru the Knox campus and commented to Dave.  The game so inspired me I
went to the Delaware game on Dec 2 and came back to Earth as Lehigh lost
47-24.  The score was higher than the quality of the game Indicated but the
best team won.                          Delaware lost yesterday to Georgia
Southern  who will play Montana U next Saturday for the NCAA Class-11
Championship.
      I will be looking forward to the second newsletter.  Mother and I
cleared out last Friday as two young ladies came in to clean our Condo for
the first time.  They did a super job and we are going to have them come
every two weeks. We will not have to do any heavy work from now on.  I have
joined the Kiwanis Golden "K" which meets weekly and is a group of 'OVER 55"
retirees.  Should be fun as I already know many of them.
     I got a list of the    Senior Courses for the Spring semester.  I will
register early to make sure I get the computer course and learn how to use
this thing fully.
     I will on line again soon   Mother and I send LOTS OF LOVE AND KISSES.

Jeff,

I am a YPOer in the Rebel Chapter who was given your name from an IOS source
as someone who could potentially help in this situation. As background, I
sent this IOS request out last week:

Description of Situation
My highway construction company has been negatively impacted by price
volatility in energy prices (fuel, natural gas, and asphalt cement). We
offer long term, fixed price contracts to our clients yet must purchase our
petroleum and energy-related products at spot market prices. Thus we are
exposed to significant price adjustment risks.

Type of Feedback Requested:
Does anyone have experience using commodity contracts as an arbitrage
strategy to offset the risks of potential price volatility in the energy
sector? If so, do you have specific recommendations for how we should
proceed?

Thank you for any information you can offer.

As I have investigated this further, I find no one in this industry (highway
construction) who is purchasing futures to mitigate their energy cost
exposure. I have spoken with folks who are doing this in the building supply
sector with lumber futures.

Do you have any thoughts or suggestions in this matter? Any input would be
greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,

Michael Mangum

Jeff,
Having read the most recent issue of Information  week, I was compelled to 
contact you. Developed out of Stanford University our  technology is 
specifically designed to create efficiencies and competitive  advantage for 
companies such as Enron.
As you are building your vision for 2001,  I?think that it would 
be?imperative to assess our products  capabilities,?I would like to set a 
time to introduce and  demonstrate?our value to your evolving strategy. We 
are currently  discussing and demonstrating the value of our technology to 
executive teams at:  KnightRidder, eBay, Manpower,?Siebel and Monster.com and 
would like  the?opportunity to impress you! 
?
Sincerely,
?

Betas:
Fall is coming brothers...it was 40 degrees when I left for work the
other morning.  It was the first day since early June that I had to wear
long pants to work.  We had a high of 60 degrees.  I guess I better get
used to it.  This winter I will be working outdoors every day...a good
number of below zero days can be counted on.  However, I predict terrific
weather in Dallas the entire homecoming weekend.

Bino is finally a solid yes and Harry Singleton told me that he was
planning to be there too.  Still no word from those mid west boys, except
Dave Lesh and Tom Hutchison.

Woody has volunteered to be in charge of getting our tickets for the
SMU-Nevada homecoming game.  Fire off an e-mail and let him know how many
tickets you will be needing:  boethia@hotmail.com

If you are interested in playing some golf with John Grumbles at his
club, get in touch with him for that:  John_Grumbles@berryplastics.com
("underscore" between "John" and "Grumbles")

More information regarding weekend events and activities will follow in
future messages.

Thanks for all the wonderful messages.  It's great to hear from Y'ALL!

Don't forget to check out the attached pictures.

Metin,

Great to hear from you.  Believe it or not, my brother lives in Istanbul and 
my son Jeffrey and I are going to visit him this summer - somewhere in the 
June 23 to June 28 timeframe.  I'd love to see you if it's possible.  I'll 
let you know when my plans are firm.

Jeff

an easy call.

Subject: ENA 2000 Offsite

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Regards
Dave and John

Hi everyone.  Things seem fine here.  Took long walks, one late last night
and one this morning, and saw little eveidence of damage.
Saw on CNN that americans say quake 7.8  Unbelievable.

My lap top running out of battery, so will just refer you to the below,
which was my reponse to my a note from my brother several hours ago.

        * * *

Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; many stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half
a block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a generator and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying,
men reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs shut a door;
mistook that commotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much
like after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

Whoever was asking, "Who the hell is Ricky Bier?", might check out this
picture from Tom Benson.  He's right next to Steve LaRash.

These names are probably all GREEK to Geoff Anderson and his mates...but
go ahead and open it anyway Geoff, there's still a couple of guys that
you will recognize.

Space:  we need some more o-fo pics!  Never mind...I found one...class of
'72 and '73, check out picture #2

Dear Fellow YPO'er:

YPO is such a dynamic organization because of the quality and enthusiasm of
its members.
As Membership Chairman, I feel a profound responsibility to add new members
to further
that result.  To accomplish that, the Membership Committee needs the
attention and input
of all current members.

First, be on the lookout for any new potential members.  If you identify a
potentail candidate,
please contact my office (713-966-2602 or jeff_hines@hines.com).  Second,
and vitally
important, is to receive your comments, positive or negative, on candidates
who are
proceeding through the membership process.  Attached is the bio for
potential member
Carin Marcy Barth.

The Membership Committee seeks input on these candidates for a two-week
period
following the dissemination of their bios.  Again, please refer any input
to my office.
A several word comment as a reply to this e-mail is fine.  This timely
information is
critical to the process.  Remember, we need positive feedback (as well as
negative).
Many times prospective candidates have told us they know a lot of people in
YPO,
so when we do not hear positively about them it is concerning.  All input
shared with
the Membership Committee is held in Forum confidentiality.  If you have
input that you
feel that you only want to share with me please let me know.  Input
received after this
two-week period does not help the process.  Speak now or forever....you
know the rest!

Thanks for your input.

Sincerely,

Jeff Hines
Membership Chairman

By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you 
with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very 
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.  
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert, 
the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June 
30th.  

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry 
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) 
at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a 
success.

Dear Jeffrey,

I am contacting you at the suggestion of my brother Jeff Spar, Chief
Information Officer of Reader's Digest and formerly of McKinsey [NYO 1990-
1999].

I am the CEO of a Houston based Microsoft technology consultancy
called ESX Engineering. ESX has strong capabilities in software
development, IT infrastructure and creative services. We have exceptional
capability in Mobile/Wireless and Web based workflow application
development. We also have tremendous domain experience in healthcare
solutions.

As a small company CEO I am always looking for new opportunities to meet
individuals whose firms may have need of our services. I would appreciate
the opportunity to meet and introduce myself and ESX. If appropriate we
could explore any potential opportunities between your firm and ESX, or
perhaps you could provide a further referral.

Sincerely Yours,

Steve Spar


PS - ESX was recently featured in the Growth Strategies section of the
Houston Business Journal.  You can view the article on the HBJ site
(http://houston.bcentral.com/houston/stories/2001/04/30/smallb1.html).

Jeff,

I am forwarding an analysis put together by Sandeep Kohli and reviewed by 
Vince and me.  The results in the attached word document show that Dabhol 
energy costs are several cents below that of roughly 600 MW of distributed 
generation which has been identified in Maharastra.  This 600 MW does not 
include innumerable small generators which will have even worse energy 
costs.  The excel spreadsheet contains the data and calculations.

Regards,

Stinson

Vince/Stinson,

Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as 
well as the revised statement that can be made to press.

The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of 
the genset issue.  They do not take into account the capital costs of the 
gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating 
in homes, and commercial establishments.

Hope ths helps.

Regards,
Sandeep.

I am writing to second all the requests you've probably hearing for money
contributions for Turkey's recovery efforts.  Turkey has a population of
some 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The per
capita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hit
so hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the last
few decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,
for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago to
what some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!
Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who moved
from the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.
The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of the
corner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.

I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which to
distribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try the
American Red Cross,  P.O. Box 37243, Washington DC 20013; 1 (800) helpnow;
www.redcross.org.

Thanks,

Mark-O

Hi Sherri.

Thanks for your response on behalf of Jeff.  If Jeff can't make it, we will

Talking points for Jean-Marie Messier, Chairman and CEO of Vivendi. 

Blockbuster has had several meetings with Universal to obtain rights to 
content for the video on demand (VOD) offering.  Blockbuster has proposed an 
agreement to license product for both VHS/DVD rentals and the video on demand 
offering.

The negotiations have stalled because Universal has not been willing to sign 
any long-term agreements without Vivendi's support.

Blockbuster has refused to renew their agreement with Universal for VHS/DVD 
rentals until Universal agrees to grant digital VOD rights.  This will be 
detrimental to both parties.

We would like for Vivendi to communicate to Universal that they would support 
a VOD agreement between Universal and Blockbuster for digital content 
rights.  A conversation with Mr. Messier on this topic would be appreciated.


Contact Information:

Jean-Marie Messier
Phone:  011-331-717-11717
Fax:        011-331-717-11432


Please let me know if you have any questions, or need any additional 
information.   Also, any feedback you receive from Mr. Messier would be very 
helpful.  I can be reached at extension 35741 or on my cellular phone 
713-410-7279.  Thanks for your attention to this matter.

Regards,
Ellen Fowler

Subject: tent


Elvis,
Woody sent me a note today.  In it he mentioned that he has the old roll
book from the fraternity house.  He said he took it because the young
fellas had no respect for the past.
This reminded me of an idea I had earlier.  I was thinking of the banner
for our tent and thinking of some way of making it clear that it was the
Old Betas tent...and beer.  I was thinking of 'Original House Betas',
'Silver/Grey Betas'(...though I've become a silver-gray, my heart keeps
time and measure... with Beta Theta Pi, to find my highest pleasure.

tent from the active Beta tent.
I'm sure there are any number of clever titles that accomplish the same
thing....keeping a bunch of young beer guzzling freeloading strangers out
of our fricking tent!

Thanks for the time yesterday.  I wanted also to tell you about this 
recurring dream I've had (3 times now).  Your buddy Lee Raymond's company 
bought Enron, you both become co-CEO (money on you), and our mgmt team gets 
to apply our way of business to ExxonMobil, and unbelievable wealth and 
shareholder value is created.  Odds?

Jeff

Amelia, I was able to collect the remainder of the pledges ($5,140).  Please 
let me know where you are located, and I'll try to get it over there today.  
If you happen to be in the building and want to stop by, that's fine, too.  
Katherine knows where it is if I'm not at my desk.  SRS

Dear Jeff,

Today is my last official day at Enron. It has truly been a great 
professional experience working at Enron.  
Particularly memorable has been the opportunity to work with some of the most 
talented people ever gathered in one organization.

Should a need arise in the future where my skills and experience can make a 
difference, please do not hesitate to contact me.

With Best Regards,

Jeff,

I have reviewed the information you sent regarding Simon Lee.   I was, in 
fact, aware of the memo sent by Sharon Butcher as I had requested that she 
detail the rationale for the decision.   While Sharon's decision is sound and 
logic based, it is ultimately a business decision.  I agree that if it is not 
illegal to provide remuneration to Simon that we should do so because it is 
not worth Enron's reputation in the market place to quibble over this issue.  
Moreover, based upon other issues that I have encountered as a result of 
promises made by the previous administration, I have no doubt that Simon was 
acting under the direction of individuals running the program.

The concern I would like for you to consider prior to making a decision about 
Simon Lee is whether Enron is prepared to offer the same remuneration to 
others who indicate that they are similarly situated.   I am not sure how 
many others may step forward but I have attached a copy of an e-mail from at 
least one individual who has a similar circumstance.  Ironically, this 
individual who was Simon Lee's roommate at Harvard chose to exercise his 
vested options.   He is now an Enron employee and is awaiting the outcome of 
Simon's situation.

In my opinion, these and other individuals like them should be treated 
consistently.  I do not advocate that we search for them but I would like to 
know that if the issue arises that it will not be necessary to expend time 
and energy on each individual case.  

Additionally, equally if not more important, is the issue of how this 
situation arose and what can be done to alleviate it in the future.   I would 
like to discuss at your convenience.

Thanks Charlene

Howdy again,

You might be interested in knowing that a version of the previous was
published in the English language Turkish Daily News here on February 9th.
(I'm still waiting to hear back from some folks in the States.)  Afraid that
it might appear a bit negative about the Turks, I shortened it, taking out
for example my speculation about how Turkish soldiers might treat folks who
outflanked the fence as well as some of my thoughts about why all the
windows had been knocked out.  (I did leave in my thought about
"vindictiveness" being the justification.)   It still got edited a bit, for
example my use of the word "invasion" was changed to "Peace Operation",
which is the somewhat euphemistic term it is known by here (which doesn't
not mean I am saying the Turks weren't justified in invading the place).

I'd love to hear your thoughts about it, or any other news that you all
might have.

Hope all goes well.

Mark

Howdy.  The below was originally the (false) start of a short story, but
quickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some of
the original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflect
anything about yours truly.  Later.

At The Galata Tower Cafe

Cigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs in
the air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughts
about teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.
"Take it easy", it says with a smirk.  "Relax."  A phony look of concern
clouds it further.  "What about taking a deep breath?"  Surreptitiously
(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has drifted
in closer, notices.  "There!  Isn't that better?"

"No", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to take
this internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through one
particularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  "Now get lost!"

Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way home
from school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which is
amplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone walls
surrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the huge
tower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare out
the window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards of
the tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  The
tower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entire
neighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of the
durability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressive
characteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, by
the slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), it
stands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.

Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,
one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)
drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half as
bothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubt
been subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so year
history.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square to
re-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm the
only one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have to
serve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't bother
them, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's play
has a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basic
training.

I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next to
me. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, for
my benefit, his version of the question "More tea?"  (He has given up on
words, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)

"Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With a
little milk, please.]"  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, I
agree  [and have been told before] too many "lutfens".  There are
probably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.
I'll work on perfecting them, "sonra [later]".)

 Yusuf nods, walks away.

I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I must
have made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of the
tables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is the
beginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitched
wail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poor
thing, I look away.

For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take a
close look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. "Dikkat! [Watch
out!]")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which is
surprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,
their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however
-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.

Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which are
seriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle of
each table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.

Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a corner
of the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scene
from somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, it
has aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappeared
amongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  The
green of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it is
approaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color of
the mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the tea
served here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto the
sand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as if
someone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed and
distorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedly
stirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from having
walked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long ago
surrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearing
clothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn just
one more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreaming
perhaps of little more than an early spring.

I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,
surprisingly, begin to relax.

Whoever was asking, "Who the hell is Ricky Bier?", might check out this
picture from Tom Benson.  He's right next to Steve LaRash.

These names are probably all GREEK to Geoff Anderson and his mates...but
go ahead and open it anyway Geoff, there's still a couple of guys that
you will recognize.

Space:  we need some more o-fo pics!  Never mind...I found one...class of
'72 and '73, check out picture #2

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

Legal Issue & List - nothing yet. I have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow 
with Don Hollingsworth's point man (Dennis Thompson) and will acquire these 
two items ASAP. 

Exec Recruiter -
Ted Bland has found three Executive Recruiting firms willing to assist us in 
our search:
 Kenneth Kern & Associates - Ken Kern
 Korn Ferry International - Bruce Peterson & Bob Loftland
 David Preng & Associates - David Preng
I forwarded to him a copy of the City's Advertisement with all specifics, 
including qualifications and salary offered, and a list of 35 potential 
candidates which I have compiled based on my research. I have also made him 
aware that the city absolutely will NOT offer a contract.

Hello Jeff, the purpose for this message is to bring attention to
my firm, SDL International.   Big admirer of what Enron and you
 have done in the broadband sector and would like to prove the
value of my firm to Enron.   SDL is by far, one of the largest, market
leaders in the Globalization industry for Fortune 500 companies
who must have a global presence via the web to their targeted
customers.   SDL is based in the UK, (US HQ in Plano, TX), with
offices in over 26 countries and employing over 730.   We are
publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange, been in business
for  10 years and the only vendor in this space that is profitable.

I'd like to speak with you or a direct report about the potential of
working with Enron for your globalization needs.    Certainly
you  understand the extreme difficulties and expense you may face in
maintaining consistent content and branding across your multiple,
multi-lingual websites.  SDL is a leading globalization infrastructure and
services firm that can streamline those issues while positively impacting
the bottom line.  Our services span from Internationalization (both web
and software), technology (Webflow and ETS), professional services and
worldwide translation services, all developed and orchestrated to work
as a single, seamless effort.    Surely Enron handles alot of this already
but could the current process be made more cost effective as well
as expediting or increasing international revenue from foreign
markets?

SDL also offers ETS, a real time translation product that allows for
instant, multi lingual messaging, email, web based customer support,
etc... Product currently has a significant installed base of clients, in
particular, a joint effort between EDS and the FAA for global emails to
pilots and airports, as well as being used at Lucent as an internal
communications tool.    Again, this type of technology would be use
solely for content/info. one would not normally localize or translate.
ETS Webflow, which will further seperate us from the other static in the
Globalization industry.

I look forward to any suggestions you may have on how and with whom to
proceed further with. Thanks again for your time and have a great day.

Regards,

Michael

It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=
ve=20
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=
n.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=
=20
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=
=20
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=
=20
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20
McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20
Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20
Works.  It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did =
as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=
=20
Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=
=20
be a part of Enron Net Works.  The success of EnronOnLine enables us to=20
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the=
=20
following individuals are included in Enron Net Works along with their=20
current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Ja=
y=20
Fitzgerald, New Markets Identification; Bruce Garner, Metals; and Greg Pipe=
r,=20
Pulp and Paper.

Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational=20
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business=20
opportunity.

Jeff (Rocky) Skilling is not able to attend the football game, but he 
appreciates you offering to get him a ticket.  He will, however, be at Elvis'

Subject: Last call for tickets


Various Beta Buttheads,
   OK, the deadline is fast approaching.  We're inside two minutes to play
and I need to know the game plan.  As of this day Oct. 2, here's what I have
confirmed in tickets ordered so that we all may sit together at this year's
homecoming game:
Mannino/1, Beek/1, Jordan/1, Artie/1, Wallace/1, Elvis/2, Grumbles/2,
Glass/3, Chuckles/1, J. Miller/2, Shack/1, Space/8 (he's bringing all of
Elzie's living relatives), Hutch/2, Fullerton/2, Coburn/2, Jansson/5 (he's
bringing all of Mom Pinchbeck's living relatives), Rossell/2, and Carl
Hohl/2 (he thinks...not sure because he never was).
    Now, if there are ANY OTHERS, you have about 48 hours because I need to
order these things when I get back in town on the 5th.  So if any of you
reading this want some, give me an email.  Also think about recruiting
others not on my email list that you think might not yet know about all
these plans.
     WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO ROCK THE NEW STADIUM.  I've already
contacted officer Caffey and he's given us yet another reprieve to behave
any damned way we want to, complete with SMU Secuity protection.


Yours in -kai-
Dro

That's right; the dot is coming.  Prepare to be enlightened, entertained and 
engaged.  Prepare to receive information online that is so current, your 
mouse will be hiding under its mousepad.  Prepare to enter a brave new world 
of communication at Enron.  A world in which news is delivered so quickly you 
just might not be able to keep up.

A world in which we can rest easy that the information we need will be 
delivered with the speed and efficiency the Most Innovative Company in 
America deserves.

The dot is coming.  And it's bringing news you can use.  Now.

How kind of you and Enron to think about employees like myself who have lost 
a beloved family member and who are having a hard time during this holiday 
season.  Dr. Williams' session below was very helpful, and I ran into 3 
fellow employees that I work  with that I didn't even know were going through 
a similar situation.  Thank you very much.

Happy Holidays to you and yours.

Gentlemen:
I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact  all of you at Enron  in
regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as  I have made
the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of
Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding
that Enron is undergoing a huge  internal transformation to become one of
the leading E-Commerce players worldwide.

Network Associates is the leading and independent provider   of total
security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications,
E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the
mission to start  the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to
increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of
supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US
with complete P&L responsibilities.

Previous to join NAI, I worked  for Seagate where I had the
responsibilitity to set up the whole  supply chain in South Florida and
and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US
in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering
technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments.


Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity
within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at
954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best
regards, Herbert Arturo Molina

Dear Jeff,

Several weeks ago I sent you the draft of a chapter on you in my
forthcoming book
on great problem solvers.  By sending you a courtesy copy in advance of
publication, I wanted to give you a chance to help correct or update the
text and give me any comments to make sure I'm treating the subject fairly
in your mind.  My deadline is approaching, but I still haven't heard from
you or anyone in your organization.  Could you please let me know if you
plan to comment, or if there is anything I can do to make the process more
convenient.  I'm happy to speak to someone on the phone, for instance.

Thanks again for your participation and assistance,

Sincerely,

Christopher Hoenig

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley 
about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily 
for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, 
while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it 
is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I 
will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term 
Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital 
community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future 
payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some 
very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to 
cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think 
that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if 
I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer 
enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned 
professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this 
note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too 
presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not 
wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep 
up the great work!

Jay

Various Beta Buttheads,
   OK, the deadline is fast approaching.  We're inside two minutes to
play
and I need to know the game plan.  As of this day Oct. 2, here's what I
have
confirmed in tickets ordered so that we all may sit together at this
year's
homecoming game:
Mannino/1, Beek/1, Jordan/1, Artie/1, Wallace/1, Elvis/2, Grumbles/2,
Glass/3, Chuckles/1, J. Miller/2, Shack/1, Space/8 (he's bringing all of
Elzie's living relatives), Hutch/2, Fullerton/2, Coburn/2, Jansson/5
(he's
bringing all of Mom Pinchbeck's living relatives), Rossell/2, and Carl
Hohl/2 (he thinks...not sure because he never was).
    Now, if there are ANY OTHERS, you have about 48 hours because I need
to
order these things when I get back in town on the 5th.  So if any of you
reading this want some, give me an email.  Also think about recruiting
others not on my email list that you think might not yet know about all
these plans.
     WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO ROCK THE NEW STADIUM.  I've already
contacted officer Caffey and he's given us yet another reprieve to behave

any damned way we want to, complete with SMU Secuity protection.


Yours in -kai-

Dear Jeff:

I would like to invite you to honor us as the keynote speaker for the Tenth 
Annual Better Business Bureau Awards for Excellence.  This prestigious awards 
program is currently sponsored by the Better Business Bureau Education 
Foundation, the Houston Chronicle, and the University of Houston Bauer 
College of Business.  Proceeds from the event will provide scholarships for 
outstanding students involved in the BBB Education Foundation's Junior Sleuth 
program.  In addition, support generated from the program will assist the 
advancement of Silver Sleuths, a senior protection program initiated by the 
Better Business Bureau to help senior citizens recognize and prevent consumer 
fraud in the Houston market place.  Participants will be presented awards in 
front of some of Houston's most prominent companies and winners will be 
profiled in a special section of the Houston Chronicle.  Incidentally, Jack 
Sweeney, Publisher of the Houston Chronicle, will serve as honorary chair for 
the event.

The date and location for this year's event has not been set, however, the 
program will take place in early October and will be held during lunchtime.  
Featured keynote speakers have included Frank Carney of Papa John's, Greg 
Brenneman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Continental Airlines, 
Frank Maguire, former executive of The ABC Network, Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
Federal Express, and American Airlines, M. Douglas Ivester, CEO of the 
Coca-Cola Company, Stanley Marcus of Neiman-Marcus & Co., and Richard 
Teerlink, President and CEO of Harley Davidson, Inc.  Enron has definitely 
proven itself to be an asset to the Houston community as a leader and I feel 
your involvement in our event will only make it more apparent.  I sincerely 
thank you for your consideration on this matter and I look forward to hearing 
from you.  You can reach me at 713-977-4777, ext. 126.

Light volume, positive day... yawn, yawn... then after the close: the
biggest non-news news of the millennium - Judge Jackson ruled to break-up
Mr. Softee.  MSFT sold off initially (after being up small on the day) but
is trading up over 2 as I write this (5:45PM NY Time).  Gates is defiant and
feels that things will go his way on appeal - he might be right but given
Mr. Bill's penchant for seeming arrogant it was abit odd to see him as the
front man dismissing questions about the naming of the second company as if
it were completely out of the realm of possibility.  A more tempered, less
emotional, less personal response might have been abit more comforting for
stockholders - many people feel Mr. Bill's hubris got them into this mess to
begin with - look at INTC and CSCO - they know when to tip their hat at
Uncle Sam and stay out of the court room.  The key is the restrictions which
are supposed to go into effect in 90 days - Gates feels very very very very
confident that they will be thrown out and Mr. Softee will suffer no harm
during the appeal - evidentially many after hours traders share his view.
They seem unconcerned of the threat to the new MSFT net strategy - which is
to be announced at the end of June.  In the broader markets - it was a
reversal of yesterday with financials and tech on the rebound (IBM, ORCL,
HWP, SUNW, C, BAC, AXP, LEH, BSC, AMTD...) and utilities and energy falling
to profit taking (XOM, BPA, RD, WMB, PCG, CPL....).  In the CEUT Universe -
it was a mixed bag - ITWO* up over 11, MANU* (which was down over 5) closed
in the green - Catherine Moore spoke inter-day and said the sellers were
wrong..... AMCC* down almost 10, KOPN* down almost 3 1/2, PMCS* down over 2
but SSTI* up over 7.... BRCD* up over 10 1/2, NTAP* & PRCM up over 4...
MUSE* up over 4, VRTS* up over 9.... TMPW up over 3... GMH* down over 8 1/2,
XMSR* up 1/2, PGTV* down over 6 1/2... IMAN+ up almost 1...   In IPO-land
GCBF never came but UbiquiTel (UPCS), a wireless service provider associated
with Sprint PCS,  came at 8 (below original range) and closed down almost 4%
- not great but given these markets.... tomorrow is the PPI # - if shows
soft on inflation then the feeling is the Fed will not raise in June.

MSFT's Ballmer - in Europe - echoes Gates defiant stand at press conf. in
Europe.

T - backing off on long dist. hikes/ also testing multiple ISPs on cable
system in Colo.

SNE - delaying US dig. TV debut/ also portable version of Playstation to
compete with Gameboy.

Ebay* - FBI says we're not targets of probe

SUNW - major transition from hardware vendor to hard/software ASP.

C.E. Unterberg Towbin's Brian Finnerty on CBS with Brian Gumble - ORCL, SUNW
will be helped by MSFT trouble also EFII+ looks very attractive.

UrbanFetch - in London beating Kozmo to Europe.

Sameday.com now in San Fran. - we're not like Kozmo - we're like Fed Ex.

European Union - value added tax on net services.

Marc Andreessen - avid user of RIMM* pager - answers 150 messages a day on
the road.

Kampground of America - largest chain of open air campgrounds is getting
wired - outdoor net kiosks.

AlohaBob - software let you transfer your computer settings from one box to
another.

Salon.com - cutting costs by 20%.

13 computer game co. (including Nintendo, SNE) suing sites for selling
pirated software.

Viacom's Simon and Schuster - publishing 35,000 word book exclusively online
- follows CBS News segement - The Class of 2000: A Definative Survey of the
New Generation.

AOL - will cover Dem and Rep conventions live online.

NYSE - quoting 50 stocks in decimals after Labor Day (Sept) - will go from
there.

Oxygen Media - Ophra Winfrey's networkd for women - major backing, major
players - suspends two hallmark shows suddenly - signs of trouble?

Beliefnet.com - religion, sprituality and morality site - gets $20 million.

NY Post - headline "Broken Windows".

Jack Welch - Goverment should never break up companies.

DIS former Chairman Joe Roth - new movie and net co. "Revolution Studios" -
$3 Billion SNE and Fox major backers.

JP Morgan's LabMorgan - electronic finance unit - investing up to $1Billion
in e-finance ventures - esp. in Asia.

QCOM - signs lic deals with 8 top Chinese manf. - to develop CDMA phones and
infrast.

INTC and TXI - selling MU shares.

WSJ Heard - NYSE trying to develop worldwide exchange (Global Equity Market)
- has approached exchanges throughout the world - but not the NASDAQ.

VenturCom - soft that turns Windows OS into handling Industrial Apps - (e.g.
controlling traffic lights in LA).

RePlay TV - giving product to winners of MTV Movie awards - get the stars
hooked on interactive TV.

MSFT - targeting Palm with ad campaigne for Pocket PC - Palm people say
WinCE should be called "wince".

Cable and Wireless Optus - provide Australia with ASP infrast. - helped by
C&W, CPQ and MSFT alliance.

CSCO - watches MSFT and pushes a be very nice to Uncle Sam approach to Gov.
relations.

FirstMark Commun. - building broadband wireless network in Europe - raises
over $1Billion in equity and loans from blue ribbon backers - KKR, MWD, GS,

Dear Mr. Skilling,

 My name is Chris Weekley and I am David and Bonnie Weekley=01,s son.   I a=

writing because I am in search of a summer internship (paid or non-paid).  =
I
recently had out of town plans fall through and this is why I am beginning

majoring in Human and Organization Development with a focus on Leadership
Effectiveness.  This major studies organizations and the human interactions
that allow them to effectively operate.  I have taken various courses in
organizational theory, economics and human relations.   I think it would be=
 a
great opportunity for me to gain experience within Enron.  I would be more
than happy with any type of job from research to customer relations.  For t=

first three weeks of summer I will be a counselor at a Christian sports cam=

leaving me available from June 11th until August 8th.  I am trying to tie
something down in the next few days prior to my departure for camp if at al=

possible.  Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Chris Weekley

I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

>From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

John

Jeff, 

My sister is a Vice President for JPMorgan Chase Bank, and she supervises 
construction and management of new buildings in Texas. She sent me the 
following note regarding Enron Energy Services' handling of their utility 
bills:

"On another note:  Enron handles the utility bills for JPMorganChase Bank on
a national basis, including Texas.  We are building a call center in San
Antonio, and the City of San Antonio (municipal electric) wants to charge
us a $50,000 deposit for new power because 11 out of the last 12 payments
made by Enron have been late, and late fees have been paid.  I am now going
to do an analysis on all of my regions.  I would like a local Enron
contact, if one exists.  Any ideas?"

Whom in Enron should I tell her to contact?

Thanks,

Steve Bailey

January 15, 2000

 Accompanied by the pleasing rat-a-tat-rat of the train wheels slapping the
joints between the rails, we are pulled slowly towards Istanbul.  Adana's (a
city of 1.6 million some 560 miles southeast of Istanbul) cement clutter and
jumbled sprawl are behind us.  It is night now and I imagine this exhausted
land moaning with relief as it is allowed a brief respite until dawn.  Fires
spot the darkened fields -- fields that have been fields longer than any on
this earth.  The silhouettes of men, going about some mysterious chores,
blink out the orange flames from time to time.  I can make out a ragged
black skyline of mountains to the north, scattered before them clumps of
lights marking towns.

Poised above it all, as if balanced by its handle on the palm of some
invisible giant, is the Big Dipper.  The handle points, roughly, in the
direction of Istanbul.  And from the dipper, onto that monstrous city, some
heavenly pap must certainly pour.  Having these last few days traveled
through a tired land full of people beleaguered by poverty, I have new
respect for that ancient town.  Thinking of it now, Istanbul seems imbued
with an almost childlike spunk, and an impressive set of toys with which to
amuse.

 Earlier in the day in Antakya (ancient Antioch, another 120 miles further
southeast of Istanbul), I had just boarded the bus for Adana when a little
girl started saying out loud, to her mother, the names of cities and towns,
some of which she must have seen on road signs.  "Iskenderun", "Adana", she
pronounced slowly and carefully.  "Kirikhan", "Dortyol," she continued.
Then she said "Istanbul", with the same care. But it had obviously pleased
her more than the rest, because she repeated it many times, each time with a
bit more zeal, until it finally sounded like a marvelous one-word song.
"Is-stawn-bul, Is-stawn-bul", she sang out sweetly, her lyric sometimes
punctuated with a short burst of the giggles.  "Is-stawn-bul!",
"Is-stawn-bul!"   I doubt I will ever hear or read or say the name again
without hearing her little song.  Even now, I am humming its happy tune.

And you may ask, "Where was the mother?"  Smiling, I suppose.  And dreaming
of Istanbul.

Mom and Dad,

I will be sure to tell her.? Any other news?? Will send you an update soon. 
All goes well.? 

Macedonia surprisingly impressive; green valleys tucked in between 
snow-dusted mountains, neat farms and villages and?not?as desperately poor as 
I had read (at least as this all appeared from the window of the plane).? We 
happened to arrive at the same time Secretary of State Colin Powell; the 
airport was surrounded by several helicopters hovering like dragonflies; road 
into town lined with KFOR (from Kosovo, just 30 km away) soldiers and local 
police; we got delayed for 20 minutes or so as Powell's motorcade?passed, 
reminding me of a time when I was stuck in a similar traffic jam in Chicago 
caused by the passing of father Bush.? While there we met with a pimply-faced 
Minister of Transportation and?made little progress in our negotiations as 
deal breaking "collateral" issue came up;?I had a nice evening stoll through 
the old ruins of an Ottoman fort and dropped in on an Eastern Orthodox church 
ceremony (which I found beautiful though a b! it creepy, as the worshipping 
spaces in their churches are small, crowded with the pious and?made to seem 
further cramped by the smoke of incense?and walls completely covered with 
icons).? Heard no gun fire or bomb blasts from the nearby hills, where 
recently some Albanian rebels complaining of an absence of political adn 
economic rights had been trying to mess things up a bit.? I was told by 
local, non-Albanians, that the trouble had been exaggerated by the western 
press.? All very interesting.? Details will be in the book!

Love, 

Mark ???

Tom,

You don't know how nice it is receiving your e-mails, and to hear how
excited you are.  There's no Hemingway in the making here, but I see you
know that he got his start as a journalist.  Did you also know his first
serious work was covering the the two Balkan wars (1912-14) in the city of
Erdine (the Greek, and more famous, name is Adrianople), which is just west
of here on what is now the border of Turkey and Greece.  (I visited Erdine
several months ago; its another messy, beautiful Turkish town.)   Some
historians consider these wars to really be part of World War I.  And I
guess he witnessed part of the huge cross-migrations of Turks and Greeks,
when at the foundation of the Turkish Republic (1923) hundreds of thousands
of Greeks left Turkey and hundreds of thousands of Turks left Greece.  (Both
counties were previously part of the more tolerant Ottoman Empire, the
existence of which was destroyed by the rise of nationalism in the last two
centuries.)  This migration, a tragedy of epic proportions (know now simply
as the "Mubadele [The Exchange]" in Turkish) was probably one of the first
examples of large scale ethnic cleansing.

About having gone through a lot, not true.  Today is beautiful day here in
Istanbul, pleasantly cool (after an awfully hot and humid summer), the air
cleared by a nightime rain.  It was tough to imagine the pain and hardship
going on just several miles west and east of here, to which now is added mud
and cold.  This morning I taught my students (at the Istanbul branch office
of a German company that makes silicon and silicon products) the English
expression "Every dark cloud has a silver lining"  I feel I've lived my
life, when not under perfectly clear skies, in the silver linings.

More later.  I too am excited to see what happens between now and tomorrow's
deadline.  Will keep you secretly (i.e. bcc) posted.

Hope you got a good night's sleep.

Mark

Subject: Re: earthquake---are you all right?



Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a
block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men
reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about;
mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like
after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

Hi, Mark.  The itinerary is changing a little bit with regard to where you 
are staying while in Africa, so I will forward the latest and greatest as 
soon as I get it.  Probably sometime late this week...

Just wanted to be sure that you are working on getting your Tanzanian visa 
and getting the required shots.

Congratulations on the new job - I guess this means you'll be staying for a 
while?

Sherri

Got the list and will begin contacting/meeting with recommended individuals 
immediately.

Summary on the Legal opinion is essentially the following:
 
As long as no public funds are utilized to provide support to the search 
committee and/or its efforts, information obtained/compiled by the committee 
is not considered public information. However, any documented information 
that I or the committee exchange with the City is considered public 
information. The City may provide support to the committee only to facilitate 
the committee's contact with the persons or groups that will provide input. 

City has agreed with recommendation of placement of Advertisement with the 
International Association of Fire Chiefs and it is now due to appear in the 
Classified section of the next issue (Feb. 1 distribution and web posting) of 
International Fire Chiefs' "On Scene" magazine.

City was very pleased with efforts utilized to compile potential candidate 
list (City does not have this list but Ted Bland & Exec Recruiters do.) As a 
matter of fact, TriData's Fire Chief recommendation was already included on 
the list.

I told you I'd be back!  Hopefully, the ease of today's electronic input
will help facilitate your response to our YPO Education Survey.  Therefore,
please complete the attached.

Since the initial response rate was not that great, I have begun discussions
with Hulk Hogan and The Rock.  Hopefully, we won't have to "go to the mat"
with them.

Please remember, we would like one survey completed by yourself and an
additional, separate survey completed by your spouse.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Jeff:

I am sending you a business plan for a financial SettlementMatrix.  This is a
marketplace that will handle all payments, settlements and risk/arbitrage
associated with B2B marketplaces.

I would like to discuss the potential for Enron to participate as an equity
owner in SettlementMatrix.  We are moving this very rapidly.  I will discuss
this with you when we talk on Wednesday.

Regards,
Greg

January 1, 2000

Earlier, with some trepidation, I turned on my laptop, opened up Word
(Microsoft's word processing program) and, once there, my journal.  I typed
in "January".  Before I could go on, however, Mr. Gates' program proudly
displayed the fact it knew where I was going, anticipating a date.  The
program guessed the date would be "January 1, 2000".  It was right.  I
smiled to myself at what seemed, at the moment, a bit of bravado.  I was
also pleased that I had apparently been left unbitten by the dreaded Y2K
bug, as had (I understood from the news reports) most of the rest of the
world.

I am happily settling down to a quiet Saturday night alone, after a
(slightly) booze-soaked Friday night of saying a great big "hey" to the new
millenium.  Last night my girlfriend Sukran and I had gone to my friend
Ismail's, joining his family and a dozen or so of his friends.  We drank
wine and raki (the Turkish version of the anise-based liquor that is
reported to have helped kill, among others, Turkey's founding father Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk).  We listened to and sang (here, I have to admit, I was still
mostly listening) Turkish songs, as well as a few by Bob Dylan (with me
privately concluding that "Blowing in the Wind", after hearing it again
after so many years, was the song of the century).

Closer to midnight we turned on the television, watched the view from the
air of Istanbul's magnificent Blue Mosque, set ablaze by its powerful
floodlights.  A smallish crowd, reported to be about 1,000, would later
watch a modest fireworks display there.  The TV switched to another aerial
view, this time of Istanbul's Taksim Square.  Though the square can fairly
described as Istanbul's Times Square, the crowd there, which I later learned
was overwhelmingly male, could not have numbered more than a few tens of
thousands.  At midnight the TV was shut off and we gathered around Ismail's
seventh floor windows.  From there we watched his neighbors, apparently
observing an age-old New Year's tradition in his neighborhood (Kurtulus),
dropped empty bottles from their windows into the street below.  The roof of
a Mercedes was dented.  Taxies wove their way between exploded bottles,
which on the pavement below -- from my somewhat alcohol-laced, seven-story
high perspective -- looked like giant snowflakes.  People hung from windows
along both sides of the street, some waving sparklers and shouting.  Passing
cars, ignoring the threat from above, tooted their horns merrily.  In the
distance was the sound of fireworks coming from Taksim and the sky, already
hazy from the ubiquitous smog, became spotted with clouds of drifting
gunpowder smoke.

As the night went on (and delightfully on) I learned that every one of the
couples at Ismail's, including Sukran and me, had had a serious fight
earlier in what was now the previous day.  I was surprised by this and
wondered (without reaching any conclusions) what it might have been about
the day that triggered such behavior.  Yet despite the troubling things
inspired by the final few moments of the last particularly wonderful and
terrible century, all were forgotten in the first few moments of the next
(and still undescribable) one -- replaced for the time being by smiles,
songs and much laughter.

And indeed it appears the night passed in a similarly positive fashion
worldwide.  Threats here in Turkey of attacks on millenium celebrations by
Islamic radicals -- apparently offended by both the booze and the brouhaha
over the passing of a date on the Christian calendar -- proved empty (or
perhaps frustrated by the conspicuous number of police).  Nothing else of
that kind, or of any other kind of awfulness, appeared to have occurred
anywhere in the world.  Even the Y2K bug seems to have been born without a
stinger.  What a nice way to start the new year/decade/century/millenium.

Dear Jeff,

Congratulations on your promotion!  I'm sure you already know how well 
everyone in the ranks is receiving the news.  You and Enron are truly amazing.

I really want to thank you, again, for helping me get involved.  It continues 
to be an exhilarating experience, and it has meant a lot to me personally for 
a number of reasons.  If I can ever help you in any way, just say the word!

Warmest personal regards,
Vince

Hello Jeff

A voice from the past.  Hope you are doing well.

I wanted to gain your assistance to point me to the most appropriate person
I could interview at Enron.  I am helping a client understand how companies
in the US Natural Gas and Power industry are coping with the challenges in
their industry in terms of developing and retaining the "right skills".
So, someone who could provide an external perspective of how players in the
industry are coping with the challenges as well as an internal perspective
on Enron would be great for me to interview.  If that means more than one
individual, that is fine too.

Hope this is not too much of an imposition.  I'll undertake the
conversation over the telephone and keep it short.

You can reach me on email: sgiridha@prismintl.com or on my cell phone:
240-603-6084.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Shyam Giridharadas

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Erica Harris

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is

Thank you for taking the time to stop and speak with my wife and I at the EES 
Christmas Party.  We realize you had numerous people to meet and greet.  I 
was serious and very sincere when I said that Enron, under your leadership, 
has grown into one of the most successful and innovative companies in the 
world.  

I am personally looking forward to being a major part of Enron's future.  
Have a wonderful Holiday season and I look forward to a 2001 that is beyond 
anyone's expectations.

Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling 
President and COO 
Enron Corporation 

Dear Mr. Skilling: 

As part of CERAWeek 2001, you are cordially invited to participate in the 
Leadership Circle, an exclusive program for senior executives to be held in 
Houston, Texas, February 11-16, 2001, in conjunction with CERAWeek 2001 and 
our 20th annual Executive Conference. 

The Leadership Circle has become a highlight of our annual conference, 
bringing together a very high-level, select group of government ministers and 
energy decision makers for informal discussions as well as substantive 
presentations on issues of common concern.

Our focus this year is energy market turmoil and its effect on investment 
strategies, regulatory backlash, and industry structure.? We will also 
discuss the postelection prospects for the economy and US politics. Note that 
we have extended the program in response to member suggestions and have 
included recreational activities on Sunday, February 11, and a reception that 
evening at the unique Paraiso Maravilla in Houston, as well as a special 
Summit on Energy Supply and Investment on Monday morning.

Jeff,
For what it is worth, I  wanted to provide my recommendations of individuals 
to oversee the Program.  The major business units should be represented so 
that there is not a perception that any unit is more important than another.  
Additionally, if they have all bought in and agree it should make the 
facilitation of rotations, etc. less difficult to accomplish.  It should be a 
very small group and consist of individuals who are well respected in the 
organization.

Dave Delainey - ENA   (ENA has 50% of the Associates and Analysts and Dave 
has been very supportive of the Programs' objectives.  He has facilitated one 
of the Super Saturdays and offered to do others.  He has also agreed to 
facilitate the Associate PRC).

Dan Leff - EES  ( Dan is the role model in the organization for leadership 
and support of the goals and objectives of the Program and the Company.  At 
his direction, his entire organization has been involved in the recruiting 
process and the rotation process.  He actually set up a Steering Committee of 
his senior executives who meet with Program Management on a monthly basis  
regarding the Associates/Analysts.  Dan has been extremely supportive from 
day one, prior to anyone being told it would affect their PRC rating.  He is 
also the Executive lead on two (2) schools.  The recruiters, candidates, 
staffers and Associates & Analysts love him.  If I had to choose one person 
in the organization whom I would give an award for his dedication to and 
participation in the Program, it would be Dan. )

Jim Fallon - EBS  (Jim has shown greater involvement in the Program lately.  
He has interviewed on Super Saturday on several occasions and has agreed to 
chair the Analyst PRC)

John Sherriff - London (There continues to be a disconnect between London and 
Houston.  It would be helpful to have John actively involved.)

Thanks
Charlene

Jeff, I've attached a copy of the letter describing
the loan of the Madeline O'Connor piece to the McNay
Museum in San Antonio this summer. Please let me or
Betty Moody at Moody Gallery know if you have any
questions. Also, have you had a chance to make a
decision about a piece for the niche between the boys'
rooms? Thanks. Leigh Edwards

Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, 
but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy 
travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has 
turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit 
the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. 
Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

Subject: Luminant



Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

>NEWS FLASH - World  Series Outcome On Hold !!!!!! 
?
NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are  going
to? court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5  ofthe
World Series.? The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the  Mets
held a press conference earlier today.? They were joined by members  of
the Major League Players Union.? "We meant to hit those pitches from  the
Yankee pitchers," said the Mets batting coach.? "We were confused by  the
irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been  denied
our right to hit."
?
One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets  batters
had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve  balls.? It
was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve  balls, though
a much higher percentage were not confused by the  pitches.? Reporters at
the press conference pointed out that the Mets  had extensively reviewed
film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World  Series and had infact faced
the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the  year.? "The fact remains
that some of the pitches confused us and denied  us of our right to hit,"
said the Mets batting coach. "The World Series is  not over yet and the
Yankees are celebrating prematurely."
?
Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World  Series
games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of  each
game.? "While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in  fact,
balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the  World
series," the commissioner said.
?
Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on  on-base
percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardlessof  the
final scores of the games.? "It's clear that we were slightly  on-base
more often than the Yankees," said a Mets spokesman.? "The World  Series
crown is rightly ours."? The manager of the Mets has remained in  relative
seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise.? He has  stated
that he believes "we need to let the process run its course without  
rush to judgment."

We have received numerous requests from individuals in the business units who 
either want to add someone to the PRC Committee or who want to have someone 
attend the Associate and/or Analyst PRC meetings because they do not have a 
representative on the Committees.  

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time 
because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the 
existing PRC Reps.  Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next 
week, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather 
information.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and 
Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional 
Reps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names 
to Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments 
were as follows:

The person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by 
the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company
The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents
The Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors

The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for 
several reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain 
additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond 
their business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC 
Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if 
they are required to disagree with a more senior individual.  

We have also received request from individuals wanting to "observe" the 
meeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just 
observe if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the 
major units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division 
represented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining 
why the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates' & 
Analysts' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts 
in the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps' 
responsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates' and Analysts' 
managers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate 
objectively for the individual.
Also, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or 
impossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.  

I hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they 
should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.

Thanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.

Charlene

Subject: US Officials Dismiss Rumors Of Power Market Price Caps


  By Bryan Lee

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Speculation that U.S. regulators would impose
price
caps on competitive power markets sent several sector stocks into a tumble
this
week.
  But officials with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the
U.S.
Department of Energy Tuesday called the speculation unfounded.
  "We're not discussing (price controls)," said FERC Commissioner Curtis
Hebert.
  "This is the first I've heard of it," said FERC Commissioner William
Massey.
  "I am not aware and have not been involved in any discussion related to
generic application of price caps," Massey said.
  A senior Energy Department official dismissed a rumor that Energy
Secretary
Bill Richardson had asked FERC to consider price caps as a response to
potential power grid outages this summer.
  "We have not at all talked about price caps with FERC," the Energy
Department
official said, adding: "We do not intend to get involved in that issue."
  The comments came after shares of several companies active in the
converging
natural gas and power sectors took a severe hit Monday in response to
concerns
that the regulators would cap power prices, which would limit revenue from
gas-fired generation investments.
  Shares of Dynegy Inc. (DYN) dropped 8.6% on Monday, while Enron Corp.
(ENE)
and El Paso Energy Corp. (EPG) saw their stocks fall 4.9% and 5%. Calpine
Corp.
(CPN) took the hardest fall, losing 12% of its share value.
  Wall Street analysts attributed the sell-off to profit-taking and an
unfounded
reaction to speculation in a Prudential Securities note to investors
regarding
the potential for FERC to intervene in competitive power markets.
  The June article, written by Carol Coale, a Houston-based analyst with
Prudential, said FERC "is proposing to endorse price caps on electricity to
prevent brownouts and other reliability issues."
  Coale warned that this "could significantly limit the profitability" of
gas-fired generation investments by Dynegy, Enron, El Paso and Duke Energy
(DUK), which also saw share values tumble this week.
  These companies developing gas-fired power plants could see their
profitability affected "if the FERC were to actually take such action,"
Coale
wrote.

  (MORE) DOW JONES NEWS  06-06-00
  03:24 PM- - 03 24 PM EDT 06-06-00
  "My comments triggered a knee-jerk reaction," Coale said Tuesday.
  "It's interesting to see how one small comment gets blown up," she said.
  Coale joined other analysts Tuesday in saying investors overreacted, and
suggested that Monday's sell-off might present a good opportunity to buy the
companies' stocks.
  "We do not believe the government is interested in nationwide power price
caps," said James Yannello, an analyst with PaineWebber, in a note to
investors
Tuesday.
  "We see the recent pullback...as an excellent buying opportunity," Yanello
said.
  Coale said the ground was laid for Monday's stock dive when Dynegy issued
a
press release Friday urging FERC "to resist the temptation to endorse price
caps."
  The possibility of price caps was raised by Dynegy and others in response
to
FERC's May 17 notice seeking comments on actions the regulators can take
this
summer to assure power grid reliability.
  While those comments urged the commission against considering price
controls,
the mere discussion of capping the steep spikes in power prices during
transmission grid constraints spooked investors Monday.
  Massey, the FERC commissioner, noted that the commission has never imposed
price caps on the competitive wholesale power markets its regulations helped
bring about.
  FERC has imposed price caps only in certain markets for "ancillary
services,"
the term used for electricity generation necessary to assure grid
reliability,
Massey said.
  "The price caps at the wholesale level are few and far between, and for
the
most part are very generous," Massey said.
  The grid-reliability measures FERC proposed May 17 would allow industrial
generators to sell power into the grid at prevailing market rates, or to get
paid for not using electricity, during a grid-reliability emergency, Massey
noted.
  Hebert, the lone Republican commissioner who has consistently voted
against
the FERC majority Democrats in allowing the price caps, said the stock
market's
reaction this week validates his arguments against price controls.
  "Investors see their opportunity to earn being inhibited by FERC," Hebert
said. "This is evidence of what I've been talking about. Price controls
consistently inhibit the market."
  The stock performance of these companies will continue to be overshadowed
by
uncertainty until FERC announces its "final decision" on power grid
reliability, Coale said in a followup note to investors Tuesday.
  "While we do not see a trend for the FERC to re-regulate the wholesale
electricity market, we do see a trend in its propensity to approve temporary
price caps in certain illiquid markets," Coale said.

Jeff,

How's it going in the world of energy?  I enjoy reading about you and your
adventures. Sounds like you might be having a little fun as well.

Attached is a resume from an acquaintance of mine.  Nice guy and would be
credit to anyone's organization.  Thought you  might forward it to
personnel.

Don't forget you've got a lifetime warranty on the drywall in your house.
My compliments.  Call me if you have any problems.  Also I walked your new
building last week.  Quite impressive, especially what we're having to
build on a tight schedule.  Should really be nice.  If you'd like a
personal tour, let me know.  I'd love to put you in a hardhat and introduce
you to the team that's doing all the work.  Would make a great shot for my
in-house publication and maybe yours as well.

Miss seeing you at our Forum meetings.  WPO is not as much fun as YPO.
Enjoy it while you can!

-Stan

Hi Stan:

It was good to meet you this morning. I've enjoyed working out with Joel;
he's a good "kid" and I can certainly relate to his Midwest roots and Iowa
State background. I grew up on a grain/livestock farm in Gladbrook, Iowa, a
town of under 1,000 people, and did my BS at Iowa State and MBA at Kansas
University.

I'm currently working as Director, Business Development at RedMeteor.com,
an
internet-based energy brokerage company. We compete against Altra Energy,
EnronOnline, InterContinentalExchange and HoustonStreet. We started with
$22
million in venture capital, but need an additional infusion of capital to
build out our business model. I think it's going to be difficult for us to
attract additional funding in this climate, so I'm interested in making a
move to another employer when I find the right fit.

As I mentioned this morning, I've been talking with Conoco recently (my
previous employer for 9 years) as well as Enron's Broadband Services group.
I'm looking for a Houston-based business development position that would
build on my eCommerce experience at RedMeteor or my oil & gas pipeline
operations background. I've also met with Reliant Energy recently although
I
understand they've suspended hiring in their trading/eCommerce groups due
to
the California crisis.

Any suggestions you would have would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.

Jeff,
We've never met, but as a long time geophysical consultant to EOG and now
EGEP I thought I'd send a congratulatory  note from a fellow MS150 rider on
your top fundraising achievement announced last night at the Awards evening.
It's good to know that there's time to ride in what must be a very busy
schedule.

As you know, the ENA gas floor came in with a $30 million VAR position 
today.  Even though this left us with another $10 million of unused VAR, I 
want to make you aware that we may exceed our VAR limit today. This move up 
was much bigger than the market anticipated, and natural gas volatility was 
up quite a bit. The VAR calculation is now kicked off at 2:00am and we will 
know our VAR position by 6:00am.  If we are over, I will need to ask for a 
one day increase.  I have already told the desk heads that we will most 
likely need to sell some contracts tonight and tomorrow.

Thanks for the reply Sherri.  I missed Jeff last night at Paul's so we
didn't get a chance to talk.  Paul and I would appreciate the opportunity to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given
everyone's tight schedules, but please find below some dates that work for
Paul and me:

Dec 11 afternoon; Dec 12 afternoon; Dec 13 10:30-2:00; Dec 15 afternoon; Dec
18/19/21 all day

Please let me know if any of these dates work so we can set a firm time.  If
Jeff wants to combine with lunch, that would be great too.  Thanks/Neil.

Dear Neil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he will be at Paul Hobby's open house
this evening and hopes to see you there to discuss Genesis Park and Vitol.
In the event you two do not cross paths there, please let me know and we'll
see what we can do to schedule a meeting before the end of the year.

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Subject: Enron Candidate


Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke 
with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in 
financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set 
relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also 
interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; 
likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of 
the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am 
highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston 
through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any 
opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

"Ajunto is the Enron of IT Sourcing..." ---  Mike Carter, CEO & Founder,
Ajunto, December 12,  2000

"Skilling notes that  skeptics thought Enron was crazy when it dared to
make  electronic
?markets in energy. His confidence comes  down to his belief in Enron's
market-making model.
?"We have a better business model.  It's a fundamentally better business
model," he repeats.
?Some $200 billion in trading  activity on an E-commerce site that's less
than a year old speaks
?volumes about Enron's  ability to mobilize and execute on whatever it puts
its mind  to-however
?the company decides to describe  itself."
InformationWeek,  11/6/00

"As head of two Enron  pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot
more about gas flows
?than he did about data flows last year  when he got a surprise call from
Enron President and
?Chief Operating Officer Jeff  Skilling. Recalls McConnell, "Jeff went into
this whole  thought
?process about how the Internet is changing  everything. He said, 'We need
to make Enron
?an e-business, and I need a guy that can  run this as a business. We need
to change the way
?we view technology.'?? "I thought he was a little crazy and I  said,
'Jeff, I'm not a technology person
?at all,? ?'He  said, 'No, seriously -- this is going to be big.' So I took
over as CEO of  Enron Global
?Technology," and thus became the company's  de facto CIO, McConnell
explains.

Great to hear from you!  I got both messages.

How fun about Suleyman's fabric samples.  Hope they aren't the last
straw that broke the camel's back.  (Oh yeah, no camels here in Turkey;
for reference, Turkey's southern coast same latitude as SF.)  It would
be great if you two could work together.  I really like Suleyman and if
you could help him get into US market it would be a coup for him.  And,
maybe, you and Jeff will get to Turkey!  By the way (which, by the way,
happens to be Suleyman's favorite transitional phrase] Suleyman very
informal; so don't be afraid to get into an extended dialogue with him,
in which you ask a lot of preliminary questions.   Anyway, it would be
good for his English.

Thinking of you "up north" very nice.  Guess the lakes are still socked
in, but beautiful and pristine.  I spent the day in one of Istanbul's
sprawling, slapped together neighborhoods, where a lot of refugees from
the Balkins have settled over the years.  Recently, it was the site of
PKK (i.e. Kurdish] riots.  Wanted to see it.  Impressive bit of
improvising; a testimony to we humans' endless ability to adapt and make
lives for ourselves.  Think about what Istanbul's been through.  In 1970
its population was about 1.5 million.  Now its approaching 15 million,
and most of the new comers are dirt poor folks moving in from the
countryside.  It's slapped together, but works pretty damn well.  Bravo!

I guess a bomb went off nearby and someone was killed.  Always a few
folks looking for the quick reconciliation of irreconcilable, competing
differences.

All the above pretty vague; a writer's dilemma is to make it live for
the reader.  But there's just so much "stuff" that makes up any given
piece of reality, and its ultimately in the eye of the beholder anyway.
This is some thing I've set out to try and do; to get my arms around a
bit of everything!  A dwarfing, humbling endeavor; like trying to single
handedly to capture all the water from a ruptured dam.

More later.  Good luck with all you do.

Love,

Dear Mr. Skilling:

We are selling the title sponsorship of Atlanta=01,s Lenox Square, the most

decade. This is an outstanding deal, priced below naming rights of stadium
and arena deals done recently. Simon Property Group, the leader in the
shopping mall industry, owns and operates Lenox and this is their first
naming rights deal. Do you have interest? If so, please contact me at your
earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Scheduled for Febr. 1 at 2pm.

Location - at a fire station in a Hispanic Community - exact location will be 
forwarded shortly but estimated distance from ENE office = less than 15 min.

Expect News Conference to last a total of 30 minutes, including Q&A. Jeff 
Skilling will be spokesperson for Selection Committee. However, we will try 
to have as many committee members present as possible. 

Mayor will likely discuss (estimated time = 10 min.):
 - changes that are required at HFD - potential need to bring in an outsider, 
etc...
 - reasoning behind involvement of Enron/Jeff Skilling & formation of 
selection committee - de-politicize the process, etc...

JS should speak about the following (estimated time = 10-15 min.):
 - how he became involved in the process
 - how the committee members were selected
 - who the members are with a brief background on each (We plan to provide a 
bio on each of the committee members as part of the press release)
 - time line for Fire Chief selection 

Q&A (estimated time = 5-10 min.)
 - expect questions along the lines of: Are the meetings going to be open or 
closed?, Outsider vs. Insider related questions...

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/issues with the above. 
I'll coordinate collection of Bios from Committee members. Anything else I 
can do to help out here?

Lisa

Dear Mr. Morgan,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to speak 
to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat 
intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his time, he 
must respectfully decline your invitation.

Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level 
representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do what 
I can to facilitate that for you.

Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the the 
opportunity.

Regards,

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the "truth").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a "special" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ronnie Morgan

Dear Mr Jeffrey K Skilling:

With click-through rates plunging all over the World Wide Web, conventional 
wisdom says that Internet portals no longer have a legitimate place in 
consumer marketing plans.

An exclusive analysis by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, however, paints an entirely 
different picture.  True...the role of portals has changed, but the change 
has made them even more potent than before.  Instead of mere gateways, 
portals are centers of content and commerce that draw audiences in the same 
way that large-circulation magazines and successful TV networks do.

Major changes are taking place in terms of banner advertising, search engine 
use, per-click pricing, and the way business is done on the Internet.  But 
the truly amazing aspect of all this is that portals are still changing.  
First they were gateways, now they are destinations...what will the next 
phase be?  And what will it mean to you?

To find the answers to those questions, I suggest that you carefully read 
"The Great Portal Payoff" by Horacio D. Rozanski and Gerry Bollman in the 
upcoming issue of strategy+business.

When you do, you will see why strategy+business is so eagerly awaited by the 
select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send 
complimentary issues.

While we are on the subject, I should mention that our records indicate you 
have been receiving s+b since Jun 16 00.  There is no reason why you cannot 
keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...but it would be best if 
you make arrangements right now to extend your subscription.

To make sure you continue receiving your complimentary strategy+business 
subscription, just click on the following link:

http://www.sbsubscriber.com/services/cg.cfm?D=20010514131313&N=243499.0&R=381.

Dear Neil,

If you can come to ours, it would be greatly appreciated.  We're located at
1400 Smith Street, Suite 5007.  You can park in the Allen Center Garage
visitor parking (entrances off of Clay and Andrews Streets), which is
connected to our building by a skywalk on the 3rd floor.  You'll have to
check in with security in the lobby of our building, but I'll let them know
you and Paul are expected so as to expedite the process.  Will anyone else
be accompanying you?  Please advise.  Thank you.

to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Hello Jeff

A voice from the past.  Hope you are doing well.

I wanted to gain your assistance to point me to the most appropriate person
I could interview at Enron.  I am helping a client understand how companies
in the US Natural Gas and Power industry are coping with the challenges in
their industry in terms of developing and retaining the "right skills".
So, someone who could provide an external perspective of how players in the
industry are coping with the challenges as well as an internal perspective
on Enron would be great for me to interview.  If that means more than one
individual, that is fine too.

Hope this is not too much of an imposition.  I'll undertake the
conversation over the telephone and keep it short.

You can reach me on email: sgiridha@prismintl.com or on my cell phone:
240-603-6084.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Shyam Giridharadas

Mr. Skilling:

Your P number is P00500599.  For your convenience, you can also go to 
http://isc.enron.com/site/ under Site Highlights and reset your password or 
find your "P" number.

Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and 
co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to 
speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular "5 minutes") about his company.  Jeff has 
asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 
617.493.5597.

(Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse 
- i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do).

Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to 
Franz.

SRS

PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for 
you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his 
family to Houston...

Joannie,

I'm back in town and have everything set for Friday AM at 9.  I am also
going to Hobby Performing Arts immediately afterwards with Paul Hobby and
we'd love to have Jeff join us for a short tour of that job as well.

Thanks,

Jeff,

This sort narrowed the search considerably.  I'm having hard copies that I've 
organized by city (makes it quicker to look at) hand carried to you.  The 
1959 info should be coming in a couple of days.  If this approach doesn't 
find the person, I have another idea.

Thanks,
Billy

I want to document my appreciation for your efforts and attitude during this 
incident.  You showed compassion and moved quickly to resolve the issue.  
There was no hesitation on April's part to make loans to Jenny and me.  
Compensatory efforts have resulted in April taking Jenny and me to lunch, Amy 
initiating and funding another lunch for us and Dave Parquet mandating us 
four hours pay for waiting at home on a Saturday to recieve replacement 
checks via Fedex that turned out to be non-negotiable.

I have cc'd Jeff Skilling because I believe he needs to know that he has very 
efficient and compassionate people working for Enron.  April, Amy and 
Cristina, thank you for being yourselves.

Rick,

With the recent burst of the Internet and communications bubble in the public 
equity markets, I wanted to send you an email describing our position, 
exposure and ongoing strategy.  Our aggressive use of accounting management 
vehicles, and early sales of positions has significantly reduced our 
accounting volatility and economic exposure.  Hopefully, the following points 
will address the appropriate issues.

Currently we have invested $108 million in 22 companies.  Of that, 
approximately $80 million still has accounting exposure.  The other $28 
million invested has either been hedged or already written down.  Our 
disciplined use of Fair Value accounting has allowed us to minimize 
accounting risk by not writing up investments simply because of improving 
market conditions.
Specifically - Avici, Sycamore, and FastForward have generated approximately 
$180 million in earnings this year.  DEN, Salus Media, and IAM.com have 
combined for $9 million in writeoffs.
Recently, I have done a review of our portfolio and I believe our accounting 
loss exposure for 2001 is limited.  Over 80% of our portfolio companies have 
raised enough capital to sustain them through all of 2001.  So, if the 
markets (private and public) are closed, I do not believe these companies 
will risk bankruptcy during 2001.  Also, our discipline of only co-investing 
with big partners helps assure these companies will continue to get funding.

Going forward, we are making certain revisions to our strategy to take 
compensate for, and take advantage of, the weak markets.
Limiting venture investments to technology companies that we have a 
competitive advantage in assessing the technology risk.  Also, moving our 
venture effort earlier stage to take more technology risk and less market 
risk.
We are beginning to look at other types of private equity investments.  There 
are many public companies, whose stock prices are at 10% or less of their 
highs.  I still believe that the fundamentals of the industries indicate that 
the vast majority of these companies will go bankrupt.  However, there will 
be a select few that will survive and will end up with reduced competition 
and big markets.  These companies will be big winners.  We are carefully 
looking for these.  I will keep you informed as this develops.

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Kevin Garland

I'm in one piece; oblivious (if not for the news) of the bombs going off
all around me.  There's close to 15 million people here, so it should
take a while for them to get to me if they go at 13 people increments.

Inappropriate joking aside, what an awful thing.  I wonder at the
strange sort of logic that compels the bastards.  I hope they met as
grisly an end as the ones their handing out.

Did you get my picture?  Looking forward to the basket of goodies.  I
have a mailbox now, so letters should be more secure.

Thanks for the note.  Hope all is well.

Mike, I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the 
presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the 
presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you 
would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the 
SUN demonstration.  

With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone 
contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be 
possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are 
the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone 
numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  

Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we 
have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to 
reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and 
the meeting room set up "class room" style.  If we go with the plated 
breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 "10-tops," there will be no 
space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 
people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing 
to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting 
room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the 
YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and 
will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff 
are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.

I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.  Thanks, SRS

David,

Jeff Skilling, president of Enron, recently asked that I recommend a 
visionary venture capitalists to speak at an upcoming YPO meeting that he is 
hosting.  I recommended that Mr. Skilling contact you as a possible speaker.  
He will likely be calling you in the near future to make this request.  I 
know that you are busy, but would appreciate your consideration in this 
matter.

I hope all is well.

Thanks,

I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom 
Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to 
replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production 
facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell 
owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a "small" holding.  
I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in 
salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original 
cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be 
approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a "going 
concern" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying 
value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and 
MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to 
Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in 
turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held 
July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some 
value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and 
recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.

How I wish all the bosses treat their employees as the man in this story 
did!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
First-Day Employee

My father had a small business, employing approximately fifteen people at any 
given time.  We pasteurized and homogenized milk from farmers each morning, 
and put it into bottles for home use and for restaurants.  We also put the 
milk into small containers for the school kids everyday.  We also made a 
wonderful little thing called homemade ice cream.  We sold all of these milk 
products, and many more, in the front of a dairy building, which had been 
fashioned into a small store with a large soda fountain.  During the summer 
months, there were rows and rows of eager tourists lined up at the ice cream 
counter, waiting for their daily indulgence of my father's most exquisite 
recipes of some twenty-seven flavors of homemade wonder.

Being such an extremely busy little store meant that the employees had to 
work fast and furious for hours at a time, with little rest.  The swarm of 
tourists never stopped and our "rush hour" lasted many hours on hot days.

I had worked for my father since I was young, as did all seven kids in our 
family.  So I had seen many new employees come and go due to the fast and 
frenetic pace. One day, in 1967, we had a new employee, Debbie, who wanted to 
work in the store for the summer.  She had never done this type of work 
before, but planned to give it her all.

On her first day, Debbie made just about every mistake in the book.  She 
added the sales wrong on the cash register, she charged the wrong prices for 
items, she gave the wrong bag of food to the wrong customer, and she dropped 
and broke a half-gallon of milk.  The torture of watching her struggle was 
too much for me.  I went into my father's office and said, "Please go out 
there and put her out of her misery."  I expected him to walk right into the 
store and fire her on the spot.  Since my father's office was situated within 
view of the sales counter, he had no doubt seen what I was talking about. He 
sat, thoughtful, for a moment.  Then he got up from his desk and walked over 
to Debbie, who was standing behind the counter.

"Debbie," he said, as he put his hand gently on her shoulder.  "I have been 
watching you all day, and I saw how you treated Mrs. Forbush."

Debbie's face began to flush and tears began to well in her eyes as she 
struggled to remember Mrs. Forbush from the many women she had given the 
wrong change to or spilled milk on.

My father continued, "I've never seen Mrs. Forbush be so polite to any one of 
my employees before.  You really knew how to handle her.  I am sure that she 
is going to want you to wait on her every time she comes in.  Keep up the 
good work."

In return for being a wise and compassionate employer, my father got a loyal, 
and hardworking employee for sixteen years...and a friend for life.

Dear Ken: 

This note builds on the earlier voice mail, and a memorandum I have sent to  
you, following the Dave Dorman meeting. Given the initial ground work done 
by  
our team at ATT leadership level, the meeting between Jeff and David Dorman,  
we think did go as expected by us. I am sure Dave and Stewart, along with  
Jeff have shared their views of the meeting, and do feel positive about ?the  
process forward. 

Our take on the meeting is as follows: 

1. Dave Dorman is open and eager to explore ways ATT and Enron could  
cooperate across the board. 

2. Dave wants to move fast, but at a pace that will work within ATT, and is  
strategically sound for both the organizations 

3. He is now looking forward to specific value propositions from  
Enron-Adventis team, which he is prepared to discuss with us. 

4. On that basis I am sure he will guide us to the most appropriate guys  
within ATT who will need to understand and act on the value propositions. 

In view of the above the real work begins now. As discussed with Dave and  
Stewart, we will further reinforce our commitment to develop, and take the  
basic proposals with ATT forward. Our team is already on the job and will  
meet with Stewart early this week. 

I did indicate to both Dave and Stewart that we will like to take the next  
steps in a most expeditious and matured fashion so that all the strategic  
possibilities to create the new bandwidth dynamics between the two companies  
could be achieved. 

Given that there were some hesitation within Enron on the out come of the  
first meeting with ATT, we committed to the last 2.5 weeks of work with a  
reduced fee structure. Now that the first major step has been successfully  
taken, we plan to work with you along our normal professional fee schedule.  

As we do want to move as fast as possible and if at any point indications 
are  
that the desired out come will be difficult to achieve we could stop and  
review progress. As a result, although not common, we are willing to work  
with a weekly rate, adjusted to professional fees of $75,000/week and out of  
pocket expenses. In addition of course for an engagement of this nature 
which  
essentially leverages our firms professional credibility and trust in the  
industry, our clients pay us on the basis of successful execution of the  
alliance formation along preset milestones.  

Given the strategic nature of this engagement, and our commitment to assist  
you with all the major Telcos, -- incumbents and new, we will welcome to  
learn from you the basic structure of a formula which Enron is most  
comfortable with; typically in other situations in my professional life, we  
have been rewarded in three stages: 

1. On signing of ?the letter of intent(s) 
2. On ?signing of the agreement(s) 
3. On launch of the first project (s) 

Ken, while we look forward to formalizing the above, please enure we sustain  
and if not increase the momentum gained from the first summit meeting last  
Thursday. If we do the right things, the upside is indeed huge. We of course  
should also start thinking through how to build the same kind of work  
dynamics with the other Telcos, in most we do enjoy similar professional  
trust. 

We will call you tomorrow to firm up the next 3 -4 weeks of ?work --  
documentation of value propositions, actions, meetings, and decisions. 

Regards, 

Partha S Ghosh 

?

Mom and Dad,

Got mom's letter last week; and it only took about a week to get here.
Thanks.  Enjoyed the pictures of Tom.

Mom, you're right about a place to live.  Have a good one here.  A bit
raw by US standards, but perfect for me.  Older building in interesting,
"real" neighborhood; aesthetically pleasing apartment, with wood floors,
ok molding, and super excellent, quintessential Istanbul view.  There
are twelve apartments in the building, most of which are rented by
Moslem families (veils and all).  A couple are used for storage by local
businesses and one is rented by an English journalist.  Will get some
pictures to you someday soon (though not taking many photos so far, as
want to experience this place as much in my brain, where the words are,
as is possible).  Took a while to get my place reasonably comfortable,
as had to buy furniture, etc, but that actually a lot of fun, in a way.
Part of the experience, and I learned a lot.  Even had to install my own
light fixtures.  No central-heating, so use one natural gas and one
electric heater.  Ismail was/is very helpful in all ways, both with
technical support and with help finding bargains.  I've been very lucky.

Not "running" around too much.  Indeed, literally can't run.  Otherwise,
my new hips performing flawlessly and thrilled at the absence of pain
and how strong they are.  Hoping to find an affordable pool around here,
but such things not high on Turkey's needed infrastructure list.  Except
for super expensive pools in the luxury hotels ($25/day), very few pools
in Istanbul.  (Sorry Dad, no golf courses either.)

Haven't worked too hard on trying to paint the "big picture" in my
little blurbs.  But generally, go to Turkish classes three mornings a
week, starting at nine o'clock, for four hours each day.  Study a least
that much on my own, not including trying to have "real life" Turkish
lessons.  Work about 15 hours a week, not including preparation and
travelling time, which almost doubles that figure.  (Since each work
session usually only two hours, spend an inordinate amount of time on
unpaid travelling; so far that's ok, as I enjoy the travelling, because
I get to see odd parts of Istanbul.  That bit of charm will probably
wear off over time.)  Have enjoyed figuring out the transit system, and
have gotten pretty good at using the buses, metro, the dolmas (something
in between buses and taxis).  Cook at home a few times a week -- pasta,
rice and veggies; things like that (there are tiny bakeries and
vegitable stands everywhere)  -- though eating out here can be really
cheap and interesting.  Have two really good Turk friends now; Ismail
and a wonderful women named Sukran (pronounced "Shookrahn").  Spend very
little time with yabanci (foreigners, like me).  We spend a fair amount
of time in cafes (which are bountiful and central to life her) talking
about writing, politics, Turkish, etc.  At least once a week I go on a
long walk through a part of the city I haven't seen yet.  Ismial usually
joins me.  These are always amazing and are probably the most important
part of my life here.  There's a Turkish newspaper that's written in
English, which I try to read most days.  Most days I also visit New York
Times and CNN web cites.  As you can see, taking this all very
seriously, am very busy and am loving every minute of it.

More later.  Working on a blurb about a strange religious holiday we're
in the midst of right now.

Thanks for your interest, which as I've mentioned before important for
me.  And, especially, thanks for keeping in touch.

Love,

Mark

Hi gang!  This is not the weekly training schedule note - just wanted those 
of you who are riding the Tour de Cypress this weekend to know that Stephanie 
Strong will not be picking up your rider packets as she did for the 
Bluebonnet.  She wants to be at the Enron MS150 packet pickup at the Big-E 
Cafe on Friday.

If you haven't yet registered for the Tour de Cypress, you can get more 
information at http://www.bicycletexas.com/houston.htm.

Various Beta Buttheads,
   OK, the deadline is fast approaching.  We're inside two minutes to play
and I need to know the game plan.  As of this day Oct. 2, here's what I have
confirmed in tickets ordered so that we all may sit together at this year's
homecoming game:
Mannino/1, Beek/1, Jordan/1, Artie/1, Wallace/1, Elvis/2, Grumbles/2,
Glass/3, Chuckles/1, J. Miller/2, Shack/1, Space/8 (he's bringing all of
Elzie's living relatives), Hutch/2, Fullerton/2, Coburn/2, Jansson/5 (he's
bringing all of Mom Pinchbeck's living relatives), Rossell/2, and Carl
Hohl/2 (he thinks...not sure because he never was).
    Now, if there are ANY OTHERS, you have about 48 hours because I need to
order these things when I get back in town on the 5th.  So if any of you
reading this want some, give me an email.  Also think about recruiting
others not on my email list that you think might not yet know about all
these plans.
     WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO ROCK THE NEW STADIUM.  I've already
contacted officer Caffey and he's given us yet another reprieve to behave
any damned way we want to, complete with SMU Secuity protection.


Yours in -kai-

Jeff,

Today  I  had a good discussion with David Cox & Scott Yeager about EBS 
development and I'd like to share with you some of our ideas.

The meeting was influenced by our developing relationship with Microsoft.   I 
know that you are taking an active part in building our relationship with 
MSFT and thought  that it might be interesting for you to go through this 
internal discussion paper.  

Best regards,

Boris

Jeffrey,

Wow.  What can I say.  Will it help?  It covers about thirty months of
rent here (and I have a nice place), and makes it nearly certain that I
have the wherewithall to hang in there long enough to give this writing
thing an umitigated shot.  Thanks so very much.

Thanks also for for the kind words in your letter about appreciating
getting my little blurbs.  That means a lot to me.

Your letter capped what was one of my best days here (and I have had a
lot of great days here).  Have met a "harika [wonderful]" Turkish woman,
and had just spent a fine evening with her when I came home and found
your letter.  Her name is Sukran (pronounced "Shoo-kron").  More about
her later.  I have to admit that I cried a bit after I opened your
letter; the culmination of a lot of fantasitic feelings.

It would be great if you got over here.  It's really an endlessly
facinating place, and I think I'm becoming a prtty good guide.  (Also,
Sukran should be helping my Turkish a lot.)  Let me know as far ahead of
time as possible so I can sure you have the best choices of hotels.

I know my blurbs suggest greyness, but that's the most interesting color
for me.  As I mentioned in my last e-mail to you, I'm having the time of
my life.  Indeed, today is the first real day of spring here (though it
may be a false one [ it snowed pretty hard just two weekends ago]) and I
actually sat out in the sun on the porch next to my place and studied
Turkish and prepared my next English lessons.

I recently sent Kristin an "introduction to Istanbul" e-mail (we just
got in touch by e-mail after the holidays); you may want to ask her to
run off a copy for you (assuming she saved it).

Hope you're enjoying your work.  Let me know what else is happening in
your life.  Thanks again for everything.

Love,

Mark

My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is 
sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the 
ballroom at the Rice.   Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, 
our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the 
common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit 
aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial 
reporting, etc.    In addition to managing these databases, Mary has 
harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an 
effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.  This tool can

Tom,

Thanks again fro your thoughtful notes.

Can't say life normal, but in areas without damage not to far away from it.
Plenty of food.  No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normal
loads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxed
by the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the suffering
will be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lot
of suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solid
ground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spent
two of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.
Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and have
been able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, every
open space not too close to a building seems to be filled with people
sleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between things
trees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets made
relatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me how
kind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of one
poor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindely
misplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And what
you read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard by
Russian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkey
all the luck in the world.  It will need it.

Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot of
what they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.

More later.  Nice to know you're thinking about me.  Let dad and mom know
not taking any chances that weren't there already.

Love,

Mark

Dear John,

On May 9, 2000, you sent a cover memo along with a business proposal for CMI 
to Jeff Skilling.  That e-mail was inadvertently deleted, but fortunately not 
before Jeff saw a printed copy.

Jeff has asked that you send that e-mail to Dan Leff in EES for review.  Upon 
his review, a determination will be made as to whether or not Enron will 
pursue this opportunity.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
on behalf of Jeff Skilling

Hi, Kristin,

Your Dad asked me to let you know that he got your message.  He would like to 
meet you at Maggiones (the place you two met for lunch the first time).  I'm 
making a reservation for you guys in his name at 1:00 p.m. 

Would you please reply to this e-mail so I know you got it?  Thanks, Kristin, 
and have a nice lunch.

Sherri

Jeff,  how was the bike trek to Austin?  Hope you raised LOTS of $$$.  Great
job you are doing!  My MS get together is next weekend (May 13th).

Homecoming 2000-be there!  Elvis is having a party for all Beta's (big 25th
reunion) on Friday night at his house.  The new stadium is supposed to be
awesome.  Hope you can make it.

Keep in touch,

Hello Dad;

Happy birthday.  So, it sounds like you will be "batching" it on your
birthday this year.

Read a little about the Sox here; sounds like they're up and down.

Good luck on your speech on Memorial day.  What will it be about?

How was the Lehigh frat reunion?  Are you really playing golf already?
There arn't very many courses here, but did see one recently (it was, of
course, owned by the army).

Hope mom wins the sweepstakes, and the trip to Istanbul. When is the
drawing?  (Did she get my note about mom's day?)

I brag to everyone here about you getting a computor and learning how to use
the Internet; its really quite extraordinay.  Great to be in such good touch
with you all.  Hope to get a connection to my apartment again in late June,
after which I should be able to write more regularly.

Of yeah, Misha and wife Nina coming to Istanbul in a couple of weeks.  Plan
to head out into Anatolia (Asian Turkey) for a week.  Should be great.  Will
get to seriously test my Turkish.  Looking forward to it.

Talk with you soon.

Love,

Mark-O

We're in the middle of the Fed's two day meeting and Tues.'s trading
reflected a degree of nervousness. Everyone is positive that the Fed isn't
going to raise - right? Buyers seemed to be following Prince Hal's adage -
"Discretion is the better part of valor". People sat on the sidelines and
watched Tech fall on it's own weight - there were some buyers - CVS (CVS
Drugstores), WMT (Wal Mart) and HD (Home Depot Inc) up over 5%; RDA (Readers
Digest), ETH (Ethan Allen) and GPS (Gap Inc) over 7% - not exactly cutting
edge names. But Tues trading seemed to scorn anything next generation - HLIT
(Harmonic) down over 40% (after neg pre-announce) AFCI (Advanced Fiber
Comm.) down 16%, WMB (Williams Communications) down 13%, RHAT (Red Hat Inc)
and NSM (National Semiconductor) down 7%, PAIR (Pairgain Technologies) and
ADCT (ADC Telecomm) down 6%, TXN (Texas Instruments) and IBM down 4%
(negative analyst comments on IBM), GLW (Corning Inc), HON (Honeywell
International), INTC (Intel Corp) and SUNW (Sun Microsystems) all down 2% or
more.... some of the laggards of late were in the green - YHOO (Yahoo) and
INKT (Inktomi)both up over 4% but the real feel of the day was reflected in
the Nasdaq (down 50), the Dow Industrials (down 38) and the S&P (down 4.55).
Down - not "panic" down but a "treading water" down. In the CEUT Universe -
AMZN* (Amazon) up over 7%, CTAC* (1800 Contacts) continuing its climb up
over 1, LLL* (L-3 Communications) up 3 (shaking off unfounded talk as
William Kidd said it should), GOAM* (Goamerica) up 8%, PROX* (Proxim) up
almost 2, JBL* (Jabil Circuit) up 1 3/4, BMCS* (BMC Software) up over 1 1/2
- but these were the bright spots in a overall down day - BWAY* (Breakaway
Solutions) down 1 7/8, ITWO* (I2 Technologies) down over 3 1/2, LU* (Lucent
Technologies) down 2, JDSU* (JDS Uniphase) down over 6, ANCR* (Ancor
Communications) down 3, PMCS* (PMC Sierra) down over 5, SSTI* (Silicon
Storage) down over 14, RIMM* (Research In Motion) down over 10 (following
Jason Tsai's downgrade), MUSE* (Micromuse) down over 6, VRTS* (Veritas
Software) down 4, TMPW* (TMP Worlwide) down over 3, ICIX (Intermedia
Communications) down over 2.......... In IPOland - BUSY (Busybox.com)
(images over net) up over 10%, EFDS broke issue bid but closed even, STLW
(Stratos (Lightwave) up over 60%, CKCM (Click Commerce) up over 75% and the
star of the day - MRVL (Marvell Technologies) up over 270% - a flashback to
the last century.  Coming Wed. - Genuity (GENU) - net infrast. to ISPs -

I suspected that we would have no problems, but wanted to be sure we were all 
aware of the issue.

Thanks, and I will miss Enron as well.

Jay,

I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is 
little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" 
right - just give me a call when you've got something.

Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.

Best regards,
Jeff

Subject: My Resignation, and a Question

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley 
about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily 
for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, 
while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it 
is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I 
will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term 
Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital 
community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future 
payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some 
very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to 
cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think 
that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if 
I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer 
enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned 
professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this 
note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too 
presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not 
wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep 
up the great work!

Jay

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=

Subject: tent


Elvis,
Woody sent me a note today.  In it he mentioned that he has the old roll
book from the fraternity house.  He said he took it because the young
fellas had no respect for the past.
This reminded me of an idea I had earlier.  I was thinking of the banner
for our tent and thinking of some way of making it clear that it was the
Old Betas tent...and beer.  I was thinking of 'Original House Betas',
'Silver/Grey Betas'(...though I've become a silver-gray, my heart keeps
time and measure... with Beta Theta Pi, to find my highest pleasure.
Samuel N Wilson, Hanover '72) or something like that to distinguish our
tent from the active Beta tent.
I'm sure there are any number of clever titles that accomplish the same
thing....keeping a bunch of young beer guzzling freeloading strangers out
of our fricking tent!
That's all.

BEEK

Edward, Jeff is booked solid today and Friday and traveling tomorrow.  He 
then will be on vacation from December 18-January 2.  I would suggest that 
you send him an e-mail.  If he needs any additional information, we can try 
to get the two of you together for a few minutes the morning of the 
interview.  SRS

Jeff,

I spoke with Mark Palmer concerning the interview with Businessweek magazine, 
January 2nd.  He has asked me to participate in the article to discuss Enron 
Media Services and thought it would be a good idea for me  to give you a 
quick update in the event the reporter questions you about the business.  Let 
me know if you would like for me to stop by or call you to bring you up to 
date.   I will be out on vacation December 20th returning January 2nd.

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO.


Edward Ondarza

March 28, 1999

This is the first day of the Kurban Bayram (Holiday of the Sacrifice)
and Istanbul's streets are full of folks in their holiday best.

And blood.

For days cows, lambs, goats, rams, and other big animals, have been
being brought to Istanbul from the countryside.  (I read that in Cairo
you could see people bringing their animals in by cab.)  Tent cites
(consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastic
tarps) full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges, in
garbage filled lots and along the highways.  The city's normal perfume
of car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of the
barnyard.

And, today, the slaughter began.

Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building,
evidence of a recent butchering.  On a muddy hillside in one of the
older neighborhoods south of the Halic (Golden Horn) in Eski (Old)
Istanbul, I saw several women, all smiling, surrounding a man vigorously
chopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax.  The cow's recently
skinned hide was spread out neatly beside them, the rest of the animal
in a heap nearby.  I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks, no
doubt full of the spoils of a recent kill, into the trunk of a car.
(Sorry, but my weak imagination couldn't help but conjure up to images
from Scorcese's "Goodfellas".)  By a mosque, three was a lone Ram's head
under a tree.  Its snout was pointing upwards, as if thinking about
stretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it.
On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man, hacking off the skin
of a decapitated lamb, rolled the body back and forth like a water
balloon.  A few meters away, a pen full of sheep ate their feed
contentedly from a trough.  I looked closely at them, was surprised to
see that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going on
right next to them.  Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street.
I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley, from which I was assaulted
by a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat.  Later,
I watched, with absolutely no idea what it meant, a young man put his
fingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car and
wipe it on the license plate.

The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems, second
only Ramadon ("Ramazon" in Turkish).  It's the time for the hajj ("hac"
in Turkish), or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which all Moslems of any means are
to make at least once in their lifetimes.  Here, in Turkey, most folks
get at least two days off work, some the entire week.  During the
holiday, throughout the Moslem world, many families buy an entire animal
for sacrifice, using only a part of it themselves, giving the bulk of it
to others, including most importantly the poor.  Some play amateur
butcher, but I have been told the vast majority of them have an "expert"
do it.  Indeed, the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick and
painless as possible.

The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim
(Abraham to non-Moslems) was ordered by God to sacrifice his son.
Abraham reluctantly agreed, but was given a last minute reprieve and was
allowed to sacrifice a ram instead.  It is a powerful story about belief
and faith (and must give animal rightists a few textual problems).  I
can see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount.  It
certainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story of
God's sacrifice of his son.

As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed.  The city was a
slaughterhouse, full of, for me, somewhat gruesome contrasts.  Young
girls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny three-piece suits ran around
the streets laughing and playing games, with blood on their shoes.  I
passed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creature's stomach,
which had been left on a pile of garbage.  I saw a little girl holding
her mother's hand, smiling at me shyly, as her mom picked through a pile
of discarded intestines.

April 5, 1999

My discontent at the sights of the Kurban, I concluded later, was a bit
sanctimonious.  Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks, it's
only that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bit
more discretely.  But why should it be?  Isn't it a better, or at least
a  lot more honest, to understand what the animal part, and animal,
you're eating looked like when it was still alive (including rippling
muscles, forlorn gaze, and all)?  I thought of my canoe trips to Canada,
and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught and
cleaned the unlucky critter myself.  A sharpening of reality, I think,
is always a good thing (especially in this time when so much of our
"knowledge" and "experience" comes secondhand through the media,
including, I have to reluctantly admit, my beloved books).  If our
rituals, often the most powerful means of creating reality-blindness,
can be infused with as much truth as possible, all the better I'd say.
(Then, perhaps, when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves with
disintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper....)

Today is the five-month anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul.
It's an amazing thing I've done for myself, I think.  I am as close to
totally engaged in my life, and the world around me, as I have ever
been.  It will be hard to live any other way again, I imagine.

In the last week and a half, three terrorists here in Turkey succeeded
only in blowing themselves up, much, I suppose, to their martyred soul's
chagrin.  I've got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK
(or whomever) being on its last legs.  There are important elections,
national and local, coming up on April 18th, so we'll probably get a
chance to see just how long those legs are.

Hope all is well.  Drop me a line.

Mark-O

=09


Eric Shaw's team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by th=
e=20
Turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the Turkish energy=
=20
sector.

On January 6, the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custod=
y.=20
In the following days, other officials from TEA? (the electricity generatio=
n=20
monopoly) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and=20
executives from a number of Turkish companies were also taken into custody.=
=20

While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released, a leaked=
=20
report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide=
=20
ranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural=20
Resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen.=20

Enron Implications

Trakya - One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enron=01,s  478 MW Trakya =
power=20
project was being investigated.  This has not been reported anywhere else. =
=20
Because the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the=
=20
past, we are not surprised by this report. Although an investigation is=20
always a possibility, other than the one newspaper report, there has been n=
o=20
indication, official or otherwise, that an investigation is planned or=20
underway.
=20
GAMA - It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim, the Gener=
al=20
Manager of BOTA? (the natural gas monopoly), works at GAMA, our Turkish=20
partner in the Trakya project, and that his expensive car was a gift from=
=20
GAMA. GAMA has told us, and Yardim has defended himself publicly by saying,=
=20
that his wife has been working at GAMA since 1993, long before Yardim had=
=20
risen to his current position of power at BOTA?, and that the car was not a=
=20
gift from GAMA. It is worth noting, however, that there have been a number =
of=20
newspaper reports questioning GAMA=01,s role in a controversial gas marketi=
ng=20
deal being undertaken by their TurRusGas joint venture with Gazprom and BOT=
A?.

Outlook

It is still not clear how or when this investigation will end. In the mediu=
m=20
and long term, this will be good news for Enron and other reputable Turkish=
=20
or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy=
=20
deals in Turkey in the past. In the short term, however, it is likely to=20
result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the Turkish energy=20
sector, as worried bureaucrats, innocent and guilty, lay low.=20

We will continue to monitor developments, especially with regard to the=20
Trakya project, and report as necessary.

Dear Mr Skilling

Following the success of our three previous annual conferences on the 
e-business and technology sector, the Economist Conferences is delighted to 
announce that we are now planning our fourth annual event Creating Value with 
Internet Technologies,  to take place in London in October of this year. We 
would very much like to invite you to deliver a keynote address at this event.

Now that spending on IT and systems is once again being evaluated in terms of 
productivity gains and returns on investment, companies are refocusing their 
efforts towards cost savings and efficiencies. As companies integrate the 
Internet into their supply chains, they frequently find that they need to 
change much more than their communications technology. Their strategy, their 
approach, their deployment of skilled people, their divisional structure - 
all these things get challenged.

We would very much like to hear your perspective on the potential for the 
e-marketplace, but, at this stage, I would also be happy to hear your 
suggestions.

The project is still in the early stages but we would like to secure our key 
speakers as early as possible. I am sure your diary will be very busy but we 
feel it would be of great value to have you there. Please find attached a 
draft outline of the event, and some further information about the Economist 
Conferences.
I do hope you will be able to consider our invitation, as your participation 
would certainly help to ensure that we offer an excellent programme and 
further add value to this annual gathering. If you have any further 
questions, please do not hesitate to contact me on one of the numbers below.  
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely

It was great catching up with you in Barcelona and wonderful to hear that
you will be coming to South Africa on vacation. When you are in J'Burg,
plan on staying with us and if you can fit it in, try to spend a couple of
days up at our game park. Our place is about 2 1/2 hours north of
Johannesburg, on about 120,000 acres, malaria free with the big 5 as well
as a great variety of other game. It would be great to sit together on the
deck of our lodge with a gin and tonic at catch up while watching elephant
in our front yard. If you are time constrained, we can always charter up to
Welgevonden if you don't have an Enron plane in the vicinity.

Here are some contact details
   Home phone - 27-11 447-8514
   Cell - 27-82-880-5954
   Fax - 27-11-321-1276
   Office- 27-11-321-1255

As soon as your plans firm up, give me a ring to see how we can get
together. We also know this part of the world quite well so we'd be
delighted to help plan your trip. Chovine and I will look forward to seeing
you.

Best regards

Schof

Jeff,

Thanks for getting back to me.  You probably saved us quite a bit of time and 
money.  

It looks like half of the City of London has been duped into helping E.ON 
fool its shareholders.  I wonder how many of their other sales were actually 
auctions versus pre-arranged sales dressed up for the shareholders.

We will start our brainstorming sessions over again with a new rule - no 
Germans!

Thanks again,

Joe

Stan felt it would be appropriate for the Policy Committee to review the 
attached changes to the Analyst / Associate PRC process, prior to execution.  
In summary, the following modifications have been developed by the heads of 
the AAPRC Committees (Horton, Kean, and Sherriff) and A/A Program Management 
(Lemmons):

? Most cross-calibration will be at the business unit level, since this is 
where the best interaction and information gathering occurs.  Steps to ensure 
consistency across the business units are outlined in the memo.  The final 
PRC meeting will focus on business unit ranking distributions, and the 
names/attributes of the top performers across the company.
? The PRC committees have been expanded to improve the quality of 
representation, and to reflect the diversity of our workforce.  The additions 
were selected from a pool of high performing VPs and Directors.  To ensure 
fairness, only VPs and Directors will provide representation on the AAPRC 
Committee.  
? An attachment has been included to clarify program tenure and promotion 
criteria.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss by 
mid-day Wednesday, May 9.  We are planning to release this information to the 
memo distribution list that evening.

Regards,
Billy

Jane

While you were gone I've been working hard in the interest of Boston
University!  As a result you will be hearing from a Mr. Jeffrey Skilling
and his daughter Kristen from Houston, Texas.

They were in town Friday for a visit. They went to the reception center
and took the tour.  They were favorably impressed. Kristen is a junior
and will probably be applying next year.

I told Mr. Skilling about you and was wondering when/if you could meet
Kristen. I don't think she will be coming back up here immediately. But
you visit schools in Houston and go to open houses there, don't you? At
the very least you could talk on the telephone.

If it is alright with you I'm giving him your email address and you
three could communicate. She will be an excellent candidate.  Her scores
are good and she plays field hockey and is a competitive swimmer.

Thanks Jane and welcome back,

Kay

Kevin,

Many thanks for agreeing to speak at our YPO session on April 24, 2001, in
Houston.  The meeting will be held at Enron Broadband Services' network
equipment staging building, which is close to downtown.  We anticipate
attendance of about 100 people.

Breakfast will begin at 7:30 a.m., and the program will run from 8:15 a.m.
to 10:15 a.m.  The subject is "New Trends in Technology and Venture
Capital."  You will be on a panel discussion with two other venture
capitalists.  I expect the tone will be highly informal, but I will
schedule a conference call (probably in early March) to provide more
details and specific topics of interest.

Again, Kevin, thank you.  I look forward to seeing you in April.

Jeff

We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "wish list" for us.  The response 
was tremendous and, in some cases, very creative.  Your fellow employees 
asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush.  In all, we received 
requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event.  We thought 
you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting, so we've 
provided a sampling of the suggestions below.  Here are the top ten most 
requested eSpeakers.

10.  Jack Welch, CEO, General Motors 
9.  Scott McNeally, CEO, Sun Microsystems 
8.  Satisfied Enron Customers
7.  Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
6.  Oprah Winfrey, talkshow host
5.  General Colin Powell, former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S.A. 
4.  Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Federal Reserve, U.S.A.
3.  Former U.S. President George Bush 
2.  Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft 
1.  Texas Governor George W. Bush

While we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least 
some of these special guests.  If you have any contacts who could help us get 
in touch with these guest speakers, please let us know at ethink@enron.com.  
Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak.

There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well.  Those requests 
should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our 
colleagues can be quite a task!

Thank you all for your participation.

Hello Phil
The eGroups shows that you are listed as a member of the smu-betas group.
So you have been successful getting in the group.
To access the group should go to your web browser and type in
http://www.egroups.com

The screen should show that you are a member of smu-betas group. When you
replied to the original invitation, egroups may have asked for a login name
or password.  I'm not sure if it automatically signs you in or asks for you
to create a password.
You can simply click on the name "smu-betas" in the MyGroup section.
Otherwise, you can sign in by clicking on the "sign-in" hyperlink listed to
the left side of the screen in the MyGroups category.  It will prompt for
your email address.  If you already have the password set up, it will fill
it in automatically.

Give this a try. I think you should make it into the egroups. Let me know if
you still have problems getting in.
It you still have problems, you can also contact me directly at
shackleton@worldnet.att.net or craig_shackleton@amat.com
There are 53 members on the list now, including yourself, so the promised
land is getting well-populated.

Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr. Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call
scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.

Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve
Friedman and other selected guests.  Our next dinner is scheduled for July
19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Regards,
Erica Harris

Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but
will return tomorrow morning.

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the
dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to
free up some time.  Thank you.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

Troy said questions are OK.  Here are three suggestions from Troy:

1. Please explain briefly the type of government (i.e. City Manager,
Mayor, Council, Fire Commissioner) or other system that you had served
with as a fire officer in the past 10 years.

2. State whether the fire department has any employee group, association
or union that is recognized as the bargaining agent for the department.
If so, please describe your working relationship with that organization.

3. Does the department where you presently work have any type of state or
local civil service?  If so, explain.

Dear Jeffrey K. Skilling:

In New York City, next Monday and Tuesday, May 14 and 15, you have an
unprecedented opportunity to discover tangible ways to maximize the value
of your company's intellectual property.  Learn how to

? Use your IP to increase stockholder value,
? Determine the value of your IP to outside markets,
? Assess your IP value against the costs to exploit it,
? Handle your IP without risk of infringement,
? Balance business priorities while preserving IP rights
? Turn today's IP challenges into tomorrow's profits.

For 75 years the American Management Association has been showing companies
how to adapt to changing business environments.  With this conference, we
do it again!  Register today and help your company find its hidden IP
wealth!  Call 1-800-262-9699 for details and to register.

Complex technological innovations coupled with a proliferation of
intellectual property rights have brought the rich potential of IP to the
forefront in corporations throughout the world.  Many have discovered
competitive advantage in their once-hidden IP assets.  This seminar
provides a practical framework for understanding the array of issues
surrounding intellectual property and how to turn that knowledge into
corporate profits.

Showing the way will be IP expert lawyers from New York's premier IP law
firm Fish & Neave.  Corporate executives, come and learn; Corporate
executives, send your in-house lawyers.  The cutting edge of intellectual
property law and strategy will be on display at this conference!

We look forward to seeing you at the IP Strategies to Enhance Corporate

Beta Thursday Night Gang,

Significant progress has been made in our quest to locate an alternate
venue for our Thursday night rendezvous.

The suggestion actually came from Queensbury, NY of all places.  Yes,
brother Rob Rossell ('77) has volunteered his brother Bill's
establishment....Lakewood Landing.  Tom Benson says it's near Stan's Blue
Note Inn.

A brief description, details and directions will follow.

I spoke to Mike Arends today...it looks like Mike will be joining us in
spite of the fact that he will be at the alter 2 weeks later.  Rob
Rossell tells me that Tim Strange is coming down with Harry Singleton.
The brothers just keep on coming out of the woodwork.  Rob Bugh got into
the loop only recently- too late to make plans to leave the flock behind.

Though he's become a silver-gray, his hand keeps time and measure...check
out Elvis doin' the hambone thing (attachment).  A Beta Top 40 included
too! (don't worry Jansson, I still have my day job)

Sanjay, Jeff asked me to write you to introduce you to Gerald Chan, the 
brother of Ronnie Chan (ENE director).  Gerald has been investing in capital 
ventures in the US and Asia for many years.  Of late, he has been running 
into companies in which Enron is investing or is interested in investing, and 
Jeff met with him today to discuss this.  Jeff suggested that Gerald contact 
you to discuss further.  I have provided Gerald with your telephone numbers, 
address and e-mail address.  You should expect to hear from him shortly.

For your information, below is the pertinent information on Gerald:

Dad and mom,

As for my Cyprus trip, I flew into Lafkosia, the Turkish controlled half of
a town that the Greeks call Nicosia (which is probably the name that shows
up on the map).  From there went to a town called Maras (Greek name Varosha)
on the east coast.  Actually stayed in the contiguous town named Gazimagusa
(Famagusta to the Greeks).  (Just the name confusion suggests some pretty
deep problems on Cyprus, doesn't it.)  Have been working on an piece about
Maras for the last few days. Think its a winner.  Maras has been a ghost
town since the Turkish "peace operation" (i.e. invasion) in 1974, its empty,
spooky beach lined by abandoned high rise hotels.  Could get only so far as
a militarized border fence.  Should be timely in light of UN sponsored
"proximity talks" between the two sides that continue in Geneva on January
31st.

After going to Girne (Kyrenia), I returned to Turkey by a hydrofoil, which
though not similar in design probably close to the size of the ferry we used
to cross from SF to Marin.  I suppose that it riding above the waves at
times made things more smooth, though it didn't seem that way.  (Not even
sure those things are to be used on rough seas.) Occasionally when we hit a
big roll the bottom of the boat would drop back down to the sea with a huge,
literally nauseating slap.  (The boat equivalent of a belly flop I suppose.)
  I think the skipper, to avoid the roughest of the seas, cut directly over
to the Turkish coast, which we then followed east to the port of Tasucu.  I
guess it was probably a wise strategy, but more than doubled the time (and
discomfort).  Still, especially now consigned to memory, a great experience.

It's snowing here too, pretty hard.  First big one for Istanbul, though the
rest of Turkey has been hit hard already.  (For example, I was wearing sun
glasses on my train ride back here, to cut down the snow glare.)  Most of
the snow now falling seems to be melting on the ground.  Besides being
beautiful (from the comfort of inside), my English lesson (I'm the teacher,
believe it or not) was cancelled, so I'm excited to get back to my writing.

Things go well.  Thanks for the note.

Love,

Mark-O

Subject:  RE: Genesis Park


Thanks for the reply Sherri.  I missed Jeff last night at Paul's so we
didn't get a chance to talk.  Paul and I would appreciate the opportunity
to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given
everyone's tight schedules, but please find below some dates that work for
Paul and me:

Dec 11 afternoon; Dec 12 afternoon; Dec 13 10:30-2:00; Dec 15 afternoon;
Dec
18/19/21 all day

Please let me know if any of these dates work so we can set a firm time.
If
Jeff wants to combine with lunch, that would be great too.  Thanks/Neil.

Dear Neil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he will be at Paul Hobby's open house
this evening and hopes to see you there to discuss Genesis Park and Vitol.
In the event you two do not cross paths there, please let me know and we'll
see what we can do to schedule a meeting before the end of the year.

Subject:  Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Good morning! I just wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you for your

Please review the attached document of pre-interview questions I have drafted 
and let me know what you think. I'd like to send this out first thing Monday 
morning to give the candidates a week to respond (interviews will take place 
on Tuesday, March 6 from 8am to 2pm.)  Following each question you will find 
my reason (in bold and italics) for asking that specific question - it has 
been included in the attached document only for your information.

We are almost there!

Thanks,
Lisa

Bros.,
Hold the phone.  Woody has submitted some more corrections to the
"Drunken Beta" song.  With the aid of a vague recollection, his revisions
appear to be quite plausible.  I'll send out the final product once we've
got I hammered out.

In anticipation of re-opening, you have an opportunity to pre-select your new 
locker location.  All active Body Shop members who had a permanent locker at 
the time of the September 1st construction close have been given first 
consideration when selecting their new locker location before December 29th.  
 Priority will be given to member's original locker location (i.e. a member 
who requests their original locker area will be given priority for that 
space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm. 



Follow these simple steps to secure your locker location:
Open and review the attached Men's Locker Design template.
Select your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice location preference.
Complete the Locker Selection Request Form.  
Complete and Sign the Locker Payroll Deduction Form.
Return all completed forms before December 29th to the Body Shop at EB1355, 
drop off at our offices on EB1372 or at the Body Shop Table in the lobby from 
December 18th through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm.

You will receive an e-mail notifying you of your new locker location and 
locker combination prior to re-opening.  If you have any questions, please 
contact the Body Shop Front Desk at  x35547.
