To summarize the outcome of the meeting this morning....
In the short term:
Storage allocations will continue to be the final process performed during the Timely and Evening cycles
Storage allocations will be before the Confirmation process for the Non-Grid, IntraDay1 and IntraDay 2 cycles / SBS will not be available during the Confirmation process for these cycles 
The changes will be made effective for the gad day of July 6th

For the longer term
Continue the above 
Make modifications to the storage allocatons program to allow SBS availability for storage activity which is the opposite to the activity being allocated (i.e., SBS storage withdrawals when storage injections are being allocated)

Lynn, I have resolved Tony Gee and Matt Martindale questions concerning this weekend storage allocation for the gas day June 23.

Matt was concern that Tenaska's Mid-17 contract 106171 was cut by our storage allocation the first time on Intraday 2.  In fact this contract received a small cut on the Non-Grid AM cycle.  Matt changed his nomination in the evening cycle to change some of his supply from Northern Border's Ventura to Mid-17 storage.  This nomination change will now be code as "incremental" on his storage contract 21229 for the remaining cycles.  Tenaska was able to avoid storage allocation cut on their IDD contract 21229 until Intraday 2 due to a "PRR" code for supply cut by Northern Border at Ventura.  Our storage allocation  only cut Tenaska Mid-17 path for gas delivered to their contract 21344 due to storage cuts downstream.  I have advised Matt  to be aware of these problems when changes nomination.

Tony Gee thought he was being "bump" or cut in the Intraday 2 cycle on his IT contract 5915 and FDD  contract 102835 on his supply from Northern Border's Ventura.  Prior to Intraday 2 we donot true-up storage allocation cuts until Intraday 2 with Northern Border.  Tony was only checking his nomination with Northern Border on his contract 5915 and seeing all his volume schedule to flow.  Tony failed to check his schedule volumes in Hot-Tap after the evening cycle to see his actual schedule volume was cut due to storage allocation.   Advised Tony to check his schedule volume in Hot-Tap after each cycle.

Subject:	SBA Priority during Allocations

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get "squeezed" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a "point", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as "SBA IT"?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

Subject:	Allocation Review

Gerry, 
I had some discussions yesterday with Sue Neville and Larry Swett regarding storage allocations. They have a concern that our current procedure may not provide the minimum level of scheduled activity needed to support the physical storage requirements at certain times during the year.  In the month of July, Larry needs to maintain gas flow into Redfield and Lyons. A minimum quantity of 200,000 MMBtu (150,000 @ Redfield and 50,000 @ Lyons) per day is needed to avoid operational problems in the fields. Normally, the daily maximum withdrawal capacity at Cunningham (200,000) is more than enough to handle the contingency. However, there have been times where the net storage activity is less than minimum flow needed to meet minimum injection levels at Redfield and Lyons. 

For example, the receipt storage capacity is currently set at 600,000 and delivery capacity at 200,000. This means allocations are only triggered when the net storage activity is greater than a receipt (injection) of 600,000 or delivery (withdrawal) of 200,000. any net storage activity falling between that range continues uninterrupted  It follows then that if the net storage activity is zero (300,000 inj / 300,000 wd) no allocation is needed and if all things were equal, all NNG storage would be shut-in because all the gas destined for storage would be diverted to meet the withdrawal needs of others.

What Sue and Larry suggest is that floor (minimum injections in Summer and minimum withdrawals in the Winter) be factored into the allocation process to provide the minimum activity needed. For example, if we choose to set a floor (minimum) of 100,000 net injections and net storage activity is zero (300,000 inj / 300,000 wd), then storage allocation would be triggered because net storage injections were less than 100,000 MMBtu for that day. This floor would require that 100,000 of the withdrawals be allocated off to achieve a net storage injection floor of 100,000 MMBtu. 

Do you think that this floor concept is do-able? If so, how much time would program changes take to complete?
Lets get together next week to discuss further.

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

	Mike, thanks for the update.  I have a couple of questions/comments:

	1.  Is Legal and Regulatory in the loop on these decisions?

	2.  Anything we can automate, I would like to ensure we have the automation on the enhancement

How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a "point", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as "SBA IT"?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?
