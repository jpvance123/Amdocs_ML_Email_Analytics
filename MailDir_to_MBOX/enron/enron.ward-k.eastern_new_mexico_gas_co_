Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.  
      Dan

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company 
to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into 
the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for 
approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard 
you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim:

Here is another one.  We have a deal with this muni - Eastern New Mexico Gas 
Company.  The price is Permian plus $05/MMBtu plus transport.  Deliveries are 
on TW.  The deal is expiring 4/30/01.  John Mattics is the contact 
(505/355-2468).  He called me yesterday to see if we were interested in 
extending the deal.  The desk likes the deal as it gives them some 
flexibility on TW (I am not sure exactly what the value is there, but I think 
Janie likes the deal).  Can you check with Tori or Janie and see if they want 
to extend the deal?  Is the price OK?  Also, what is your fax number....I 
will fax you the contract.

Chris
