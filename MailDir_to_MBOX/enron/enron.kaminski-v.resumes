I gave a talk to a bunch of UH MBA students taking a course on options.  One 
of the more interesting of the inevitable stream of resumes is the enclosed. 
Perhaps an EBS hire?

Dr. Masson,

I attended your lecture at UH and enjoyed it tremendously.  If possible, I
would like to investigate a career opportunity with your group in particular
or Enron in general.  Would you please review my resume and/or forward to
potentially interested parties?

In tandem will all of Enron's other propaganda efforts, your top-notch
lecture at UH spurred me to do some soul searching.  I currently work at
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, but have been extremely impressed with
Enron's cutting-edge research and market-leading position.

I have a Ph.D in electrical engineering from Rice (statistical signal
processing) with two years of experience at Duke relating to the valuation,
risk management, and risk measurement of financial derivatives and physical
assets.  I seek a similar position that would allow me to leverage my
quantitative skills and grow within in the corporation.

I believe I would be a great fit with Enron and hope you would consider me
for a potential position.

Best regards,
Matt Crouse

Vincent,

I have forwarded the resume to our Analysts / Associate pool with
a recommendation to accept David as a summer intern.

I expressed interest in taking him into my group. He may, of course,
work for a different unit of Enron. It's up to him and I shall not be offended
if he would like to go into trading or deal origination.

Dear Vince:

It was so nice meeting and talking with you too. I did
not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in
Enron.

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I
have been working two years as Lead Scientist and
Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue
Management Inc. in Houston.

I developed and implemented the mathematical models
for Trading Optimization System and Firm
Transportation Optimization System.

The Trading Optimization System becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the
contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years.

Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management. I am
confident that I can make significant contributions to
Enron in this area.

I would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
Enron.

Sincerely Yours


Jacob

Dr. Kaminski,

I appreciate you for giving me a good
opportunity to have the interview.
The visit to ENRON was very impressive.
Thanks for arranging interviews with people
at research department and extra interview
at the ENRON net work.
It was good to have chance to meet such nice people,

It was a good experience for me and
I hope we have chance to see each other.

Shirley,

I just spoke with Vince and asked him if he would be available to interview 
one last candidate on Monday.  He said no problem that both he and Stinson 
would be available for interviews.  Could you please put on Vince's schedule 
one interview at 8:45am-9:15am.  Stinson's interview will be from 
9:30am-10:00am.

I will just bring the candidate to their offices so they do not have to show 
up early.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at extension 53214.

Thank you very much,

Kristin Gandy

Please, take a look at this resume. Any interest?
I got it from a headhunter (I don't know her,

Hi there Mr. Kaminski! It was a pleasure to speak with you today. I look

forward to lunch one day soon at Brennans.

Wayne Tow is a brilliant man, He worked for many years for a man I know
well.  This man says, Wayne is as good as it get, and he could do
anything that is assigned to him, and do it at  a level in which he was
always amazed.
He loves the E-commerce area, and this is what he wants to do
Thank you, Vince.

Dear Shirley,

Thank you so much for your email.  After carefully considering my career
goals, I feel the associate program with a rotation in the Enron
Research Group is a better fit.  I am really interested in Enron and I
would try to contact your colleagues in the Associate Program about this
issue before I schedule an interview with the Enron Research Group.  I
truly apologize for the inconvenience caused and I want to thank you
again for your kind assistance.

 Good morning Kin:

 Your resume was forwarded to the Research Group with Enron North
 America and they would like you to come in for an informal
interview
 sometime next week.  The following dates and times are available
within
 our group.  Please let us know if either of these two dates fit
your
 schedule.

 Monday, November 6th:
 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM

 Friday, November 10th:
 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM

 Since we prefer these interviews to begin at 8:00 AM, it would
probably
 be best if you came the night before, spent the night at a hotel
downtown
 and then were able to be at the Enron Bldg by 8:00 AM.  Please
let me
 know if this is what you would like to do and we will make the
hotel
 reservation.

 I look forward to hearing from you.

 Best regards,

 Shirley Crenshaw

Vince and Ravi,

Attached below is the resume of a student graduating from the University of 
Chicago with an MS in Mathematics.  His specialty is financial mathematics 
and his coursework seems to have covered a lot of the sorts of things that I 
understand your group to do, Vince.  He is extremely interested in Enron and 
contacted me because I am an alum of the College at the U of C.  I gather he 
didn't go through Enron's typical recruiting process for Analysts or 
Associates because his background is more technical, than commercial.  He 
acknowledged that his business experience is limited and from his resume you 
can tell that he is young.  He would therefore be willing to start as an 
Analyst or whatever the equivalent would be for a non-rotating position, but 
his interest is in doing the kind of work that you do, Vince, and Ravi, I 
know you have a similar background.  

Please let me know if this candidate would be of interest to either of you.  
If so, feel free to contact him directly.  He would like to start work this 
summer after graduating in June.

Thanks for your time and I hope this is useful to you.

Regards,
Laura

Dear Vince,

How are you? Well I hope.

I hope you don=01,t mind me writing to you. You may remember that 5 months =
ago
I left Risk Publications and moved to a charity. Having been here for only =
a
few months, I have decided that this job is not for me (I miss the buzz of =
a
corporate office) and I have decided to move back into the corporate sector=
.

Because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector, I am
very interested in moving into this area. I have always thought that it
would be great to work for Enron because it is such a dynamic company and I
am planning to approach the London office to discuss any opportunities,
which might be available. I am particularly interested in product marketing
and research, although I am very open-minded at the moment. I wondered
whether you could recommend the right person to speak to in London.

I know that you are incredibly busy, but any help you can give me would be
fantastic Vince.

Thanks and best regards,


Vicky Windsor

Dear Lance,

Thank you very much for all of your help through this process.

At present, I am really tied up with Mock Market activities in Austin
Energy. It would be inappropriate for me to leave at this time since the
whole project will be jeopardized. Therefore, I decided not coming to
Houston for an interview.  I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this
may cause you.

I do appreciate what you did and hope we can keep in touch in the future.

Thank you again for your help and wish you best.

Jinbaek in the 11:00 am time slot, if you don't have anyone else scheduled 
then.  If not, I can easily meet with hiim after lunch.

Hi, Dr. Kaminski:

   I am Zhendong, the student of Dr. Deng. I think Dr. Deng has sent my
resume to you. I am very happy to have an opportunity to work with you
this summer.
   I am a student in both MS qcf and Ph.d EDA programs in Georgia Tech
now. I plan to find a job in industry instead of academic after my
graduation. So I intend to do internship during the process of prusuing my
degree to acquire some experience for my future career.
   I hope to start on 5/14/2001 and end on 8/17/2001.
   Thanks a lot.

Grant and Vince,

Thanks for arranging my visit to Enron.  I was impressed by the nature and
scope of work in the group and the people I met.  I look forward to hearing
from you later in the week.

A few peple asked me the method I used to value Asian options.  It is an
approximate method based on geometrical averaging with an adjusted exercise
price, as described by Gordon Gemmill in Option Pricing: An International
Perspective, McGraw-Hill, London, 1993, pages 242-248.

Regards,

Greg

Got a little scared at your first sentence I read "He is no replacement for 
Jay but he could be for Dennis B .."??.

Anyway:

I think he would be a good fit withing the group.  Krisna has offered to hire 
him in the research group, he has good programing background and is excited 
about working for Enron instead of a Utility such as PacificCorp.  He 
expressed interest in applying his skill to make $$$$. 

I suggest bringing him in in research as a first alternative.  I see three 
potential applications where we can use his skills to evaluate best longer 
term fit:
Continuing Ronnie's model building role, but with a focus within Neil's group 
to tie RM systems together
Bridge the lack of Phd Econometrics expertise we have as are result of the 
departure of Anoush.
Risk Management Systems Infrastructure development.

To: James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES

Subject: Ming Sit

He is no replacement for Jay but he could be a Dennis B employee.

Pros:
Engineer so would be good at math
His boss hired him a 2nd time (1at TXU and again at Pacificor again) so he 
must be reliable
Phd in Economics and Engineering (good) from Stanford (ugh :) :) :) )

Cons:
Does not understand Tariffs.  I asked him and he said he is not experienced.  
I probed too and he does not understand regulatory that well.
Does not understand Ancillary Services (which is surprising to me since he 
started out as an plant operation side of HK Power)
Has limited people management skills (he described 1 analyst he works with 
that is not capable that he has to jump into the excel spreadsheet and fix it 
for him and he cannot give him feedback because it is a utility mentality)
He is not a good communicator (I asked him to describe what he did in HK 
Power and it took him forever to explain because he expected me to know that 
plant operations meant planning the start up of oil plants).

Overall:  
I suspect that he is a very solid guy when it comes to analysis but not 
particularly creative or good at communication and leadership.  He would be a 
great support person.
I would hire for analysis but not as a potential leader.Go

Dr. Kaminski,

Thank you very much.
Of course, I'll be happy to have an opportunity
to work at such a wonderful company.
I was contacting with Surech Raghavan at Deal Bench team,
and was going to express my appreciation to you again
after settling down process with them.

For the period of working,
I still need to coordinate with my advisor and
may need to adjust according to that.
but anyway, I'll try to coordinate smoothly.

Please let me know whether I should keep contacting
with Deal Bench team,
for working period and
for misc. living support such as finding a place, rent a car, etc.

I appreciate you so much again,
for arranging such meetings and giving me an opportunity.
All this opportunity will not be available to me,
without your kind help.

Warm Regards,
Jinbaek

Vince -

I work in the Caribbean Structuring Group and previously worked at Entergy 
Power Marketing on the Structuring desk with Gary Zhu.  I am attaching the 
resume of a friend from Entergy who holds a PhD in Operations Research.  He 
is considering a move from Entergy and from speaking with Li Xiao I thought 
that your group might be a good fit for him.  Please call with any questions

Molly,

We can pay for the plane ticket.
We have to make sure that we shall extend the same
treatment to other summer interns to avoid
bad feelings.

We received some correspondence this morning from Jinbaek in which he says he plans to start on June 4, 2001.   Since we are trying to offer a package comparable to that of an Associate in the Program, I assume we will also pay for his plane ticket here???    Just wanted to check before I contacted him...., so I'll wait to hear from you.

Thanks,
Molly

Shirley, 

We interviewed by phone Karthik and would now like to bring him for a visit 
to Enron.    Can you either arrange it or forward to HR for them to arrange, 
whichever is best.   While here Karthik should probably talk with

Zimin, Paulo, Bob, Vasant, Krishna, Vince
and anyone else Vince wants to add to the list.

thanks,

Stinson

His resume is attached below.   His phone # is  765 494 2181.

Shane,

Thanks for your message.  As a matter of fact, I expected your resume in time
for our summer internship program.

We shall be glad to invite you for an interview. How long "sabbatical" do you 
envisage?

Vince

P.S. Shirley,   please, call Shane to arrange an interview with HR.

Dr. Kaminski:
?
You probably won't remember my name, but I am the Ph.D.  student that took 
you back to the airport after your visit to Louisiana State  University 
during the previous academic year.
?
I received my M.S. in Finance in May of last year, and chose  to?remain at 
LSU to work on my Ph.D. At that time, I intended to pursue a  career 
in?teaching and research at a four year college or university.?  In 
part?because of your visit,?and my?primary interest in  normative research, 
my?plans have changed.? While I?still want to  earn my Ph.D.,?I plan to 
pursue a career in research in the private  sector.
?
As you know, Ph.D. programs in financial economics are  designed to train 
future academics.? Not surprisingly, they emphasize  methods to approach the 
types of questions that are of interest to finance  academics.? What did 
surprise me, however, was that these areas of interest  often had little to 
do with what I imagined to be the concerns of practitioners  in the real 
world.? As you mentioned in your discussion, academic  researchers know 
little about what their counterparts in the private sector  
are?doing.?????????????????????????????????????  
?
In light of my objective, I feel I would get the most out of  the remainder 
of my doctoral studies if I took some time off to work in the  private sector 
to see first hand the?types of challenges I can expect to  face as a 
researcher in corporate America.? As my primary interests revolve  around the 
use of derivatives and financial engineering in corporate risk  management, 
Enron, as the leading innovator in these areas, would be an ideal  place to 
learn.? I was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the  company 
that might provide me with the exposure I am looking for.? If there  are no 
such positions or opportunities, any advice or suggestions you could give  
me,?such as whether or not you think such a "sabbatical" (for lack of a  
better term) would be helpful, or information on private sector careers for  
Ph.D.'s would be greatly appreciated.? 
?
I am sending a current copy of my vita as an attachment.?  If you have any 
questions my e-mail address is sgreen@finance.lsu.edu.? Thanks  for your help 
and advice.
?
?
Cordially,

appears that February 2nd would suit his schedule best for the visit.  How 
does that date look for Vince and the others in the group who will be

Hi Molly:

Punit Rawal is a Carnegie Mellon student that Kevin Kindall and Bob Lee
interviewed back in December.  We would like to bring him in for an
interview.  He is definately a "Trading support" prospect.  

I forwarded his resume to John Lavorato back in December and inquired
as to whether he would be interested in interviewing him or not, but have
had no response, except that he has not had a chance to look at his
resume yet.

Vince originally said that either John or Gary Hickerson might be interested.
I did not send his resume to Gary, maybe you can check with him?

I am attaching the Interview request form and his resume.  Thanks!

Shirley

him for a formal interview.

He is a hands on person with wide range of experience ( energy financing,

He communicates very well and expressed interest in financial engineering & 
modeling.

Subject: Charlie Weldon

Charlie Weldon is a candidate who was a summer associate last year.   I have 
made the one and only exception for him on the starting date.  He works with 
Mike Roberts and they had prearranged for him to work on a special project 
during hurricane season.  Unfortunately, the project can't be delayed due to 
the timing of hurricane season.  He will start in June to work on this 
project.  It is not a project that a summer associate could work on so it is 
not taking a job from one of them.

Mike totally understands the rationale for the starting date, etc. and has 
promised in blood that Charlie will start the orientation with his class and 
will not be pulled out to work on any projects during the 4 week 
orientation.  He is also someone that they would take into their group after 
orientation.  

Mike is drafting a letter that he will sign in blood indicating his promise 
re orientation.  Please keep an eye out for this individual when we send out 
the material regarding starting dates, etc.

We need to also make sure Charlie understands that he must attend the entire 
orientation.

Mike also promises to sing our praises about how great we are (smile-this is 
my addition Mike did not say that, but I am sure he will do it)

Thanks

Johnny,

Greg Spaniolo seems to be better suited for work in liquid markets--certainly 
not the situation with coal and emissions. Brad Romiane suggested that Vince 
Kaminski might be interested in this resume.

As far as my search goes, keep an eye out for the BS and MS-level folks.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you very much for meeting with me again today over lunch. I appreciated 
the opportunity to catch up with you.

Please find attached my current resume (both a short and a long version). I 
have worked as a trader, portfolio risk manager, and a stock analyst. I have 
traded derivatives, bonds, and stocks,  and managed insurance and pension 
investment portfolios to maximize risk-adjusted returns.  Let me highlight 
some of my work experiences.

Trading and Risk Management
    a.. Structured, negotiated, and traded OTC interests rate swaps, 
cross-currency swaps, swaptions, and exchange-traded equity index futures and 
options. Made PowerPoint presentations to GARP and the UOH on credit 
derivatives.
    b.. Developed investment hedging program utilizing exchanged-traded bond 
futures and interest rate swaps.
    c.. Traded and managed pension and insurance fixed income portfolios to 
maximize total return and funding ratios. Bonds traded: Treasuries, Agencies, 
MBS/CMOs, ABS, Corporate, Yankees, and Foreign.
    d.. Traded and managed stock mutual portfolios for total return.
    e.. Created a computer program to quantify the attribution of total 
return for fixed income portfolios relative to market returns.
    f.. Programmed investment compliance rules to monitor the management of 
domestic and global stock, bond and money market mutual funds.
    g.. Supervised market risks, credit risks, legal risks, and operations 
risks of derivatives, bonds, money market securities, and equities.
Policy , Reporting and Projects
    a.. Developed investment policy guidelines to manage fixed income 
portfolios.
    b.. Rewrote derivatives policy manual.
    c.. Prepared a 20-page PowerPoint slide presentation on India for the 
senior management.
    d.. Prepared and presented investment reports to CIOs, Investment 
Committees, and Boards of Trustees
I shall, therefore, appreciate your help in connecting me with the right 
individual within Enron for a job interview to work as a financial 
trader/risk manager. I can provide excellent references upon request.

Thank you for the lunch.

        Dear Mr. Kaminski:

        How are you doing? I want to find out if we can meet again for a quick
    lunch.

        You might know that in Maharashtra, India there is now a new Chief 
Minister
        (CEO of the State Government). I am proud to say that he and I are 
from the
    same
        town, Latur.

        I would really enjoy talking with you again, at your convenience.

        I will call you tomorrow to follow up.

        Thank you.

        Sincerely,

        Maruti More

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

Sean,

I think we should  invite Bruce for additional interviews. I think that he 
does not have 
the skills required in my unit, but he could contribute in other areas.

Here is the list of potential interviewees:

John Echols
Ted Murphy
Mark Ruane

John,

This is a resume I received today from  my friend.
Please, take a look at it. What follows below is a copy of his message to
me:


Dear Vincent,

I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new
challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such
opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.

I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to
look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of
working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest
rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John
Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options
desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership
with Albert Friedberg.

 I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel
Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.

I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and
research in the field of energy markets.

With my very best regards and personal wishes,

Hi Molly!

Has this been scheduled yet?  The recruiter is asking for a copy of the
itinerary for his client and directions to the Enron bldg.  I thought I would
send both at the same time.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Vince,
James Valverde is confirmed for a Face-to-Face interview with you on Thursday 
February 1st at 1.00 PM to 5.00 PM.? When you have an interview itinerary, 
please share it with me so James know who he is interviewing with.? Please 
also tell me where you want him to show up, what floor, suite etc.? I am 
assuming you are in the building on 1400 Smith St., right?

We have not discussed yet the details regarding what key skills and 
qualifications you are looking for in a candidate, other than that they are 
bright and talented. Could you please share, via email or over the phone, 
what you are looking for in candidate for your organization.? If you want me 
to put a search together, I can only do it by knowing what you want.? Thank 
you.

If there is anything else I can do for you before the interview on Thursday, 
please let me know.

Respectfully,

Johan

    Dear Vince:
 
    I have put together a list of  finance working papers (some of which I brought to the interview last wednesday)  which I have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also (at least  initially) as a learning tool. Several of them, however, do contain  innovations.
    
    I have asked Ms. De Claris to  forward a copy to you.
 
    As I expressed to you earlier I  am particularly interested in Enron Credit Swaps trading platform and the  business opportunities that it will spawn.
 
    I also think that there are  tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the  US. I do not know if Enron has considered or is active in this market. This  would be an area that I am also very interested and in which I think much better  can be done than most of the players in the street.
 
    The question in my mind  (hopefully not prematurely) is: If there is interest here would Enron  consider letting me put together this business?
 
    I look forward to hearing from  you soon.
 
    Best regards
 
    Joao

Good afternoon Mr. Ball:

The Enron Corp. Research Group would like to conduct an informal interview 
with you at your convenience.  Please give me some dates and times within
the next 2 weeks that you might be available and I will arrange the schedule.

The people that will be interviewing you are:

Vince Kaminski   Managing Director
Stinson Gibner   Vice President
Grant Masson   Vice President
Vasant Shanbhogue  Vice President
Krishna Krishnarao  Director
Zimin Lu   Director
Tanya Tamarchenko  Manager
Alex Huang   Manager

Each individual interview will last approximately 15 - 20 minutes, so we 
probably
should allow at least  3 hours.

If you would prefer to call me with some dates and times - I can check 
the calendars while we are talking.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you.

Thanks Dr.Kaminski,
I forgot that :-)
I'll understand it as
I may identify work that I think will be
beneficial to both of us.
Actually,
I have more ideas on the work, beyond the suggestion.
I'll work on it and send it in more formal way again.
(I mean, work list, schedule, deliverables etc)

I'll take steps to get work permit for those two months.
And please tell me know what you can support
and what I should start to do to find a place to stay,
rent a car etc.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

ps. and thanks for forwarding the message.

Hi again,

I am visiting several family members and friends over the next few days.
Therefore it will be hard to contact me.

However, next week I will be easier to reach.  My contact details in NYC are
as follows. I will be staying at the following hotels:

Washington Square Hotel
from November 28th for 3 nights (Tue, Wed and Thur)
212.777.9515

Marriott NYC Financial
December 1st for 1 night (Fri)
212.385.4900


At any rate, I will still try to reach you on tomorrow morning.  If all
fails, we will try to reach each other next week.

Happy Thanksgiving,
Iris

Molly,

We can pay for the plane ticket.
We have to make sure that we shall extend the same
treatment to other summer interns to avoid
bad feelings.

We received some correspondence this morning from Jinbaek in which he says he 
plans to start on June 4, 2001.   Since we are trying to offer a package 
comparable to that of an Associate in the Program, I assume we will also pay 
for his plane ticket here???    Just wanted to check before I contacted 
him...., so I'll wait to hear from you.

Thanks,

Dear Vince:

How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After
having been working for Williams for about two years,
now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a
great company, I am wondering whether there is any
opportunity for me, either in research group or in
structure group

Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
and in charge of the quantitative research group with
7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
research and modeling about electricity,
load-following deal and tolling deals.

If you need any additional information, please feel
free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
hearing from you soon, thank you.

sincerely,
Charles

Dr. Kaminski:
?
I had intended to contact you regarding a position at Enron  this summer, but 
the department really needed me to teach a section of  undergraduate 
corporate finance this summer.? If all goes well,  and?there is a place for 
me at Enron, I would be able to start after the  summer session ends in 
late?July.? 
?
I?discussed the possibility of a sabbatical at Enron with  Drs. Tom Arnold 
and Alex Butler, both of whom send their regards, and they both  felt the 
experience would be invaluable given my research and career  objectives.? Dr. 
Arnold and I agreed that a sabbatical of 1-2 years would  be optimal.? I feel 
that it would be difficult to get a good idea of where  the company is 
headed, and to show how I can be a valuable team member in  helping it get 
there?in much less than a year.? He was afraid that the  university would 
begin to grumble if I was gone for much more than 2  years.? Any suggestions?
?
Thank you again for your help, and I look forward to hearing  from you.

Vince:

I enjoyed meeting you last week to discuss my application to join your group. 
Please keep my inquiry confidential for now.

If selected, I think your group would greatly benefit from my diverse 
skill-set including modeling skills utilizing Excel, Access, and
Bloomberg as well as graphing, statistical, and other quantitative abilities, 
especially in the meteorology field.

I am particularly interested in being able to discover vital information 
which may affect the markets (e.g. pulp/paper, interest rates, weather) as 
well as arriving at a new variable which captures all market variables into 
one which may be followed and forecasted for each of the groups.

Furthermore, I am truly committed to adding value to your group, including 
making significant contributions,
and am sanguine about my ability to ensure that these achievements are 
well-received.

I have met many people at Enron thus far and am able to utilize these 
strategic alliances by knowing who may be able
to assist your group in the quest for information on different projects. By 
accessing information quickly, both internal and 
external to the firm, the group would be able to extraordinarily benefit from 
this diligence  In addition, by seeking greater efficiencies in my work, 
I have been able to be instrumental in accumulating additional 
responsibilities. 

Most importantly, I have the mathematical acumen and insight to ensure the 
continued growth and prosperity of your group.

As a research-oriented individual, I am clearly interested in pursuing a 
position in your  group.
If selected, I would be able to bring my diverse experience, including 
financial modeling and derivatives, from my tenure at
Enron and CIBC World Markets.

I look forward to meeting with select members of your group.

Thanks,
David

Dr. Kaminski,

Thanks for your answer.
Before I tell you the time frame,
I'll need to talk with my advisor, first.
Because here is an on-going-project.
I need to coordinate the schedule.

I'll appreciate it if you understand my situation,
and give me some time (less than a week, of course).

For your reference,
probably
the dates I'd like to ask you will be
from mid-May to mid-July (2 months)

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

that an economist was coming into your group, so I don't know if you are 
interested or not.    Let me know if I can be of any help.

Dear Vince,

I am so grateful for your efforts.  I really appreciate you taking time from your busy schedule.  If you have not contacted Michael Maddox, it's even better.  I have updated and re-worded my resume to better reflect my accomplishments.  Would you please contact Michael Maddox of CERA and forward my resume to him?  His contact information is (617) 497 6446 or email: mmaddox@cera.com

Have you had a chance to talk to David Port?  Maybe there are other options.  I am flexible and willing to do whatever it takes.

Find below resume and email from someone who has built an electric generation 
commitment optimization model and is job-hunting.

His skills look pretty good.
Should we bring him for an interview?

Dear Dr. Takriti,

My name is Jorge Valenzuela. We met last year in the workshop, "The new
generation of unit commitment models".  After your presentation, we had a
brief conversation.   I  defended my Ph.D. dissertation in Industrial
Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh last December. Currently, I am
teaching at the Business School of the University of Pittsburgh, but my
interest is to work for an electric power company such as Enron.

During the last three years, my work has revolved around modeling of
electric power systems. My Ph.D. dissertation deals with the scheduling of
generating units under the new operating environment. I have proposed a
formulation that includes the option of trading at market-clearing prices
with a power pool. I model the market-clearing price by a stochastic
process based on the stochastic processes of the generating unit
availabilities and the aggregate load. I use probabilistic dynamic
programming to obtain the schedule that maximizes the expected profit.

In my resume, herewith attached, I have listed some other work that I have
done in modeling electric power systems. I would like to add that I am a
very versatile person with strong background in Operations Research,
Statistics, and Information Technology.

Please call or e-mail me if you think that your company could make use of
a person as me.  Thank you very much for your kind consideration.

Best regards,

Jorge Valenzuela

have been doing small projects that, while necessary, do not require my 
education, knowledge or research capabilities. 

I appreciate your suggestion that I speak to Vince since I am anxious to 
return to contributing at a higher level.  I am attaching my resume in the 
hope that it will trigger ideas for possible ways that I can use my abilities 
in the Research Department.  I have worked as an information specialist for 
14 years, doing research for people at all levels in both the pharmaceutical  
and energy industries.  I have focused most heavily on business research, but 
learn quickly and can branch out in whatever direction necessary for a 
project.

I'm looking forward to meeting with Vince on Monday afternoon.  Thanks again 
for your help.

Vince,

Following your eSpeak session, Erin Rice suggested I contact you about 
joining your group.  I have been with EES for almost three years, and during 
that time I have worked on tasks that are similar to what your group does on 
a larger scale.  Specifically, I excel at analytical/quantitative problem 
solving and the development of models and user requirements for application 
development.  My educational background is energy management, and I have 
recently become involved in the financial aspects of transactions.  I have 
attached my resume for your review, and I hope you will call me so we can 
talk in person.

Thank you.

Jinbaek,

May 30 sounds good. I shall inform our HR department.

I don't see any project I could get going with your advisor on such a short
notice.

When you come here you can determine in what area he could make
the biggest contribution to Enron. I shall call or E-mail
him independently and talk to him.

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in 
becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab 
experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back 
to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the 
attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel 
I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the 
qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

Vince:  Update on Charles Shen: He called me this morning to verify that we 
had received his faxed paystub.   I told him that we had, and that I had 
relayed the information to you, but hadn't heard back from you yet.   He is 
definitely interested in working for Enron, and ended up saying that he 
didn't mean to be demanding and really only wanted a package a little better 
than the one he has at Williams.

I told him that I would follow up with you to see where you wanted to go from 
here, and that I would get back to him as soon as I received some 
instructions from you.

Please let me know if you would like me to do anything else or find out any 
more information from him.

Hi Stinson, I am Juan-Carlos Ferrer, also Ph.D. student working with Gabriel 
Bitran and going to Houston with Amit and Paulo on the 16th. Paulo told me 
that you are interested in some information of us before going to Houston.

Well, I am form Chile, married, and father of two girls (3 and 2). I 
graduated from the Engineering School at the Catholic University of Chile in 
1995 having followed the track in Computer Science during the last 3 years of 
school. Then, late in 1995, I was hired by the Industrial Engineering 
department as a full-time Assistant Professor of Management Science, where I 
was teaching and doing research until June 1997. In August 1997 I came to 
Boston to join the Operations Management group in the Sloan School of 
Management here at MIT. I already finished courses and qualifiers 
requirements of my program, so now I am trying to come up with an interesting 
research topic to develop my Ph.D. thesis.

I have been dealing with some interesting topics during the last months but 
since Enron appears as an opportunity to find a more challenging and 
appealing problem to me I decided to explore it. My intention in going to 
visit Enron is to have a better understanding of the bandwidth business in 
order to define a problem to work with. I would really like to do a thesis 
that involves Internet issues and yield management models, in the line of 
Amit's work.

Any other information or question you need, please feel free to contact me.

Looking forward to meeting you on the 16th.

Juan Carlos Ferrer

Hi again,

Thank you for your email.  Sorry for the phone tag and email tag.  I will
try to call you again next week.

In the mean time, I thought I would send you a couple of documents to give
you an idea of some of the work that I have done that may be of interest to
Enron.

1.  The first word document  is my London Busines School Executive MBA
thesis relating to weather derivatives.

2.  The second word document describes a hybrid derivatives structure I I
workded on at BNP Paribas.  It has applications to the enerygy industry.

Because these documents are very large I will forward them in two separate
emails.  Your comments on them would be appreciated.

Happy Thanksgiving,
Iris

Dear Dr. Kaminski

I would like to thank for the interview opportunity at Enron. It was very nice
and pleasant to talk with very talented people.
I wish this interview develop to the further stage of the opportunity.

As matter of fact, I have started the current job at Kansas City with an
internship expiring November 3rd. I got an permanent job offer from them and I
think I should decide whether to accept the offer or not very soon.  But after
I visited Enron, I feel that I want to pursue my career development at Enron
for many reasons.
So if the decision process is made soon, I will appreciate it greatly. ( I
apologize for the hurry. I already sent a message regarding my situation to
Molly a minute ago.)

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo

Subject: asking for advice regarding Summer Associate position at Enron


Dear Mr. Zadorozhny:

Maxim Philippov suggested that I write you. Being a first-year MBA student
at Owen Graduate School of Management (Vanderbilt University) with a Finance
concentration, I am looking for a Summer Associate position at Enron.

The area of my particular interest is Enron's risk management products
(commodity derivatives research and trading). Graduating from Novosibirsk
State University with major in physics, I am eager to apply my experience
with the use of theoretical and statistical physics techniques to the
managing of modeling processes and creating complex financial and trading
models. I strongly believe that my graduate education coupled with
undergraduate background in physics, solid work experience in finance and
proven entrepreneurial spirit will allow me to contribute to Enron as a
Summer Associate.

I would really appreciate your advice regarding employment opportunities at
Enron and would like to find out more about Enron Capital & Trade Resources
Corp. I will call you within this week to follow up on my request.

Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,

Dmitri Villevald

Enclosure: resume

 <<Resume.doc>>
P.S. Looking through an example of margin risk hedging at Enron's Web site,
I think I found a small mistake there. URL of this page is

<http://www.ect.enron.com/products/risk/margin_intro.fset.html> (producer
application)

The second sentence of the paragraph beginning with "Paradigm and Enron
exchange..."
states the following.

For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then
Paradigm will pay Enron $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is
$2.00/MMBtu, then Enron will pay Paradigm $0.62/MMBtu.

I believe, if I am reading it correctly, the money should flow in the
opposite direction, namely:

For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then
Enron will pay Paradigm $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is
$2.00/MMBtu, then Paradigm will pay Enron $0.62/MMBtu.

Am I right?

Again, thank you very much for your time.

The enclosed is from another of the people in the audience of my Kao

research he does would be free.  He's looking for direction.  I doubt we 
would want to waste our time and effort on him, but I thought I should send 
this to you on the off chance that you might have a need for such a guy. 
(maybe doing some research for Trish?)

Hi Grant,

Thanks for writing.  I have attached my resume and
transcripts for your perusal.

As you can see, my background is not finance.  I became
interested in finance via trading the markets.  So my
research interests initially revolved around the central
concept of trading....pricing, technical type thinking,
insider transactions, volume, and such.  But with exposure,
my interests have grown and I have discovered that I really
enjoy economics.  Also there are many issues in finance
that sound interesting as I am exposed to them.  The point
is, I am too early in my career to set strict limits on my
interests.

My goals are to get introduced to research and to new
ideas, to associate with good people, and to work on
strengthening my weaknesses.  I am interested in starting
to build a network within the field of finance and
especially quantitative finance.  Ultimately, I have to
prepare myself for independent research in order to succeed
in my field.

This brings me to my final point.  Publications are
important for me.  Thus I would want to work on topics that
Enron would be willing to publish.  I would be willing to
work on proprietary models, as long as there was a portion
of the research that could be written up for publication
without jeapordizing the proprietary aspects of the model.

Just to let you know.  I was not in Dr. Kao's energy class.
 I took his stochastic processes class.  Dr. Kao just
mentioned your talk to me as he thought I might be
interested in meeting you and learning more about what is
being done at Enron.

Thanks again.  If you need any more info or want anything
clarified, just write me.

effort.  I have attached a template for us to use and refer to for both the 
offers and the cultivations.   This serves as a two-fold communication tool:  
a tool for the team members to use in contacting the candidates and a tool 
for me to use when tracking any issues or concerns the candidates may have. 
Please feel free to add to it and e-mail it back to me or give me a call 
(EXT. 37632) and I will update it. 

       

I will also be using this to report back to A&A management.

Below are the names of the candidates that made it to the second round.  We 
want to call on all of them.

Blaise Nietcho  617-225-2598   blaise@mit.edu

Stinson Gibner, Vice President,  Reseach
Vincent Kaminsik, Managing Director,  Research
Enron Corp.
?
Gentlemen, 
Thank you for the opportunity to learn about a new  communication position 
within your group.??Based on our discussions,  here are some initial 
thoughts/observations on the job and the  task.
?
*Daily email newsletter for primarily two  audiences:
??? ???  ??? ??? ??? ???  1.? internal for employees available via the Enron  
intranet
??? ???  ??? ??? ??? ???  2.? external for clients, industry at large
?
*Also suggest the newsletter be sent to a  targeted group of trade press.? As 
this information tool builds  momentum and credibility, it will support the 
leadership positioning  of?Enron's Trading Group.?? Plus, it could become a 
driver for  media inquiries and?requests for further information or 
interviews with  Enron?trading experts.
?
*I heard you wanting internal and external  versions for both morning and 
afternoon distribution.??That  is an aggressive set of daily mailings. I 
would want to review the scope of the  content and look at the frequency.? 
Just like print  publications,?email newsletters are?now the rage and too 
many  are?landing in the email inboxes.??My counsel would be to start  with a 
manageable number and do it well.?You can always increase  frequency.? 
Difficult to cut back on frequency without it appearing as a  take away or 
lack of commitment to the product. Staffing?? 
?
*Invite outside industry analysts or  clients to provide commentary.
?
*Consider developing an "editorial advisory  board" to govern the 
content.??Traders,?legal  department, communications dept. A 
multidisciplinary group that?can add  value to the publication.
?
*Suggest finding an IMS or IT resource from  within Enron to be assigned to 
this communications  effort.??Database set up for the email addresses, 
technical  issues arise?for?creating the links etc.? Managing an  
e-newsletter in my current position, I can?tell you that a writer/editor  has 
enough to do to compile content.??You want mailings to go off  without any 
glitches.? Or if there are glitches, he or she can?solve  quickly.? What are 
the implications of these mailings on the company's  computer systems?? 
?
*Budget.? Although not a  typical print publication, this effort should have 
a budget.? Graphics,  freelance or contract writing, photography?any special 
software or hardware  needs associated with this effort?? 
?
*Review process.? What is the  review process for?this publication.? Legal 
guidelines??  Corporate guidelines with regards to style, graphics 
etc.??Technical  review of the material for accuracy?? A clear policy should 
be  established?up front for the review process so everyone involved knows 
and  understands their role and responsibilities?towards this communication  
effort.
?
*Have you surveyed what is out in the  marketplace???Gather samples 
of?newsletters that you  like or don't like for discussion purposes.
?
*Measurement/evaluation of the  newsletter.??How?will the effectiveness of 
the  newsletter be measured?? Hits on the website.? Inquiries from  clients?? 
Don't have a quick answer but?some goals should be set to  measure against.
?
*Maintenace of the mailing lists should  reside with the individual groups 
participating in the  newsletter.??Maintenance of the newsletter databases 
should  not be the responsibility of the communications representative.?  ??
?
This sent to you in the spirit of exploring the position further.?  Look 
forward to your feedback.??Thank you for your  consideration.? 
?
Sincerely,
Susan V. Gonzalez

Thank you for taking your time to interview me for opportunities at Enron. I
enjoyed talking you and learning more about Enron and its dynamic business

position in this industry. Please find the attached copy of my dissertation.
If you have any problem in compiling this file, please let me know.

I respected your insights and perspective on the issues addressed in my

of these models to simulate the future and help traders in the decision
making of their day to day business.

I appreciated talking with you. Thank you for considering me. I am
enthusiastic about opportunities at Enron and look forward to hearing from
you.

Sincerely

Subject:	RE: Resume

Vince,

	he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background (and then some credit exposure calculation) with not much credit data analysis experience.  I do not think he would be appropriate for Bryan's group -- he needs a person who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data, and although this guy may be good at modeling, we already have Iris and Amitava doing the modeling and looking at data.  At this stage, I would prefer to hire somebody with direct experience in credit analysis (banking, rating agency).  I am worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience, then Amitava will find himself with two people (Iris being the other one) who are both inexperienced in this area, and he will find himself doing a lot of the work anyway.
	If you want to pursue him, we should probably do a phone interview first.

Teresa,

I would like to invite Iris for an interview in Houston.
She works currently in London Can you call her
and ask when she is planning to visit the States.
We could pay the airfare from a location in the States.

I would hate to pay the 1st class ticket from London to Houston,
though I would go for it, if necessary (I don't
want a candidate to think that we are that cheap).
Business class is a standard
for business related, cross-Atlantic flights. 

I would be more comfortable if you could negotiate this issue.

Thanks 

Vince

     Currently I am working in Derivatives Structured Products and Risk
Management at BNP Paribas in London.  Although I currently enjoy living and
working in London, I may need to return to the states - because of my
mother's
failing health.

     Do you know of any good contacts at investment banks that I may
forward my

     For your information, I have attached my CV.  (Please see attached

     Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference
in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This
is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
detail?

     Thanks for your time and consideration.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Iris Mack

interested in designing sensors?

Cheers, Scott

he is OK with it. Just wanted to let you know.

Mike,

There might be a place for Steve in our unit supporting EES. I shall forward 
the resume to my associates supporting the Facility Management
effort.

Thanks for thinking about us.

Vince

P.S. Krishna, Osman,

Can you take a look at the attached resume? Steve has no finance background
but his engineering background is very strong.

Subject: our discussion

Vince & Stinson,

I was given your names by Lynn Dunphy in recruiting and am taking the liberty 
of forwarding you the attached CV.  Steve Roeder is a former collegiate 
swimmer and currently coach of the master's swimming program in The Woodlands 
(my wife is president of the program).  He is also currently employed at Air 
Liquide USA (or one of its subsidiaries) over in the Galleria area.  As a 
consequence of Air Liquide's pending merger with BOC, Steve believes that 
there will be significant personnel reductions sometime during 2000 and is 
taking action now to try to locate his next professional challenge.

Lynn suggested there might be a fit with your group and I would be grateful 
if you could have a look and let me know whether you might be interested.  
Alternatively, if you don't see a fit (or are adequately staffed at the 
moment), I would be grateful for any suggestions you might have as to whom I 
might contact internally on Steve's behalf.

Many thanks in advance.

Mike- 
Thanks for taking the time to talk last evening.? I really appreciated it.? 
(By the way, how is life in the White House now that you are living with a 
President?? Is Air Force One all that it is cracked up to be?)

Please see the attached document.? By reading between the lines, hopefully 
one can see that, whereas my training has been highly technical, my desire to 
transform my career into the business side of a high-technology application 
is set in this good foundation (rather than limited by it).

Thanks again for your support.

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience.  Publications are available on request.

I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email.

Thank you for your time.

Dear Shirley,

Can you please forward this thank you note to Kevin Kindall, Grant Masson,
Tanya Tamarchenko and
Vince Kaminski for me.

Dear Kevin, Grant, Tanya, and Vince:

I just wanted to thank you for the time you shared with me on Friday,
September 8th, regarding employment opportunities with Enron.  I enjoyed
meeting with you and discussing your company's structure and mission as well
as the objectives of the Research Group.  I was impressed by the fast-paced
environment and dedication that were displayed by your group.  It is apparent
to me that your group greatly contributes to the overall success of Enron.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,


Valeria Stone

Sure, tomorrow is fine with me.  Is it possible to schedule it at 3:30 PM?

And I am sure it is not an easy task to fit the schedule of several people
to
be available at the same time window.  So please feel free to let me know

Please do not think we are always this unorganized, but things just seem
to be happening right now and it is disrupting everyone's schedule.

Would you possibly be able to come tomorrow the 8th?  Kevin Kindall
will not be here on the 15th and he would definately like to interview you.
Then Vince Kaminski will be gone for two weeks after the 15th.  It seems
like tomorrow might be the best time for everyone, if it is for you.

We can begin the interviews at 3:00 PM and probably end them at 5:00
or 5:30 pm.

Please let me know.

Thanks so much for your understanding.

Definitely - any of these days sound good to me.  The only concern that I
have, is that I have my graduate class on Thursday night at 6 PM which is
September the 14th.
So if you will schedule the interview on the 14th of September, I would
need
to leave around 5:15 PM so I could attend  my  class.

It actually might be more convenient for me to meet with the interviewers
on
the 15th of September.  If this day does not fit the schedule of any of the
interested in interviewing individuals, I surely will be able to meet with
them on the 14th.

I will be looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

Valeria Stone

Would you be able to do the interview on the 14th or 15th instead of the
13th?  Vince Kaminski, who would really like to interview you, has been
called out of town on the 13th.  He will be back on the 14th.

Also Grant Masson is conducting an Options Seminar on the 13th and
would not be able to interview you until after 5:00 PM.

Please let me know if we can just push the interview to the same time
frame only on the 14th or 15th.

Hi, Vince,

This is Li, writing from U. of Chicago.
I am in the second quarter here.
The study and social life is extremely busy at the school.
But I enjoy connecting the knowledge I learn everyday here
with the experience I had with Enron.

A schoolmate of mine, a Chicago Ph.D. candidate in finance,
is looking for an internship for the coming summer.
I recommend him to write to you to see if you are interested in
or if there is a need. If so, you can contact with him directly.
He is a really bright guy. If not, hope you don't mind that
I sell Enron at school so hard.

Again, thanks for all the help you gave me.
Have a good new year.

Li

P.S.: Cover letter below and resume attached.

Subject: Possible hire?



Dear Vince,

A faculty member in our department, namely Dr. Keith Baggerly,
 is interested in pursuing other employment. He is currently an
assistant professor in our program and a highly valued member  of
our department. We hate to lose him, however his interest has shifted
from the academic arena to one of high level but practical application
and development of statistical methodologies including
stochastic modeling.

Keith is actually a graduate of our Ph.D. program; he was in the same
group of students as Martin Lawera. Keith spent several years at Los
Alamos National Lab before we recruited him back to Rice. He has
been on our faculty now for three years and it is my expectation
(and that of my colleagues) that if he remained he would receive
tenure.

Keith has a strong interest in financial models and the background
to support his interest. He is also a leading expert in statistical
computing, empirical likelihood, categorical models and areas
of statistics falling under the general bailiwick of "data mining".
He is a creative thinker.

I do not know if there are possibilities for Keith within your group,
however
I believe it is an excellent match of talent and objectives.  Would you
have an interest in speaking with Keith? If so, I will suggest that he
contact you.

Best regards,

Kathy Ensor

Good Morning,

I enjoyed visiting you yesterday afternoon to discuss the opportunity at
Enron.  Sounds exciting, challenging and a good use of a lot of my skills and
experience.  I look forward to further talks, hopefully this coming week.

I mentioned a couple web sites and don't know if they came through clearly on
the phone with my sore throat.

The neural network approach to timing can be found at
http://www.pfr.com/ptonline/

The introductory piece on technical analysis I wrote for Forbes.com and the
glossary can be found at htttp://www.forbes.com/tool/html/00/Jun/0603/feat.htm

I am also working with long time friend and neighbor Steve Nison with his
site and you can see the first on line lesson for free at

Have a nice weekend.  Hope to hear from you next week.

Dear Vincent and Stinson,

Both my students would love to come visit you guys for an informal
visit in the near future. Please let me know well ahead of time
when they can come. If possible, see to it that their parking expenses
be paid when they do come.


I'll be in touch with you all over the next months about this and
a possible postdoctoral/trainee agreement (World Lab.).

Cheers,

Carlos

Vince,
Just wanted to follow up on our conversation yesterday regarding Kin Tso.  
Charlene actually called Kin yesterday to let him know that your group was 
interested in him as a direct hire and would be contacting him this week.  As 
we discussed, Kin was told that his quantitative skills were a much better 
fit for your group instead of our rotating Associate program.  We let him 
know that the Associate program would not be making him an offer but he is 
being considered for a direct hire.  Kin was receptive and is looking forward 
to hearing from you.  We will consider this issue closed from the Associate 
and Analyst Program.  We hope that you might find a direct hire fit for him 
in your area.  If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  
Thanks so much.

Vince:   Jaesoo Lew has just returned my phone call.   He is interested in 
meeting with you and your group, and would like to do so on Wednesday, 
10/25/2000.   He had already made travel arrangements to fly to a conference 
in Seattle on 10/25, but is willing to come here for the interviews first and 
then travel from Houston to Seattle for the seminar.   He did ask if we would 
be willing to reimburse him for the additional cost of the ticket, and I told 
him I was sure that you would consider it.    
Dr. Lew asked that we schedule his flight into Houston for some time after 
6:00 pm on Tuesday, 10/24/2000.   I will work on the travel arrangements 
tomorrow morning, and keep you advised.   

Please call me with any questions,
Molly

like Vince, Ronnie & myself to talk to Ming over the phone. Can we call him

Subject: Re: Ming Sit  

Got a little scared at your first sentence I read "He is no replacement for 
Jay but he could be for Dennis B .."??.

Anyway:

I think he would be a good fit withing the group.  Krisna has offered to hire 
him in the research group, he has good programing background and is excited 
about working for Enron instead of a Utility such as PacificCorp.  He 
expressed interest in applying his skill to make $$$$. 

I suggest bringing him in in research as a first alternative.  I see three 
potential applications where we can use his skills to evaluate best longer 
term fit:
Continuing Ronnie's model building role, but with a focus within Neil's group 
to tie RM systems together
Bridge the lack of Phd Econometrics expertise we have as are result of the 
departure of Anoush.
Risk Management Systems Infrastructure development.

Subject: Ming Sit

He is no replacement for Jay but he could be a Dennis B employee.

Pros:
Engineer so would be good at math
His boss hired him a 2nd time (1at TXU and again at Pacificor again) so he 
must be reliable
Phd in Economics and Engineering (good) from Stanford (ugh :) :) :) )

Cons:
Does not understand Tariffs.  I asked him and he said he is not experienced.  
I probed too and he does not understand regulatory that well.
Does not understand Ancillary Services (which is surprising to me since he 
started out as an plant operation side of HK Power)
Has limited people management skills (he described 1 analyst he works with 
that is not capable that he has to jump into the excel spreadsheet and fix it 
for him and he cannot give him feedback because it is a utility mentality)
He is not a good communicator (I asked him to describe what he did in HK 
Power and it took him forever to explain because he expected me to know that 
plant operations meant planning the start up of oil plants).

Overall:  
I suspect that he is a very solid guy when it comes to analysis but not 
particularly creative or good at communication and leadership.  He would be a 
great support person.
I would hire for analysis but not as a potential leader.Go

Hi Vince and Molly.
Here attached is one candidate who is particularly interested in having his 
profile sent to Vince...he is going to be traveling to NY from the UK soon 
for 2 wks.
He specifically asked my partner at RobertWalters in the UK to investigate 
Enron through my new relationship with you guys. He would be Howard Haughton, 
attached below (CV).

The other 2 resumes are my students at the University of Michigan. Howard Lin 
received a 4.0/4.0 for his last term and will be willing to do whatever it 
takes to intern at Enron for June- Aug. I have his picture included as well. 
The second is Sung, they are friends. Howy will be done expected in May 2001 
and Sung in May 2002. They are my favorite interns and I expect they can be 
cultivated to the Enron culture with no real cost to you (a "test drive 
before committal. I have agreed to represent them and
shall take ownership, as they become graduate candidates upon their degree 
completion.

I hope these attachment can represent my value and commitment to quality of 
talent to Enron.

Thank you for your acceptance.
Best wishes for the weekend.
Jeff

Thank you very much for arranging the follow-up interview with your internal

Benevides at EES yesterday. I was impressed with level of risk technology 
employed by Enron to achieve its business objectives. I want to reiterate my 
strong interest in joining your group, which is held in very high esteem both 
inside and outside of Enron.? I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Dr. Kaminski,
thanks for your mail.

I am sorry that I'll not be available earlier,
I will talk with my advisor, but
probably it will be pretty negative.
however, I may be able to start it from June1,
depending on what he tells..
We will meet tomorrow afternoon,
so I'll be able to let you know
whether we can start work earlier then.

And could you tell me briefly
what are those projects you have in mind?

Thanks!

Vince,

Paulo and I talked to Mr. Zhang on the phone.  He is currently with
Kock equity trading and formly a quant supporting power trading.
His power market experience could be valuable to us.

I would recommend to bring him for an on-site interview.  

Since we get more demanding power projects,  Alex needs some help.

Dear Giuseppe:

Unfortunately, I am no longer with the Associate and Analyst recruiting

Warner, who is now responsible for recruiting.  She will be able to assist 
you directly.  Tracy can be contacted at Tracy.Warner@Enron.com.  I would 
also recommend having Vince Kaminski contact her as well to ensure that all 
communications are in order.

Best regards,

Celeste, my name is Giuseppe A. Paleologo and you amy remember me: I was
a summer intern last summer in the research group, and attended the
hiring event this year at Stanford. In that occasion I had an informal
offer from Vince Kaminski, and the assurance that I would receive a
written one in the following two weeks, but since then I have not
received any letter from Enron. I would like to know if the offer is
still valid, and if it has been sent. I am asking because I am in the
process of evaluating my offers, and would like to wait for Enron before
I make my final decision.

Thanks in advance,

Giuseppe Paleologo

Hi Vince,

If you are still interested in bringing back this gentleman back for another 
interview, I would very much like to meet with him.  Sean talked with him 
when you brought him in a few weeks ago and he thought it would be a good 
idea for me to meet with him so we can compare thoughts.  

Thanks, Kim.

This is a letter from one of the job applicants who works for PROS.
It seems that the system they develop for Williams
is more a scheduling system.

Would you like to ask him to come back for another interview,
to get more information out of him?

Dear Vince:

It was so nice meeting and talking with you too. I did
not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in
Enron.

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I
have been working two years as Lead Scientist and
Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue
Management Inc. in Houston.

I developed and implemented the mathematical models
for Trading Optimization System and Firm
Transportation Optimization System.

The Trading Optimization System becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the
contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years.

Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management. I am
confident that I can make significant contributions to
Enron in this area.

I would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
Enron.

Sincerely Yours


Jacob

Hi again,

I am visiting several family members and friends over the next few days.
Therefore it will be hard to contact me.

However, next week I will be easier to reach.  My contact details in NYC are
as follows. I will be staying at the following hotels:

Washington Square Hotel
from November 28th for 3 nights (Tue, Wed and Thur)
212.777.9515

Marriott NYC Financial
December 1st for 1 night (Fri)
212.385.4900


At any rate, I will still try to reach you on tomorrow morning.  If all
fails, we will try to reach each other next week.

Happy Thanksgiving,

respect to a PhD program.  Unfortunately our only related program here is
in statistics.  I would suggest that you contact Professor Sheridan Titman

                            Dear Mr. Kaminski:

                            I would  like to explore the opportunity to join 
Enron Investment Partners. I understand that Enron has $20 million fund set 
up to finance start-ups, and Gene Humphreys and his assistant John Godbold 
are trying to attract minority -owned start-up firms. I also learned that 
Enron has plans to increase the size of this fund to $200 million. I can find 
these opportunities for Enron around the Globe. Given my background as a 
Chartered Financial Analyst, with hands-on experience in investment 
management covering financial derivatives, fixed income, and equity, I can be 
a valuable resource to do the due diligence, origination, valuation, and 
monitoring of these start-ups. Would you please help me arrange a meeting 
with either Gene Humphreys, Ted Murphy, or may be Ken Lay?

I am pasting below the job opportunities open at Enron. I am also interested 
in these positions and would like to meet with the hiring manager.

I will give you a call to follow up.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Hi Vince.
I spoke with Molly McGee down in HR- we are getting the paperwork together.
I will send you those candidates we talked about next.
********************************************************
Just to let you know why I contacted you...

Every Student at the better universities including those in the UK- ask 
either for you or Enron.

I saw Enron was voted the BEST company to work for out of 10 in the world 
andthere are countless articles in the Financial Times on Enron. For this I 
am thankful to know you now!
********************************************************
Did you know why my grandfather changed his name from Wesloski to 
Wesley?...When he came from Poland to work as an autoworker in 
Detroit...there was alot of anti-polish sentiment and he was beaten and 
intimidated to the point where he was afraid for his life and the saftey of 
the family. He then changed the name to the English derivative from WESLOSKI 
to "Wesley". Nevertheless, they kicked his teeth out of his mouth and beat 
him senseless many times. I may change it back...I don't know.

OK- I will get everything together for you and Molly!
Thank you for the opportunity to work with you Vince and Enron.

Thank you,
Jeff

Dr. Kaminski,
thanks for your mail.

I am sorry that I'll not be available earlier,
I will talk with my advisor, but
probably it will be pretty negative.
however, I may be able to start it from June1,
depending on what he tells..
We will meet tomorrow afternoon,
so I'll be able to let you know
whether we can start work earlier then.

And could you tell me briefly
what are those projects you have in mind?

Thanks!

Vince and Stinson,

I got this resume from my friend Ming Sit who has a Ph.D. from Stanford.
Please take a look at his resume to see if we can use him.  I classify him as
a structurer, but things may change after all these years.

How are you.  It was really a pleasure meeting you and talking to you at
the Toronto energy derivative conference.  Thank you for speaking with
me about the possibility of visiting your research group.  It will be
great if I could have such opportunity whenever you see your schedule
fits.  I am very much open for the last week of July and early August.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in 
becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab 
experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back 
to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the 
attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel 
I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the 
qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

Mike, below are some references on Bruce.   Sorry for the delay.  We needed 
to get the contact info from him.  Call me if you have questions.  

MCM: I was able to verify dates and position as well as a positive reference 
to his ability to work on a team , complete projects timely.  And stated that 
he was a "great guy".

Dr. Carl Palash:  was a co-manager at MCM.  Confirmed all that Bruce listed 
on his resume as what they had worked on and stated that Bruce is considerate 
and that he would work with Bruce or hire him if he had the opportunity in 
the future.

David Krell:  Helped co-coordinate  Graduate level classes re: Technical 
Analysis at Rutgers.  Bruce is now the lead teacher and the course is highly 
regarded, gets positive reviews and has a full enrollment each time it is 
offered.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee.

Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing
analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++
programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron.

My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in
this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

Dear Mike

I would like to apply for the above position as advertised in "EARTHWORKS" and
enclose my full CV (In Word 97/00 format) in support.

I am currently a research Fellow with UCL conducting research, and building
forecasting models for the statistical prediction of North Atlantic Sea 
Surface
Temperatures and other climatic parameters at long leads (1-12 months ahead of
forecast period).

I have recently applied this model to the North Sea in order to aid long-lead
forecasts of Fish Stocks (see SAP-symposium, 4-6 December, Bergen, Norway), 
and
have recently been applying similar models to the North Atlantic Oscillation, 
an
atmospheric phenomena which is strongly correlated with winter climate over
UK/Norway and NW Europe, particularly temperatures, rainfall and windspeeds 
(see
enclosed poster which was presented recently at an international conference on
the NAO in Vigo, Spain)

As you will see from my CV, I have 2+ years experience consulting in several
areas of geoscience to the oil, gas and minerals industries and have good
programming skills, both on Unix machines and on PCs.

I am particularly keen to apply my skills in the commercial sector and 
initiate
a permanent career path.

I look forward to the opportunity of hopefully discussing my skills further 
with
you in the near future.

Yours sincerely

Tony Hamilton

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience.  Publications are available on request.

I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email.

Thank you for your time.

                            I would  like to explore the opportunity to join 
Enron Investment Partners. I understand that Enron has $20 million fund set 
up to finance start-ups, and Gene Humphreys and his assistant John Godbold 
are trying to attract minority -owned start-up firms. I also learned that 
Enron has plans to increase the size of this fund to $200 million. I can find 
these opportunities for Enron around the Globe. Given my background as a 
Chartered Financial Analyst, with hands-on experience in investment 
management covering financial derivatives, fixed income, and equity, I can be 
a valuable resource to do the due diligence, origination, valuation, and 
monitoring of these start-ups. Would you please help me arrange a meeting 
with either Gene Humphreys, Ted Murphy, or may be Ken Lay?

I am pasting below the job opportunities open at Enron. I am also interested 
in these positions and would like to meet with the hiring manager.

I will give you a call to follow up.

Thank you.

Dear Vince Kaminski,
 I was auditing Prof Dyer's Real Options class on Thursday when you spoke
on Enron's activities in this area.  I would be interested in exploring the
possibility of joining the group that works on real options in response to
and in anticipation of Enron's business requirements.  I'm currently
working in the development and application of real options methodology at
Schlumberger.  In particular I'll be speaking at an industry Real Options
Valuation conference in London (http://www.iqpc.co.uk/finance/rov/) and I
just had the paper accepted for publication in Operations Research.  Could
you pass my resume on to the relevant people to have a look at?

Thanks in advance,

Chris Kenyon

Iris,

I shall go through my Rolodex and try to find some good leads for you. I left
investment banking 8 years ago and this field changes very fast.

Alternatively, would you be interested in a company like Enron
or another energy company in Houston?

Please, let me know.

Hi,

     How are you?  Thank you kindly for your email.  Sorry I have not 
responded
sooner.

     Currently I am working in Derivatives Structured Products and Risk
Management at BNP Paribas in London.  Although I currently enjoy living and
working in London, I may need to return to the states - because of my mother's
failing health.

     Do you know of any good contacts at investment banks that I may forward 
my
details to?

     For your information, I have attached my CV.  (Please see attached file:
Iris Marie Mack.doc).

     Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.


Kind regards,

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference
in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This
is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
detail?

     Thanks for your time and consideration.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Iris Mack

I enjoyed meeting you both yesterday to discuss my sincere interest in the 
research group.

Since many of the rotations for analysts are pre-determined, I think it is 
best for me to wait until my candidacy
for the analyst program is finalized.

Thank you for your interest in my skill-set. I am enrolled in the CFA 
program, have completed numerous futures/options
courses in undergraduate school, and am confident that my profile will be 
well-received after completing your in-house
project which will be utilized to test certain skills.

I'll talk to you soon after my discussions with the analyst program.

Regards,
David

Kristin,

The problem with this guy is that we maxed out on the number of interns we
can gainfully employ and provide adequate supervision. So, we have to pass on 
him.

Dear Ms. Gandy:

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to visit the Owen
Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt on January 23-24 for on-campus
interviews for the Summer Associate positions at Enron. It was a pleasure
talking with you, and I hope I conveyed to you how excited I am about the
prospect of applying my skills at Enron.

I realize that Enron offers a limited number of positions and greatly
respect your choice of Summer Associates. I would like to ask you if there
is any opportunity for me to work at Enron during this summer for free. I am
confident that my sincere interest in derivatives will allow me to greatly
contribute to Enron during this summer. I am particularly interested in
Enron Research Group. (I had a phone interview with Mr. Gibner on January
31st, and I sent him email yesterday asking for the opportunity to work for
free during this summer).

I am looking forward to hearing from you. If I can provide more information
or answer additional questions, please feel free to contact me either by
telephone (615-496-1132) or via e-mail
(Dmitri.Villevald@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu). Also, I am always ready to fly
to Houston for additional interviews.

Again, thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Dmitri Villevald

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee.

Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing
analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++
programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron.

My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in
this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

Celeste, my name is Giuseppe A. Paleologo and you amy remember me: I was
a summer intern last summer in the research group, and attended the
hiring event this year at Stanford. In that occasion I had an informal
offer from Vince Kaminski, and the assurance that I would receive a
written one in the following two weeks, but since then I have not
received any letter from Enron. I would like to know if the offer is
still valid, and if it has been sent. I am asking because I am in the
process of evaluating my offers, and would like to wait for Enron before
I make my final decision.

Thanks in advance,

Giuseppe Paleologo

Hi Rachel. Please read the following email from my collegue in the UK who 
spoke directly to Howard a bit ago by tele about Wed/Thurs interview.
Can we do this alternative he suggested? We will have to reschedule- maybe 
NY? or after Howards trip in Houston?
Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Jeff,

 I've bad news. Howard is off to New York on Wednesday for 10 days until the
 10th of Feb. Either Enron could fly him to Houston after his holiday or
 maybe Vince's team could get out to New York. Let me know.

Hi Jens,

anbei findest Du meinen CV in Englisch als pdf-File.

Ein Treffen in Austin wuerde mir gut passen. Diesen Feitag wegen sehr spaeter 
Ankunft ausgenommen, ginge es prinzipiell an beiden Wochenenden. Ich muesste 
allerdings vorher noch abklaeren, was meine Schwiegereltern konkret an Events 
geplant haben. Wann wuerde es Dir denn passen? Ich gebe Dir jetzt auf jeden

Vince and Ravi,

Below is a message from the student whose resume I forwarded to you earlier 
this week.  Vince, I suspect he may be best suited for your group, but I 
don't know what your current needs are.  Unfortunately, I'm leaving Enron and 
my last day is Friday of this week, so I won't be around to help this guy 
through the process or host him when he is here.  Can either of you suggest 
someone I can ask to handle this for you if you're interested in him?

Thanks.

Regards,
Laura

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

        I sent my resume to your well respected company a few weeks ago
in regards to establishing a long-lasting career with them. I never
received a response and was wondering if you knew who was in charge of
the electric power disbatching/scheduling department or know of who I
may contact to inquire this information? I know you are a very busy
professional and I apologize for the inconvenience.  Thank you for your
valuable time.

Warmest Regards,
Eric Hilton

Shirley,

 Phil Roan, the quantitative analyst from Koch's weather derivatives group 
will be here on the afternoon of Friday June 16, beginning say, at 1:30 or 
2:00. Vince asked me to ask you to put a set of interviews together (as I 
understand, Vince himself will be unavailable that day). 

 Mark Tawney should see him; someone from weather marketing and/or 
structuring should see him, e.g. Gary Taylor and/or Michael Nguyen; some more 
people from research should grill him on technical and meteorology issues, 
e.g. Vasant and/or Zimin as well as Mike Roberts or someone on his team. Phil 
has only been a "quant" since the departure of Koch's previous weather quant 
in February; before that he was Koch's weather "risk manager". I am still not 
sure what the distinction means, but we do need to find out how much he knows 
about option pricing and meteorology. Even though his expressed desire is to 
focus on weather derivatives, we should also assess how useful he would be 
from research group's perspective, since research will likely be his official 
home.

 Finally, Jere Overdyke and/or someone else from his group (George Carrick, 
if available) should also get a chance to meet with him. I've already spoken 
with Phil, but I'd like to sit in with either Vasant or Zimin or Mike when 
they interview him, since I wasn't able to ask any technical questions.

 If I'm counting correctly, that should amount to five interview sessions, 
perhaps less if we interview in groups of two. Phil's resume is enclosed 
below.

Joe

P.S. I will also forward this to Jason Sokolov. He will let you know if any 
people from RAC would also like to meet with him.

Hi Vince,

This resume looks quite good.  We may wish to talk to him on the phone.  However, now that David Hoog has hired his own actuarial guys (Alex Tartakowski and Larry Markus) from Ace, I am not sure if they require support on the actuarial side.  With Don Black (of Global Risk Markets) leaving Enron, I think the effort to develop power products for the insurance markets is pretty much nonexistent, except for David Hoog's product.  The resume still looks interesting, though.

Dear Sir/Madam,

 I am a student in a Master's programme in Mathematical Finance due to graduate in August. My intention upon graduation is to work in a quantitative capacity in the
 Power markets and to this end, I am including my resume  in the hope that I might be considered for any available position in your risk
 management or structured products group requiring such mathematical skills.

I have addressed this email to your graduate programmes address but I am unsure whether or not my candidacy would fall under the umbrella covered by your associate programme. If this is not the case, any help in seeing that my resume finds the correct destination would be greatly appreciated.

 Yours sincerely,


 Ian McCracken

Hi again,


     I don't recall if I mentioned that my Harvard Doctoral dissertation
involved another energy problem - the Transient Stability of Electrical
Power Systems.

     Much of the data, model and analysis was done with lots of
collaborative efforts with my advisors at Harvard and MIT and with the
Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto.


Kind regards,
Iris Mack

Stinson,

Thank you for your e-mail.  My phone number is (617) 492-9551.  I don't
have a currect resume, but if I did it would say that I graduated from
Princeton University in 1996 (mathematics), and came straight to MIT for a
PhD in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.  In my first
three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics,
optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses in
psychology (at MIT and Harvard).  I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran,
and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.  In
particular, I am interested in the interaction between customers and
companies (hence the interest in psychology).  The (tentative) title of my
PhD thesis is "Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet", and I am
sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will
give you an idea of what this research is about.

Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your research
group next week.

Paulo


Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet


Objective:

To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold
on
the internet.


Motivation:

This reseach is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization
models are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.  The technological
innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
information
which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.
Furthermore,
companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can
have access to.

The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue
faced
by internet companies.  Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g,
VCRs
or computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.  Companies can show
different products and different prices to each consumer.  This type of
flexibility
was not available until the internet came about.

The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.  The
methodology developed by this research should be transferrable to a number of
other settings, such as pricing services.  Services are unique, and there are
many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a
given company.  Our model will help companies decide which services to offer
to which customers and how much to charge for these services.


Research Strategy:

Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components
which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.  These
components are choice models and optimization models.


Choice Models:

Choice models describe how customers make choices.  The management literature
draws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.  The
common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic
elimination methods.  These methods consist of the elimination of options
based on the sequential eliminations of features until only one choice
remains.
These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves very
easily to mathematical analysis.  Economists focus on utility-maximing models
that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological
models.
The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.  The problem with
these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how
consumer make choices on the internet.  The first step in our research will
be
to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between
customers
and companies on the internet.

Optimization:

Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a
certain planning horizon.  On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenue
still exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.  Short term
profit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you know
your customers and are able to retain them.  The optimization problem must
therefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component
(learning).

Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

regards

Steve

Ms. Crenshaw,

 Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the
opportunity to talk to personnel from the Research Group at Enron. Between
the two days you suggest, I prefer Wednesday 12/6. Considering the
two-hour time difference between California and Texas, 11:00 am Pacific
time (1:00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most
of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end,
please let me know.

 Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your
colleagues.

Hi Molly:

I guess it is time to try and schedule Frank's interview.  We would like to
bring him in sometime around the first of February (when Krishna returns).

Please contact him and see what a good time for him would be.  

Attached is his resume and Interview Request form.

Hello Molly and Cheryl:

Attached is Frank's resume.  We still have quite a bit of time as we want to
schedule this for after Krishna returns on the 25th of January. 

This position would be for the Research Group directly, and would include
all of Vince's direct reports.

Thanks and MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

        Dear Vince:

        It is my understanding that Ms. Kate Szablya (whom you apparently
met this past week) of Power Brokers has expressed to you my interest in
considering the possibility of working at ENRON. In addition I belive that
she has forwarded to you my CV.

        My communication with Ms. Szablya has been less than satisfactory
for some time. Therefore Ms. Szablya is nolonger representing me and I would
like Ms. Rita de Claris (whom I cc) of De Claris & Associates (713 - 868 -
4440) to represent me in the future in this search. I have instructed her to
forward my CV to you once more.

        Forgive me for this, perhaps unusual, step but I regard highly the
opportunity of working at ENRON and do not feel I am being adequately
represented at present.

        I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        Best regards

        Joao

Dear Vince:

It was great talking to you on Friday. Thank you very
much for the opportunity and your time.

After having talked with you and other people in the
group, I was very impressed by Enron research group's
deep insights, high professionalism, and the friendly
attitude. I really wish that I could have the
opportunity to join the group and contribute to the
future success of the research group with my solid
background in finance and econometrics.

If you have any questions, please feel free to let me
know. I look forward to hearing from you soon, thank
you very much.

sincerely,
Charles

Dear Vince,
I enjoyed very much meeting you at the EPRM  conference.  
As agreed, I am attaching both my resume and  the paper on my dissertation work, which I will be presenting at the Real  Options Conference in UCLA next month.  I would be delighted to have your  comments and impressions on it.
If it is of interest to you, I would also be  very enthusiastic about exploring together different powerful  ways of applying these concepts at Enron.
 
Early congratulations on your son's graduation; let  me know if you come to the Bay Area soon.
Best regards,

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  I seemed to have lost contact with you.  The last contact
was with a Ms. Graham - regarding my coming to Houston for an interview -
while I was still living in London.

     I am now back in the states - where I spent the last few months working
for a dot.com.  Although this internet opportunity was interesting, it was
not a viable one.  I guess part of the technology firm shake out.

     Therefore I am now interviewing again - with investment banks and
insurance companies.  Is Enron still interested in having me come down for
an interview?  If so, please let me know how to proceed.

     Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Iris Mack

Hi, Mr. Kaminski:


How are you? I hope you had a wonderful holiday. I just came back from
Chicago.

There is an Enron on Campus interview at CMU scheduled on  12/11. Is this
the interview for our class or for MBA students? I am concerned because I
was not selected for this interview, and I would like very much to have a
chance to talk you about what I can do at Enron.

Frank

Ms. Crenshaw,

 Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the
opportunity to talk to personnel from the Research Group at Enron. Between
the two days you suggest, I prefer Wednesday 12/6. Considering the
two-hour time difference between California and Texas, 11:00 am Pacific
time (1:00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most
of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end,
please let me know.

 Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your
colleagues.

Jingming

My feedback:

 Philip has an excellent CV and background --- PhD coursework at University 
of Chicago, and work experience at Long Term Capital (hopefully he learned 
something).   His views are somewhat idealistic --- his aim is to make 
bid-offers in any product, and he could not really address how he would 
handle illiquidity.  Nevertheless, if Bryan needs traders, he can fit the 
role.
 Zak seemed somewhat unfocused.  He has worked on a variety of projects, but 
does not have any specific view in mind as to what he would like to do.  He 
seemed very academically oriented, and might be hard to communicate and work 
with.  I do not see him working in the trenches, and I do not see him leading 
the group either.  He would be a good person to brainstorm ideas with.

I work with Melanie Doyle in London HR.  I have two candidates who I'm trying 
to arrange (for Bryan Seyfried) to come in and see Vince Kaminski however I'm 
finding it difficult to co-ordinate from this end.  Would it be possible for 
you to forward these CV's on to Vince's assistant as I'm not sure who the 
correct person is.

Thanks for your help and if you need more details my number is 44 20 7783

Vince,

Thanks for forwarding the resume.  We have generally had great success with 
ex-Koch people.
He sounds might like he may be a good fit for Michael L. Miller in principal 
investments.  At this point
I have very recently inherited two other stron VPs from EI and therefore will 
probably focus on a few
Manager and Associates for the near term but I would like to keep James' 
resume for further opportunities.
He sounds like someone we should at least meet with and figure out a spot 
within Wholesale Services.
What do you think?

Regards,

-Larry-

Greg,

As you may know, Brad Romine's dot.com venture fell apart.

The offer from Enron looks much better now. I have arranged for him
a number of different interviews (including one with you). I think we should 
not be too
punitive and give him the 2nd chance. I am also setting up for him interviews 
with RAC
and EBS  and he should be able to negotiate a good first rotation.

Please, give me a call if you have any other question.

Vince,

Chonawee and Tom Halliburton had  feedback about Jacob to me.

Tom's feedback is what he does for Pros is actually too simple. Their so-called 
trading system is actually a scheduling system.

My impression is that Jacob is good at selling himself, his knowledge
of finance and derivatives is very limited.

Subject:	Jacob feedback


I asked Jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge. He answered correctly in the optimization question so I believe that he has a good foundation on his optimization skill. I have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in Stochastic Processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models. If we had more interview time I would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills.

He completely failed to answer the second question, which is to check his basic risk management skill. It is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management. He does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk. He showed some weakness in annuity calculation.
 
In conclusion, I feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance. Based on his experiences, I have a doubt on his advance optimization skills, such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem. I would recommend a second-round interview if he will be solving a complex-optimization problem.

Rick,

Aram is coming to Houston, in my view, to explore the possibility of coming 
back to Enron
(given uncertain situation under the Scottish rule at the old Pacificorp). 

I shall suggest that he meet  with you and/or Ted Murphy as well.

I can wait for Karen to come back. It's not urgent. We are still working on
the volumetric  risk module and the team is making a very good progress.
They gave a  presentation today to Rick Carson and me.

We have to decide what comes next  (Asset/Liability Model or
Operational Risk Model).

        Dear  Vince:
 
        Thank you for  the invitation yesterday. It was a pleasure to meet you all and learn more about  the group, it's structure and to some extent what you are involved in. Please  extend my thanks to all of them.
 
        I am  particularly interested in the Credit Swap trading platform that Enron has  recently started. Such a platform will provide unique visibility into the Credit  markets. As you suggested I tried to learn more about this from Tanya. I  would like to learn more and if possible meet other people more directly linked  to the effort.
 
        Just simple  instruments like Credit Swaps will require serious modelling capability for the  pricing and the hedging of these apparently simple intruments. The market  visibility I mention above can be explored through Credit Derivatives Trading  successfully if Enron possesses superior (vis a vis Morgan Stanley, Salomon  Smith Barney, Chase Manhatan, etc.) modelling technology in Credit  Derivatives. I can and would like to consider the possibility of doing this  for Enron. I would like to help develop and participate in putting together that  business.
 
        As I  mentioned to you I have done some work in Credit Derivatives and am deeply  familiar with virtually all the work of the principal academics in Credit  Derivatives namely: Duffie, Lando, Tuffano, Duffee, Das, Lelland, etc. I have  read carefully most of their work (published as well as working papers) on the  subject to date.
 
        I look  forward to hearing from you.
 
        Best  regards
 
         Joao

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

        I sent my resume to your well respected company a few weeks ago
in regards to establishing a long-lasting career with them. I never
received a response and was wondering if you knew who was in charge of
the electric power disbatching/scheduling department or know of who I
may contact to inquire this information? I know you are a very busy
professional and I apologize for the inconvenience.  Thank you for your
valuable time.

Here is a picture of Howard Lin and picture of Lawrence (the guy I spoke to 
you about over the telephone) and his new resume.
I will call Alec tonight in London to let him know that you sent the "other 
Howard" (Howard Haughton over to Enron UK).
Lawrence has Banking and Online experience with HSBC- he is being examined 
only by one other company that I know of (Williams) that is my competitor. He 
also went to the Chief Investment Officer of the San Diego Pension Fund (a 
friend of mine). I don't think he is a "best fit"- but, If you like him- I'll 
get him for you!
I have a great relationship with him.
OK!
Thanks,
Jeff Wesley

Ps- I kinda like Lawrence's "look", Vince.


ALWAYS HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE.

How did it go with Renshi Zhang and Bill Koures?  Renshi has two offers
already.  If you want to persue him, I would recommend moving quickly.

Subject: Mike Catanese's resume



I am a Ph.D. physicist and have worked for the last five years in
post-doctoral researcher positions in astrophysics.  A few months ago, I
realized that I had reached the limit of my academic career options, at least
for the near future.  After reading about careers in the private sector and
discussing possibilities with some family members and friends, it became
apparent that my technical and mathematical skills could be transferred to
the private sector, with better long-term career options and a more dynamic
workplace environment than in academic research.  The energy industry is
particularly attractive as it begins to deregulate.  I have been directed to
Enron by several different people as a very forward-thinking and growing
company and one which values its employees.

Because of my statistical and mathematical skills, I am interested in a
position as a quantitative analyst.  However, if there are other areas where
the people at Enron think I could contribute, I am open to other options.  My
other experience, such as project management, is outlined in my resume.  I
have worked in a collaboration of 30 astrophysicists from the US, Ireland,
and England and I am a capable independent worker as well.  I have excellent
written and oral communication skills and have made presentations to
audiences ranging from technical experts to school-aged children.

Thank you again for your time and effort in passing this resume on.  I look
forward to talking with you.

Sincerely,

Mike Catanese

Hi Vince,

Thanks for taking the time off to meet with me last week. I did enjoy
meeting you and your co-workers in the Research Group.

I do realize my background may not be the best fit for the type of work
done in your division. I'll be job hunting over the next several weeks,
and would really appreciate it if you could let let me know if something
opens up at Enron. Thanks again and best regards.

Van,

Thanks for your message. We are taking a  number of interns this summer,  but 
the A&A
program has closed the books for this year. We were able to reopen the list
to add one candidate a few weeks ago, but cannot do it again. We promised it 
would be the last addition.

Vince

Subject: summer


Dear Vince, 

I'm writing to let you know that I have been in touch with Christy Young from 
the A&A Program and will be finding out my assignment for this summer soon.? 
I am very excited to be back at Enron, and I hope to see the Research team 
again. 

I'd also like to inquire about summer positions within Research.? Will the 
Research group be taking on another intern this summer?? Since I know there 
is no busier place at Enron than the Research Group, if there is a position 
available for this summer that you are looking to fill or that may be open 
for consideration, I would love to connect you to another Rice student. 

Please let me know if the Group is considering receiving a new intern this 
summer.? If so, I would be thrilled to put you in touch with Brad Aimone, a 
senior chemical engineering student here at Rice who will be graduating with 
both his B.S. and his Masters in Chemical Engineering next May.? Brad has 
gained extensive laboratory research experience over the past two years.? His 
academic focus gives him a strong mathematical, quantitative background and 
excellent computer skills.? I believe his skills are transferable and 
relevant to the Group, and he is a deeply dedicated individual.? If the 
Research Group is looking for a summer intern, I hope it will continue 
Enron's strong support and recruit of Rice University students. 

Please feel free to contact Brad directly to pursue this discussion. (As I 
realize the summer months are not far off, if it is easier, an arrangement 
through ProStaff may be made similar to my work extension at the end of last 
summer).? I have attached a copy of his resume for your review.? Brad will be 
in Houston this summer.? His contact information is given below. 

James Bradley (Brad) Aimone 
6320 Main, Houston, TX? 77005 
713-630-8035 
imaknee@rice.edu 
? 

Also, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.? I sincerely 
hope that you will have the opportunity to discover the contributions Brad 
can make to the Research Group.? I certainly know that he would gain 
tremendously from the experience as I did last summer. 

Thank you very much for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Van

candidate. Please, ask George to send me a resume and we shall get in touch 
with him
to arrange a phone/on-location interview.

Hey Vince,

Given that the Eastern Finance Conference is already taking place, I think
it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round
table discussion.  However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially
having been on such a round table discussion.

I've been teaching a "real options" course that has the students performing
monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along
with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your
new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course.
However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is
particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option
pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually
figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.

This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented
themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you
and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you
recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?

His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would
preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is
George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a
potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a
particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.

Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too
much.

Jinbaek,

The answer to the 1st question is yes.
The project list is fine with me and is still valid. We are an organization
driven by the needs of our internal customers.

I shall froward your message to the  person in EBS.
Hopefully, we shall get a positive response.

Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:
There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
in e-marketplace payment initiative,
where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players
along with Citibank.
He asked me whether you can contact a person at
ENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.
He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON
to see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.

Here is a link to news related to the initiative,

http://www.internetweek.com/story/INW20000808S0001

Fourth:
My advisor wants to know whether
there could be any opportunity to do a case study,
regarding ENRON's business.
He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.
Business model and System architecture...

Thanks for reading this long email.
I'll look forward to your answer..
I am sorry for giving you so much burden
to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

Dear Mr. Kaminski,
 
I was one of the participants of the SIAM Conference which was held last week-end, and I have very much enjoyed your presentation. At the end of the session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e-mail a copy of your talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e-mail address.
 
I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University and I will be graduating this August. I am very much interested in working in the modeling of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your research group.
 
Thank you for your time.
 
Sincerely

Dear Dr. Kaminsky:

I want to thank you for interviewing me last Friday and inviting me back for 
a follow-up interview. It was a pleasure to meet you and other members of 
your staff. 

My interest in working for Enron Research was strengthened as a result of the 
interview. I was most impressed by the quality and diversity of talents 
within your group. My proficiency in probabilistic analysis and experience in 
engineering and financial risk management fit nicely with the activities of 
your group. I have a demonstrated ability to adapt my skills with changing 
business needs. As a member of Shell Research, I supported internal clients 
from different business units. I am confident that I could make a significant 
contribution to your organization over time. 

I want to reiterate my strong interest in working with you and your staff. 
You provide the kind of opportunity I seek. I look forward to seeing you 
again on my follow-up interview next week. Again, thank you for the interview 
and your consideration.

Sincerely,

Rabi S. De

Elizabeth,

I would like to bring this guy in, not necessarily to hire him,
though it's a possibility, but mostly to find out what Cinergy is doing.
We should include some power traders and originators in the interview list.
Grant Masson can give you some hints.

As you may know, we are trying to schedule an interview for Alex Tartakovski 
in Houston this week.  I am copying everyone involved because i wont be able 
to coordinate this tomorrow.  we just brought our new daughter home today and 
my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office.

I just found out that Thursday & Friday are bad days for him, so Wednesday is 
the only day to do it this week.  he would come down tuesday night and fly 
out wednesday evening.  it's probably easiest for him to arrange his flight, 
but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport.  i gave him 
donna's phone number for help. i assume the hyatt would be best.  his home 
number is 215-702-3705 and during the day his cellular is 267-981-5425.

by way of background, i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to 
fill in some of the "vacants" in my group's org chart.  the 3 areas of 
specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are (1) 
coordination of origination, (2) deal pricing and underwriting, and (3) 
modeling and portfolio management.  alex is the perfect person for #3.  he 
has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at 
building analysis models, which will be a big job in this business because 
portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness 
of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating 
these risks.  development of pricing models will be a joint effort between 
"my" group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the 
expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are 
being structured.  i want to encourage joint work between vasant / amitava 
and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research.  
over the past 2 years, alex and i spent a lot of time developing new 
electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels.  i 
would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well, and so 
i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible.  (this could 
possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time - 
(?))  depending on what work needs to be done in the future, i could see him 
working both on pricing research and this specific business unit.

i have attached alex's resume.  i assume he would be manager level, but i'm 
not sure of this.  
this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume, but the skills that are 
useful to us are:
probability / statistical model development
development of theoretical pricing methodology
excellent computer programming skills
database development and data analysis
he has the best understanding of the NERC reliability data format outside of 
Mike Curley, the NERC data manager.
designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by Ace Power Products 
for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt.
excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to 
hedging insurance portfolios.
if you want to get into superconductor trading, he can design the standards.
can beat me at Atari Battlezone (as well as being able to navigate a real 
tank through a minefield).

one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with 
the organization (with which you did such a good job for me) and to give him 
confidence that he will be able to do state-of-the-art pricing research in 
the most innovative company in the world.  he is also interviewing for a job 
in morgan stanley's equity dept.

we will also arrange a meeting with Per in NY, but i would like to be in the 
office for that, so we can do that next week.

please call me @610-996-2522 if there are any questions.  i may not pick up 
but i will reply to voicemail promptly. i'm up 24 hours this week anyway.

thanks,

-- Dave

Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
I was one of the participants of the SIAM Conference which was held last 
week-end, and I have very much enjoyed your presentation. At the end of the 
session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already 
gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e-mail a copy of your 
talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e-mail address.
?
I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University and I will be 
graduating this August. I am very much interested in working in the modeling 
of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and 
who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your 
research group.
?
Thank you for your time.

Sincerely

??? Dear Vince:
?
??? I have put together a list of  finance working papers (some of which I 
brought to the interview last wednesday)  which I have written since 1995 
mostly in support of my work but also (at least  initially) as a learning 
tool. Several of them, however,?do contain  innovations.
??? 
??? I have asked Ms. De Claris to  forward a copy to you.
?
??? As I expressed to you earlier I  am particularly interested in Enron 
Credit Swaps trading platform and the  business opportunities that it will 
spawn.
?
??? I also think that there are  tremendous opportunities to be explored in 
the secondary mortgage maket in the  US. I do not know if Enron has 
considered or is active in this market. This  would be an area that I am also 
very interested and in which I think much better  can be done than most of 
the players in the street.
?
??? The question in my mind  (hopefully not prematurely)?is: If there is 
interest here would Enron  consider letting me put together this business?
?
??? I look forward to hearing from  you soon.
?
??? Best regards
?
??? Joao

Dr. Kaminski

How are you?
The process for starting summer work is going well,
and there will be no problem we start work
on May 30.
I got a place to live, and reserved a flight.
I'm going to leave for Houston on May 29
(expected time to arrival is around noon)
I am very much excited to have opportunity
to join the project making an exchange platform.

I think it's time I'd better remind you
of scheduling a meeting with me,
sometime on May 30.

I hope you let me know what to to
after I arrive at Houston.
And please let me know if you have anything
you think I prepare, to get better outcome
from the summer work.
If you give me a brief on the work,
it would be a great help for me to decide
which material I should carry from here to Houston.

I look forward to the date we meet,
Warm regards,

Jinbaek

Hi Vince,

Thank you for your offer to bring Jacob back for another interview.  Yes, if it is not too much trouble, I would like to talk with him.  I was sorry I had to be out of town last week when he was in the office.  Thanks, just let me know when you would like me to be available.

This is a letter from one of the job applicants who works for PROS.
It seems that the system they develop for Williams
is more a scheduling system.

Would you like to ask him to come back for another interview,
to get more information out of him?

Dear Vince:

It was so nice meeting and talking with you too. I did
not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in
Enron.

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I
have been working two years as Lead Scientist and
Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue
Management Inc. in Houston.

I developed and implemented the mathematical models
for Trading Optimization System and Firm
Transportation Optimization System.

The Trading Optimization System becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the
contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years.

Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management. I am
confident that I can make significant contributions to
Enron in this area.

I would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
Enron.

Sincerely Yours


Jacob

I spoke with Karthik this morning about our offer, and answered some 
additional questions that he had.  He has accepted our offer, but with one 
additional request.  He would now like for us to ship his car.  I asked him 
why he couldn't drive it down here, and he said that it was too old.   I am 
going to check with Relocation for an approximate cost and will get back to 
you....

Thanks,

Dear Ms. Crenshaw:

I recently accepted a quant position with Texaco in Houston.  Lara Berry
from Enron contacted me just after that, and I told her of the situation.
I agreed to send her my resume (which I did) and keep in touch.

Enron is a fabulous corporation with exciting opportunities.  Mr. Kaminski
is very well known in the energy field, and I have read some of his
material.  I am extremely pleased that you all would be interested in me;
however, I have given my word to Texaco.

The Texaco position offers a lot of opportunity and risk.  This is the kind
of challenge for which I am looking.  If things do not work out, however, I
would definitely contact Enron again and cherish any opportunity for an
interview.

Thank you very much,

Cliff Parsons

Hi again,

I am visiting several family members and friends over the next few days.
Therefore it will be hard to contact me.

However, next week I will be easier to reach.  My contact details in NYC are
as follows. I will be staying at the following hotels:

Washington Square Hotel
from November 28th for 3 nights (Tue, Wed and Thur)
212.777.9515

Marriott NYC Financial
December 1st for 1 night (Fri)
212.385.4900


At any rate, I will still try to reach you on tomorrow morning.  If all
fails, we will try to reach each other next week.

Happy Thanksgiving,
Iris

Thanks for the update, Vince.   I have been trying to discuss this with you 
for several days, but I know that you have been very busy.   Jaesoo told me 
that he wanted a base of $90K rather than the $85K which you had authorized 
me to offer him, and I told him that I would have to discuss it with you and 
get back to him.   I am glad that he has seen his way a little more clearly, 
and I will call him tomorrow to finalize the offer.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

First of all, I would like to thank you for the offer from the Enron.
I really appreciate it.

Molly and I talked about the salary the other day, but to be honest with you,
I'm pleased with the possibility that I can work there where I want to work
and the salary is the next.
If this matter bothers you, please ignore it. I can accept the original offer.

I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo

Dear Shirley,

Thanks for your letter and invitation. Next week we have a spring break at
UH, so I will be pretty flexible. Is next Tuesday fine? Almost any time. If
not, any other day next week will work for me. Starting March 19 I will
teach again, and it will be harder (but not impossible) to find a good time
for interview with Enron.

Shane,

Monday would work for us.

My assistant will contact you Wednesday to arrange the interviews.

Dr. Kaminski:
?
I just wanted to touch base and see if I needed to snail mail  a copy of my 
resume or get in touch with anyone else over at Enron.?  
?
The finance department at LSU will be sending out financial  award letters to 
new Ph.D. students before long, and my interning at Enron would  free up some 
additional departmental funds.? In addition, If I will be here  in Baton 
Rouge during the fall, I will need to pay my tuition next month.?  I am able 
to pursue an internship in large part because of the department's  
cooperation and assurance that when I return I will still have a research and 
or  teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of Ph.D.? I have been  
told that such cooperation and assurances are rare at LSU, so I am trying to  
rock the boat as little as possible.
?
I realize until I receive an offer from Enron my internship (I  say 
internship rather than sabbatical because LSU will not continue to pay me my  
stipend while I am away) is not assured until an offer has been extended by  
Enron.? I understand that there are procedures?and protocols that must  be 
followed before this occurs, and I would be willing to do whatever is  
necessary to move to the next step in that process.
?
I will be in Houston on July 8 & 9 for my wife's  grandmother's 80th 
birthday.? If it would be convenient, I could be in  town?on the preceding 
Friday, or following Monday for a visit and/or  interview.? If not, given the 
relatively close proximity between Baton  Rouge and Houston, I would be happy 
to come at another time.
?
Thanks again,
Shane Green
?

Kevin Kindall   3:30 PM

Same scenario - upon arrival in the lobby go to the security desk and ask

Thanks so much for your flexibility!

Sure, tomorrow is fine with me.  Is it possible to schedule it at 3:30 PM?

And I am sure it is not an easy task to fit the schedule of several people to
be available at the same time window.  So please feel free to let me know if
you will need to do another time adjustment.

Please do not think we are always this unorganized, but things just seem
to be happening right now and it is disrupting everyone's schedule.

Would you possibly be able to come tomorrow the 8th?  Kevin Kindall
will not be here on the 15th and he would definately like to interview you.
Then Vince Kaminski will be gone for two weeks after the 15th.  It seems
like tomorrow might be the best time for everyone, if it is for you.

We can begin the interviews at 3:00 PM and probably end them at 5:00
or 5:30 pm.

Please let me know.

Thanks so much for your understanding.

Definitely - any of these days sound good to me.  The only concern that I
have, is that I have my graduate class on Thursday night at 6 PM which is
September the 14th.
So if you will schedule the interview on the 14th of September, I would
need
to leave around 5:15 PM so I could attend  my  class.

It actually might be more convenient for me to meet with the interviewers
on
the 15th of September.  If this day does not fit the schedule of any of the
interested in interviewing individuals, I surely will be able to meet with
them on the 14th.

I will be looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

Valeria Stone

Would you be able to do the interview on the 14th or 15th instead of the
13th?  Vince Kaminski, who would really like to interview you, has been
called out of town on the 13th.  He will be back on the 14th.

Also Grant Masson is conducting an Options Seminar on the 13th and
would not be able to interview you until after 5:00 PM.

Please let me know if we can just push the interview to the same time
frame only on the 14th or 15th.

Thanks!

Dear?Vincent Kaminski:
?
I got your contact details from the  web site for power marketers. I have a 
strong interest in pursuing a career in  the energy industry?with a top 
energy company like?Enron, where my  abilities and qualifications can be 
fully applied for our mutual benefit.  

I am graduating in May with an  MBA?degree with concentrations in finance and 
information systems. This  summer I worked?as an intern with Structuring and 
Analytics group of Ameren  Energy.?This internship?has been especially  
challenging and has enhanced my professional competencies. While there, I  
was afforded the opportunity to?develop a forward view  model?for?off-
peak?electricity price forecasting and analyze the  data sets of a 
fundamental?model to create forward price curves. Both  projects added value 
to the company and provided me with first-hand experience  in the area of 
energy trading and marketing as well as modeling  techniques.

In addition, I have an undergraduate degree in Mechanical  Engineering and 
two years' experience in power generating. With my work  experience in energy 
finance and exceptional academic and professional  achievements, along with 
my exemplary leadership and management potential and  outstanding analytical, 
business communication, problem-solving and computer  skills, I'm convinced 
that I will be able to make immediate contributions to  your company. 

I am attaching my resume for your review. Should you have  any questions or 
need clarification, please feel free to contact me at (504)  861-9110 or 
qchen1@tulane.edu.

As I have some offers with deadlines  approaching, I would appreciate it if 
you could give me a quick response. I also  expect?a base compensation above 
$75k. I look forward to?hearing from  you soon.

=======================================
Vince:
I talked to this guy briefly.  I think he is desparate to get out of Unocal 
before they downsize him out of a job.
He has a decent resume and the attached comment from Don Winslow is 
interesting.

Grant.

=======================================
Grant - here's the resume of the guy that called.  Sorry for the delay.  Here 
are Don Winslow's comments:

"Greg was my predecessor in the risk mgt dept at Unocal. He reminds me
somewhat of Remi's cousin-mild mannered, Physics Phd.  He is brilliant and
expresses himself well.  I think he might fit in Vince's group better than
in your group.  He has not had much exposure to commercial transactions. He
was in Bill Bradford's MBA class.  He graduated #1."

Vince,
Jacob has good background in OR and can start working on
pipeline problems right away, if we need someone. 

Maybe it is from his consulting background, I found that at times
he exaggerates a bit about his roles in model building. He would 
start saying he did everything, and later water it down quite a bit.
(What he actually did is not an easy accomplishment though.) 
He also stressed that he wants to move away from pipeline 
projects.

I did not got a chance to ask him any questions about derivatives
and finance. 

Best,
Alex

Hello Kenneth:

Nice talking to you this morning!  Below is your interview schedule for
Monday, Oct. 30th and directions to the Enron Bldg..  Please let me know 
if you need any travel arrangements made.

Coming from the northwest part of Houston, your best bet would be to 
take I-45 into town.  There is quite a bit of construction downtown, so you 
will probably have to take the McKinney exit from I-45 (you will need to 
stay in the left lane as you approach town.  Exit McKinney to Smith Street, 
take a right on Smith Street go to Andrews Street, take a right on Andrews 
(the Enron bldg. is on the left), pass the Enron Bldg. cross "Ruthvan" (1st 
stop sign) and pull into the Allen Center Parking garage (Visitors area on 
your right).  Come to the security desk on the 1st floor of the Enron Bldg. 
and ask for me.  They will call me and I will meet you in the elevator lobby 
on the 19th floor. 

Monday, October 30th

9:00 AM  Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research
9:30 AM  Zimin Lu, Director
10:00 AM Vasant, Vice President
10:30 AM Krishna Krishnarao, Director
11:00 AM Paulo Issler, Manager
11:30 AM Stinson Gibner (He will take you to lunch)
1:00 PM  Molly McGee (HR Recruiter)

Have a safe trip.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw

Dear Vince:
?
I am in a somewhat delicate position. One of the  people in the group here 
has asked me to introduce him to you.? As an El  Paso vice president, I 
should not have agreed to do this, and frankly, the guy  should not have 
asked.? But he is clearly very unhappy at El Paso, so, as a  human being, I 
felt it was appropriate. Also, because this guy would have  contacted you 
anyway, with or without my introduction, as a professional  courtesy, I would 
like you to benefit from my experience with this  fellow.
?
The guy's name is Joao Neves (Portugese).? I  think he is reasonably bright 
and seems to have a quite deep understanding of  general finance and 
financial mathematics. He is a manager and feels very  frustrated because he 
had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority.  Instead the group's 
M.D. brought in two Price-Waterhouse-Coopers consultants as  V.P's to run the 
structuring and quant sides of the group. In this respect, I  can understand 
his unhappiness. Unfortunately for him, however, I also think it  is in his 
nature to whine.? I have observed him to bad mouth lots of people  starting 
with the IT guys (ok, that's perhaps not much an indictment!) all the  way to 
dismissing Broadie & Glasserman's or Eduardo Schwartz' works as  shoddy or 
shallow.? He does not seem to suffer well people he considers  fools.? Caveat 
Emptor, therefore! Having said all this, I do want to  emphasize that he is a 
bright guy, is very pleasant with me, and, perhaps given  the appropriate 
environment and supervision, might be quite productive.?  But don't take my 
word for it. Talk to him, and see what you think.?  Obviously, I would ask 
that you keep these comments in confidence. I have given  you an honest 
assessment -- brutally so.
?
'Nuff said! I have fulfilled my moral obligations  both to Joao and to you.
?
Best Regards,
Grant.

Hi Vince,

This candidate was forwarded from the Norway office.  He is finishing his PhD 
in Cambridge but is available soon.  If you are free on Thursday before the 
regular weekly meeting that would be good - would 3pm or 4pm work for you 
(9am or 10am your time) to set up the video interview?

Dear Vince:

How are you? Thanks for coordinating an offer for me.

As I told Stinson early this week, I understand that
it is a little bit tricky for Enron in term of my
starting date. To be honest, I am very flexible
myself, it really depends on Enron. If you want me to
start right now, then I would expect Enron to
compensate for my this year's bonus. In this case, it
is not quite fair for Enron, since now we are already
at the end of October.

Another option is that we can work out an offer right
now, and I can start my new job right after I get my
bonus from Williams, which should be in the very
beginning of February. This choice is perfectly fine
with me. Actually it might be even a little better for
me since Williams has had very good year this year.

Vince, I just want to tell you that I am very
interested in your group, and very excited about this
opportunity. If you have any questions, please feel
free to call me at 918-409-4308.

sincerely,
Charles

Celeste,

I attach some brief job candidate descriptions for the types of people we are 
looking for at the BS/MS level.




Osman Sezgen (supporting EES)  and P.V. Krishnarao (supporting EES, EBS, and 
GPG) both said that they are willing to help in interviewing, recruiting, or 
reviewing resumes.    I also would make myself available (EBS, ENA)  and 
would be especially willing to help at the schools I attended,  Caltech and 
Rice (both on your target list).

Let us know what we can do to help.

Best regards,

--Stinson

Dear Kevin:

Dr. Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Zimin Lu will interview you at the same time
in a group interview, which will last approximately 1 hour.

If it meets with your approval, I have scheduled the telephone interview for 
this Friday, August 4 at 1:00 PM.  They will call you at 713-630-0768.

FYI.  The Research Group is responsible for option modeling, building systems 
for risk quantification and management, development of optimization systems, 
assisting with statistical analysis and anything that requires advanced math, 
for
all of Enron.

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Dear Shirley,

Sorry for getting back with you until today. I have been out of town since
last Friday and didn't have access to emails.

I appreciate the opportunities to talk with Mr. Kaminski, Mr. Gibner, and
Mr. Lu and look forward to their phone calls.  As to the date and time, I
will be available all day this Friday and any day next week. Please let me
know when they will be available so that I can arrange schedule to
accommodate.  I can be reached at 713-630-0768.

Also, I have a couple of questions that I hope to get your help:

1. Will the interview be a group interview or each of them will talk with me
individually?

2. What's the role of the Research Group at Enron?

Thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you.


Kevin Xu

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

As explained over the phone, I have been doing political, economic, and 
strategic analysis for Terry Thorn, formerly head of government affairs for 
EI. Most of my work has been focussed on Asia, a region in which I have deep 
experience and speak major languages. Wtih the restructuring of the 
Asia-Pacific group, Terry is moving to a new function and I am seeking a new 
role. Since I have been based in Washington, DC, with more frequent trips to 
Asia than to Houston, I still feel as though I don't know my way around the 
company, a disadvantage in my current situation. Several people have 
recommended that I talk to you about your shop, but more generally if you 
have any ideas about where I might fit in, I would appreciate them.

I am attaching my resume, cv and a biographical sketch as you requested,

Edith Terry
Enron/DC

I have found the EnronOnline project a very interesting one and have enjoyed
working with everyone in the Research department as well as those from other
departments. I am keenly interested in this area and was wondering if there
would be any summer internship opportunities. I have attached my resume to

Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
Even though I cannot pass "official" interviews, I  would like to discuss 
with ENRON. I was really impressed by your presentation  and I think I would 
be a good fit for your firm.
?
I know that you?will be soon recruiting on  campus, maybe we could set up an 
"informal meeting". Either give me a call at  home (412-802-6429) or send me 
an email at this address. I would appreciate  though not to appear on 
interview lists.

Dear?Vincent Kaminski:
?
I got your contact details from the  web site for power marketers. I have a 
strong interest in pursuing a career in  the energy industry?with a top 
energy company like?Enron, where my  abilities and qualifications can be 
fully applied for our mutual benefit.  

I am graduating in May with an  MBA?degree with concentrations in finance and 
information systems. This  summer I worked?as an intern with Structuring and 
Analytics group of Ameren  Energy.?This internship?has been especially  
challenging and has enhanced my professional competencies. While there, I  
was afforded the opportunity to?develop a forward view  model?for?off-
peak?electricity price forecasting and analyze the  data sets of a 
fundamental?model to create forward price curves. Both  projects added value 
to the company and provided me with first-hand experience  in the area of 
energy trading and marketing as well as modeling  techniques.

In addition, I have an undergraduate degree in Mechanical  Engineering and 
two years' experience in power generating. With my work  experience in energy 
finance and exceptional academic and professional  achievements, along with 
my exemplary leadership and management potential and  outstanding analytical, 
business communication, problem-solving and computer  skills, I'm convinced 
that I will be able to make immediate contributions to  your company. 

I am attaching my resume for your review. Should you have  any questions or 
need clarification, please feel free to contact me at (504)  861-9110 or 
qchen1@tulane.edu.

As I have some offers with deadlines  approaching, I would appreciate it if 
you could give me a quick response. I also  expect?a base compensation above 
$75k. I look forward to?hearing from  you soon.

Molly,

Below are the resumes sent to us by Focus.   Vince suggested that we 
interview one person plus Sriram, who already lives in Houston.   Karim looks 
like the most qualified, but my fear is that we may not be able to afford 
him.   I am assuming that Vince will want to hire at most at the manager 
level.   Can you first check and see if Karim would consider coming at a 
manager level salary before we spend time talking with him.   If he is too 
senior, then we should talk to Samir, who looks like a more junior level 
person.

Thanks,

Stinson

Guys

I'm out of the office until Wednesday next week.  I'll chase you up for 
feedback on your video interview with Thomas next week (if I don't get any 
from Grant before then).

I thought I'd better clear up the fact that you're the only Research people 
(except me) to have spoken to Thomas so far.  Although Vince agrees that he's 
a strong candidate, Anjam was strongly opposed to Thomas's being brought in 
for interview.  I thought last night's video interview was a reasonable way 
to get an objective view from other Research guys.

Cheers,
Steve

Toni,

I would like to bring two people for an interview 

One of them sent me a message that is attached below.
I am including the info about the 2nd gentleman below.

I would like to include myself, Vasant Shnabhogue, Tanya Tamarchenko
Stinson Gibner, Zimin Lu, Paulo Issler,  Alex Tang on the interview list.

It would be great if we could bring them this week on Friday. Tanya
will be at a training course next week. This means that if Friday this week 
is too aggressive,
we should shoot for interviews in 2 weeks.

Sorry for a short notice.

Dear Vince:

How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After
having been working for Williams for about two years,
now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a
great company, I am wondering whether there is any
opportunity for me, either in research group or in
structure group

Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
and in charge of the quantitative research group with
7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
research and modeling about electricity,
load-following deal and tolling deals.

If you need any additional information, please feel
free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
hearing from you soon, thank you.

sincerely,
Charles

Jinbaek,

May 30 sounds good. I shall inform our HR department.

I don't see any project I could get going with your advisor on such a short
notice.

When you come here you can determine in what area he could make
the biggest contribution to Enron. I shall call or E-mail
him independently and talk to him.

Vince

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek

Hi Vince,

This resume looks quite good.  We may wish to talk to him on the phone.  
However, now that David Hoog has hired his own actuarial guys (Alex 
Tartakowski and Larry Markus) from Ace, I am not sure if they require support 
on the actuarial side.  With Don Black (of Global Risk Markets) leaving 
Enron, I think the effort to develop power products for the insurance markets 
is pretty much nonexistent, except for David Hoog's product.  The resume 
still looks interesting, though.

Dear Sir/Madam,

 I am a student in a Master's programme in Mathematical Finance due to 
graduate in August. My intention upon graduation is to work in a quantitative 
capacity in the
 Power markets and to this end, I am including my resume  in the hope that I 
might be considered for any available position in your risk
 management or structured products group requiring such mathematical skills.

I have addressed this email to your graduate programmes address but I am 
unsure whether or not my candidacy would fall under the umbrella covered by 
your associate programme. If this is not the case, any help in seeing that my 
resume finds the correct destination would be greatly appreciated.

 Yours sincerely,


 Ian McCracken

Good afternoon Mike:

I certainly am interested in determining if there may be a potential fit
there at Enron.  I am very enthusiastic to apply my finance and meteorology
backgrounds in a market-based environment that is driven to achieve
unprecedented efficiencies.  Attached are two documents:  1) a
business-focused resume, and 2) an abbreviated Meteorology CV.

Graduate Meteorology coursework included Advanced Atmospheric Dynamics I and
II, Advanced Physical Meteorology, Boundary Layer Modeling, Numerical
Modeling, Research Methods in Meteorology, and Turbulence.

I will look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Greg Hunt

It seems that the system they develop for Williams

Dear Vince:

It was so nice meeting and talking with you too. I did
not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in
Enron.

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I
have been working two years as Lead Scientist and
Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue
Management Inc. in Houston.

I developed and implemented the mathematical models
for Trading Optimization System and Firm
Transportation Optimization System.

The Trading Optimization System becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the
contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years.

Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management. I am
confident that I can make significant contributions to
Enron in this area.

I would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
Enron.

Sincerely Yours


Jacob

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee.

Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing
analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++
programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron.

My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in
this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

Teresa,

I would like to invite Iris for an interview in Houston.
She works currently in London Can you call her
and ask when she is planning to visit the States.
We could pay the airfare from a location in the States.

I would hate to pay the 1st class ticket from London to Houston,
though I would go for it, if necessary (I don't
want a candidate to think that we are that cheap).
Business class is a standard
for business related, cross-Atlantic flights. 

I would be more comfortable if you could negotiate this issue.

Thanks 

Vince

responded
sooner.

     Currently I am working in Derivatives Structured Products and Risk
Management at BNP Paribas in London.  Although I currently enjoy living and
working in London, I may need to return to the states - because of my
mother's
failing health.

     Do you know of any good contacts at investment banks that I may

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference
in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This
is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
detail?

     Thanks for your time and consideration.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Iris Mack

Hello Ainsley:

We are so glad you are interested!  I spoke with Vince Kaminski and the
procedure is to usually conduct a telephone interview first.  This will let
us know exactly where your interests are and establish where you might
fit within our organization.

Please let me know your availability and the best time to reach you on 
Thursday (the 25th) or Friday (the 26th) afternoon from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. 

Also please let me have the telephone number where you may reached
and we will call you.  It is easier that way since there will be several of
us involved in the interview.  The interview will usually last an hour or an
hour and a half.

Thank you Ainsley!

Sincerely,

Shirley Crenshaw

I spoke with Karthik this morning about our offer, and answered some additional questions that he had.  He has accepted our offer, but with one additional request.  He would now like for us to ship his car.  I asked him why he couldn't drive it down here, and he said that it was too old.   I am going to check with Relocation for an approximate cost and will get back to you....

Thanks,

Hi Vince,
` this person was recommended by Prof. MacMinn, and he is interested.  
He seems to have the quantitative and insurance background.  I am going to 
call him again.  
Would you like to talk with him on the phone?

Vasant,

I enjoyed our telephone conversation this morning.  From our conversation,
it sounds like Enron is moving out on the cutting edge of risk transfer and
insurance finance.  In my mind, there seem to be a myriad number of
interesting opportunities moving forward.  As well, I see a number of issues
that would need to be resolved.  Frankly, I find that quite exciting.  I
left academics largely because I wanted to move into a more "front line"
career. While I've enjoyed my work here at the NAIC, it is still not where I
ultimately see myself.  I gathered from your comments some concern about my
being too senior in the organization.  If I am interpreting you correctly,
you are concerned about hands on technical work.  I enjoy that immensely and
some of the strengths I bring to the table are the ability to think
creatively about solving financial problems and the the ability to make data
tell the underlying story.

I look forward to talking to you next week.  I just found out that our
office building will be closed Monday, so I will not be in until Tuesday
a.m.

We have two options. Kevin will be interviewing in mid-December in Pittsburgh 
and  he
can talk to you  you or we can invite you to Houston.

What are you interested in? A quant position or a trading job?  Our trading

are looking for people with trading experience.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
Even though I cannot pass "official" interviews, I  would like to discuss 
with ENRON. I was really impressed by your presentation  and I think I would 
be a good fit for your firm.
?
I know that you?will be soon recruiting on  campus, maybe we could set up an 
"informal meeting". Either give me a call at  home (412-802-6429) or send me 
an email at this address. I would appreciate  though not to appear on 
interview lists.

Ms. Crenshaw,

 Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the
opportunity to talk to personnel from the Research Group at Enron. Between
the two days you suggest, I prefer Wednesday 12/6. Considering the
two-hour time difference between California and Texas, 11:00 am Pacific
time (1:00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most
of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end,
please let me know.

 Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your
colleagues.

for your group, this should be your call.  Let me know if your business unit

Ms. Roberts, thanks for the quick reply! I received the offer on Thursday, 
and I
am very excited about joining Enron this summer. My research group is
establishing a long term collaboration with Dr. Kaminski and Dr. Gibner, and I
hope to help foster this relationship this summer.
I would just like to discuss one issue that is very specific to my status of
international student. As an international student, I am required to enroll 
part
time at Stanford University during the summer quarter in order to be 
considered
eligible for a summer internship ("optional practical training"). The cost of
the part-time tuition will be approx. $2300 for this academic year. The past
summer, my employer (AT&T) matched this tuition cost in an effort not to
discriminate between international and domestic Ph.D. students. The offers for
summer employment I received this year have also been very flexible in this
respect. I would like to know if Enron could do the same; it would be of 
course
very much appreciated (given the notoriously precarious financial condition of
Ph.D. students). Yet, to make things clear, please rest assured that my
acceptance of your offer is not conditioned on your reply regarding this 
issue,
and that I intend to be at Enron this summer.
All the best,

          Giuseppe

Stinson,

I have accepted an amended offer from Southern Company Energy
Marketing.  My decision was based on the higher compensation, and the
opportunity to rotate through structuring, trading and research.  I am
very confident that I would have been very engaged and happy working in
your group; I did not take the decision lightly.

I'll be moving to Atlanta in March, but I will keep the email and URL

Dear Vince,

I am writing to bring to your attention a GSIA student, John Gordon, who is
currently being considered for Enron's Associates program.  My understanding
is that Mark Courtney and Andrew Miles at Enron are championing John as a
late addition to the program.

While I know Enron doesn't routinely recruit at GSIA, John would be an ideal
candidate if you are willing to make an exception.  He is a terrific finance
student with a strong transcript; including an A+ in my Options class. Since
John has an engineering/energy background, he asked early on for additional
background reading about finance and energy.  John is personable and
outgoing.  Normally the job market for someone of John's caliber would have
already cleared, but I have been told that there are dual career issues at
play here.

I would be very appreciative if you would take a look at John.  A copy of
his resume is attached to this email.

Best regards,
Duane

Charlene,

Thank you for accomodating our request to start Charlie Weldon in his 
rotation in the Research Group earlier than the incoming Associate official 
start date of August 7th.

As we discussed, the business purpose for this request is related to the 
project we have earmarked for him, which is linked to the hurricane season, 
which starts in June.

And you have my e-handshake that we will release him to participate in the 
regularly organized orientation activities scheduled for August.

We expect he will report on Wednesday, June 21st.

Thanks again,

Vince,
See below for my picks based on the resumes.   The others marked as "no" 
might be OK as well, but did not seem to have as much slant towards finance.

Dear Molly,

I asked about change of the departure city.  They said I should send my ticket
back to get a new ticket. Since Aquila provides the ticket, it's hard for me
to change the departing place. If possible, can I ask you to arrange the one
way flight from Houston to Seattle on the evening of 25th?  I'm sorry for
this.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

Vince:  Tony Vasut, another recruiter, is bringing Mark Boland in for a 
series of interviews on 3/20 and 3/21, and asked if there was any chance that 
you or someone in your group would be able to interview him.   His resume is 
attached, and I will also send you a list of his deals under separate 
cover.    Shirley has told me that you will be in and out for the next 
several weeks, so if you are unavailable would you please suggest someone 
else in your group who might be able to interview Mark?

Thanks, as always,
Molly

I think we should  invite Bruce for additional interviews. I think that he 
does not have 
the skills required in my unit, but he could contribute in other areas.

Here is the list of potential interviewees:

Charlene Jackson, Managing Director of the Associate and Analyst Program.  =
I=20
wanted to follow up with a note to all campus team MDs and IT team members =
to=20
clarify any confusion surrounding Super Saturdays and technologist recruiti=

for the Global Technology Track.   Although the Global Technology Track is=
=20
part of the Analyst and Associate Program - we will NOT be participating in=
=20
the Super Saturday events listed below.  Technologist candidates will be=20
brought into the office for a FRIDAY office visit. =20

Super Saturdays were first initiated for commercial Analyst and Associate=
=20
recruiting because many Enron representatives were not able to leave their=
=20
desks while the market was open during the workday.  Bringing candidates in=
=20
during the weekend works well in this situation because Enron representativ=
es=20
can fully participate in the office visit and candidates can still see the=
=20
office.

However, many technology VPs have suggested that seeing Enron "alive and in=
=20
action" during the week would be a high selling point for technologist=20
candidates.    Therefore, we have opted to have Technology office visits on=
=20
Fridays.  The first three office visits are listed below:

November 10th
December 1st
January 19th

We will be sending out more detailed information on how you can become more=

involved with technology office visits.  I apologize for any confusion. =20
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments. 3-3589.

Subject: Super Saturday Changes

The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weeke=
nd=20
is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous=20
interview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on =01&selling=01=
8=20
candidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.  Students will=
=20
arrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.  We have=20
activities planned for the entire weekend.  The goal is to implement a Supe=
r=20
Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions=
=20
while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20
employees.  To that end, we have made the following changes:
Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =
 =20
We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to hav=
e=20
small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=
nd=20
four (4) students.  There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant=
=20
before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua=
te=20
more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages=
=20
(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will=20
facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We=
=20
have allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To=20
facilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the=20
interviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students wil=
l=20
rotate.=20
In prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates. =20
Interviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.  The remainder of=
=20
the time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that=
=20
all interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation=
=20
forms are completed and input prior to the meeting.=20
Decision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on=
=20
Monday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday=20
following the interviews and lunch.  The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 P=
M=20
to 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron=01,s executive manag=

???????  
?
??? ??? Dear  Vince:
?
??? ??? Thank you for  the invitation yesterday. It was a pleasure to meet 
you all and learn more about  the group, it's structure and to some extent 
what you are involved in. Please  extend my thanks to all of them.
?
??? ??? I am  particularly interested in the Credit Swap trading platform 
that Enron has  recently started. Such a platform will provide unique 
visibility into the Credit  markets. As you suggested I tried to learn more 
about this from Tanya.?I  would like to learn more and if possible meet other 
people more directly linked  to the effort.
?
??? ??? Just simple  instruments like Credit Swaps will require serious 
modelling capability for the  pricing and the hedging of these apparently 
simple intruments. The market  visibility I mention above can be explored 
through Credit Derivatives Trading  successfully if Enron possesses superior 
(vis a vis Morgan Stanley, Salomon  Smith Barney, Chase Manhatan, 
etc.)?modelling technology in Credit  Derivatives. I can and would like 
to?consider the possibility of doing this  for Enron. I would like to help 
develop and participate in putting together that  business.
?
??? ??? As I  mentioned to you I have done some work in Credit Derivatives 
and am deeply  familiar with virtually all the work of the principal 
academics in Credit  Derivatives namely: Duffie, Lando, Tuffano, Duffee, Das, 
Lelland, etc. I have  read carefully most of their work (published as well as 
working papers) on the  subject to date.
?
??? ??? I look  forward to hearing from you.

??? ??? Best  regards

Scott,

I spoke briefly with Edith Terry from our DC office. There is not a good fit 
for my group
but she could be a great asset for you.

I have her resume in case you are hiring and  would like to take a look at 
her.

Vince,

Alex and I did a phone interview with Bill Koures.

He works for Williams and had a Wall street background.
He is very qualified for the work we are doing here (stochastic modeling, 
curve building, option valuation,etc.)
He programs in C and Matlab.

In terms of quantitative skills, Bill is better than Ren Zhang (Koch) I 
talked yesterday.     The only down
side Alex and I can think of about Mr. Koures is that we may not get him due 
to a higher price tag.

Vince, congratulations on your promotion.  Hope the litigation lawyers are 
leaving you alone.

I'm attaching a resume of a friend of mine, Cameron Payne.  I don't know if 
you are looking for anyone but Cameron is pretty special, as you'll see from 
his resume.   Call him or me if you're interested in talking to him.  I'm 
forwarding his resume to Fastow and Whalley, too, in case they see a fit.  
Take care.  Bob

Alberto,

We would definitely be interested in talking to you when you get to 
Houston.   I will have our assistant, Shirley Crenshaw, set up some time for 
you to meet with people in our group, which would include myself, Zimin Lu, 
and Vince Kaminski.

Best regards,

Dear Mr. Gibner:

It was very interesting talking to you during Enron's recruiting weekend the 
first week of last December.

I am starting as an Analyst next February and I have alot of interest in real 
options. I have done much of my research in the application of real options 
in the valuation of oil and mining properties using Black-Scholes, Merton , 
Binomial LAttices, etc. I have also done forecast of commodity prices such as 
copper and oil using both, a Geometric Brownian Motion and a Mean Reverting 
Process.

I remember in our conversation you told me that your department is very 
involved with real options so I would like to know if there is an opportunity 
to talk either on the phone or once I am in Houston the first week for the 
orientation. Because I am very interested in working in your department. I 
won't be in Houston until February 6th, but you can reach me at 310 390 7817 
or ajimenez@mines.edu

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Alberto Jimenez

Shawn,

I have met Bogdan a few times socially. He graduated from the same university
I went to in Poland.

He seems to be a dynamic and a personable guy.
He has experience that may be useful to your group.

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with 
Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor 
fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience.  Publications are available on request.

I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email.

Thank you for your time.

        Dear  Tanya:
 
    
        It was a  great pleasure to have met you. I very much enjoyed the interview and your  insightfull questions.
 
        I am keenly  aware that many of the methods that I discussed with you yesterday are unique,  new and not reported elsewhere. This is true both about the work I did in  whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as GARCH. The innovations  stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that I have both in  turbulence physics as well as finance. They entailed considering the problem  from its raw formulation, mathematical analysis, physical interpretation,  taylored numerical method development, software writting and develoment and data  management.
 
        As to why I  have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has  been adding value to the business not publishing. Publishing is however an  option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the  work that I did.
 
        I not however  that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the  mathematics, finance, software design and data managemnet aspects of the  problem. Absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and  execution.
 
        Please recall  that as good as they were the performance measures that I mentioned to you were  for a single processor machine. Vastly better can be achieved with both soft  parallelism (multithreading) as well as hard parallelism (heterogenous network).  This fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used.
 
        In fact I  know for a fact that better can be done than what I mentioned in the interview.  From work that I have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility  surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model ITM and OTM instruments can  be included in both the callibration, pricing and hedging. 
 
        I look  forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us  cooperating.
 
        Best  regards
 
         Joao

Hi Vince,
The following is what I wrote to Molly as she prepares the contract for me to 
work with Enron.
I thank you for allowing me to work with Enron and will do all that I can to 
make you happy with my candiates and performance.
Thank you for you support Vince.
Will check in soon,
Jeff
********************************************************
Sorry about the mix-up on the email Molly.
I hope you get this one.

As most good corporations like Enron have predefined contractual arrangements 
to do Executive Search business I will be happy to abide by your terms and 
rules.
And to be quite honest- Enron is about the "best it gets" so, I prefer to not 
draft a contract this time or for this relationship- I will wait for yours to 
be signed by me.  The only stipulation I request of you is that upon 
contractual performance, Enron Accounts Payable please wire my funds to my 
account as I have a multi-currency account denominated in USD/Canadian or 
British Pounds (which ever fits you as I may need to pay my counterparts in 
the UK)...other than that I have no perplexities.
I will send you my wire instructions later, either my bank in California or 
in Bermuda.
As I live in California and do contingency search, I must go off of my 
client's "good word" on occasion and luckily haven't had any problems so 
far...I always honor California Verbal Contract Law -if I do not draft.
I think you fee payment of 20% is generous and the industry standard of 30 
day guarantee on replacement is fair. Obviously there is no deposit on any 
contingency and if there is a definite urgent need for a position to be 
filled only then will I ask your help for a minor deposit to aid in my 
overhead to shift all my resources to search on behalf on Enron.
As Enron has the in-house power to probably not need this service then 
obviously a deposit will not be required.
If you wish me to send my standard agreement then I will, but you have made 
yourself perfectly clear by phone what you are willing to do. I therefore 
will be happy to receive you contract and follow your instructions.
I thank you and Vince for allowing me to work with Enron and pledge to you my 
best work and candidates utilizing my network of contacts.
I am very excited about our new relationship and hope to give you my very 
best service.
Thank you very much for this opportunity Molly, please send my your contract 
so, that I may sign it and send it right back to you immediately. I am 
looking forward to working with Vince and you.
Thank you again,
Jeff Wesley

Ps- I can utilize to resources of Management recruiters International USA and 
Robert Walters of the UK to aid in my service to you.
Best regards,
Jeff Wesley

Vice:

I interviewed Nelson last week. Here is my feedback:

 1) Very communicative
 2) Good professional experience - works as a consultant
 3) Good quantitative background

He lacks a background in finance, which may be a minus for a position in the 
group. I beleive he may be valuable for other areas that deal with emissions 
and pollutants.

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a 
professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a 
statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken 
would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are

Subject: RE: Resume

Vince,

 he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background (and then some 
credit exposure calculation) with not much credit data analysis experience.  
I do not think he would be appropriate for Bryan's group -- he needs a person 
who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data, and although 
this guy may be good at modeling, we already have Iris and Amitava doing the 
modeling and looking at data.  At this stage, I would prefer to hire somebody 
with direct experience in credit analysis (banking, rating agency).  I am 
worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience, then 
Amitava will find himself with two people (Iris being the other one) who are 
both inexperienced in this area, and he will find himself doing a lot of the 
work anyway.
 If you want to pursue him, we should probably do a phone interview first.

Subject: real options openings?


Dear Vince Kaminski,
 I was auditing Prof Dyer's Real Options class on Thursday when you spoke
on Enron's activities in this area.  I would be interested in exploring the
possibility of joining the group that works on real options in response to
and in anticipation of Enron's business requirements.  I'm currently
working in the development and application of real options methodology at
Schlumberger.  In particular I'll be speaking at an industry Real Options
Valuation conference in London (http://www.iqpc.co.uk/finance/rov/) and I
just had the paper accepted for publication in Operations Research.  Could
you pass my resume on to the relevant people to have a look at?

Thanks in advance,

Chris Kenyon

Good to hear from you!  I think it is a good idea for you to talk to Maureen
Raymond-Castaneda, Enron's Chief Economist or Dr. Vince Kaminski,
Managing Director and Head of Research.   Unfortunately both are out
of the office at present.  Maureen will return on Monday, the 23rd and
Vince will return on Wednesday, the 25th.

If you will be available for a telephone call on Wednesday, the 25th,
please let me know when and the telephone number and I will arrange 
the telephone interview.

Shriley:

I'm terribly sorry it's taking me so long to get back to you.  Because I am
moving to a new office after my trip next week it is difficult to make
definite plans.  Looking at my schedule now I would suggest tentatively
that I could come on Friday November 3.  Again, I would like to reconfirm
with you after I return from Montreal a week from now.

I would also be interested in having a phone conversation with someone
who can tell me in a bit more detail about Enron's research group and this
particular position.  That would be very helpful in preparing to come to
Houston.  Please let me know if this is feasible.

Thanks for your patience.

While we are anxious to fill this position, we certainly understand
scheduling
conflicts!  Please let us know as soon as you have a definate time.

Dr. Kaminski will be out of the office the next two weeks also.  Maybe
the
week

Look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for your message.  Our e-mail system was down all day
yesterday so I was not able to respond until today.

I am very interested in coming in for an interview.  Unfortunately, my
schedule will make traveling on a weekday difficult for at least the next
two weeks.  I am travelling as part of the US delegation to the G-20 on
the 24th and 25th and will be busy until then in preparation.  Immediately
following that trip I will be moving to a new office here in Treasury and
am not sure about my schedule.

I would like to wait until next week when I have a better idea of my
schedule to propose times to come to Houston.  Please let me know if
there are time constraints on your side.

Thanks,

Good morning Mr. Giancola:

Your resume was forwarded to Vince Kaminski, Managing Director and
Head of Research with Enron.

We would like to bring you in for an informal interview at your
convenience.
This would be for a position of "Economist" or "Associate Economist",
reporting to Maureen Raymond Castaneda.

Please give me some dates and times that would be convenient with you

Houston.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Vince- I just got off the phone with RW and Enron London.
Alec told me that Howard is idle and waiting for your command and the 
coordination of the directors.
Melanie is working with Vuthy RW directly on this for you and Rachel Quirk 
said she will contact you to set the time up..."Unofficially" they were 
trying to do something with Howard tomorrow as I was told- not sure.
I have a couple other candidates I would like to send you after I collect 
some sleep ( 3;30 AM now)- I'll send them to you after I wake.
One guy from Oxford, Worked Citibank Fixed Income risk the other over at Ford 
Motor Company who is looking to move to London (highly recommended by the 
professor).
I'll send them later as to let you be the judge.
Talk soon- thanks for the business!

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you very much for meeting with me again today over lunch. I appreciated 
the opportunity to catch up with you.

Please find attached my current resume (both a short and a long version). I 
have worked as a trader, portfolio risk manager, and a stock analyst. I have 
traded derivatives, bonds, and stocks,  and managed insurance and pension 
investment portfolios to maximize risk-adjusted returns.  Let me highlight 
some of my work experiences.

Trading and Risk Management
    a.. Structured, negotiated, and traded OTC interests rate swaps, 
cross-currency swaps, swaptions, and exchange-traded equity index futures and 
options. Made PowerPoint presentations to GARP and the UOH on credit 
derivatives.
    b.. Developed investment hedging program utilizing exchanged-traded bond 
futures and interest rate swaps.
    c.. Traded and managed pension and insurance fixed income portfolios to 
maximize total return and funding ratios. Bonds traded: Treasuries, Agencies, 
MBS/CMOs, ABS, Corporate, Yankees, and Foreign.
    d.. Traded and managed stock mutual portfolios for total return.
    e.. Created a computer program to quantify the attribution of total 
return for fixed income portfolios relative to market returns.
    f.. Programmed investment compliance rules to monitor the management of 
domestic and global stock, bond and money market mutual funds.
    g.. Supervised market risks, credit risks, legal risks, and operations 
risks of derivatives, bonds, money market securities, and equities.
Policy , Reporting and Projects
    a.. Developed investment policy guidelines to manage fixed income 
portfolios.
    b.. Rewrote derivatives policy manual.
    c.. Prepared a 20-page PowerPoint slide presentation on India for the 
senior management.
    d.. Prepared and presented investment reports to CIOs, Investment 
Committees, and Boards of Trustees
I shall, therefore, appreciate your help in connecting me with the right 
individual within Enron for a job interview to work as a financial 
trader/risk manager. I can provide excellent references upon request.

Thank you for the lunch.

Sorry about the mix-up on the email Molly.
I hope you get this one.

As most good corporations like Enron have predefined contractual arrangements 
to do Executive Search business I will be happy to abide by your terms and 
rules.
And to be quite honest- Enron is about the "best it gets" so, I prefer to not 
draft a contract this time or for this relationship- I will wait for yours to 
be signed by me.  The only stipulation I request of you is that upon 
contractual performance, Enron Accounts Payable please wire my funds to my 
account as I have a multi-currency account denominated in USD/Canadian or 
British Pounds (which ever fits you as I may need to pay my counterparts in 
the UK)...other than that I have no perplexities.
I will send you my wire instructions later, either my bank in California or 
in Bermuda.
As I live in California and do contingency search, I must go off of my 
client's "good word" on occasion and luckily haven't had any problems so 
far...I always honor California Verbal Contract Law -if I do not draft.
I think you fee payment of 20% is generous and the industry standard of 30 
day guarantee on replacement is fair. Obviously there is no deposit on any 
contingency and if there is a definite urgent need for a position to be 
filled only then will I ask your help for a minor deposit to aid in my 
overhead to shift all my resources to search on behalf on Enron.
As Enron has the in-house power to probably not need this service then 
obviously a deposit will not be required.
If you wish me to send my standard agreement then I will, but you have made 
yourself perfectly clear by phone what you are willing to do. I therefore 
will be happy to receive you contract and follow your instructions.
I thank you and Vince for allowing me to work with Enron and pledge to you my 
best work and candidates utilizing my network of contacts.
I am very excited about our new relationship and hope to give you my very 
best service.
Thank you very much for this opportunity Molly, please send my your contract 
so, that I may sign it and send it right back to you immediately. I am 
looking forward to working with Vince and you.
Thank you again,
Jeff Wesley

Ps- I can utilize to resources of Management recruiters International USA and 
Robert Walters of the UK to aid in my service to you.
Best regards,
Jeff Wesley

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

I read with interest your company=01,s description on the
Web page. I was highly impressed by the work that
ENRON Corporation does and would like to inquire about
employment opportunities with your company.

Enclosed is a copy of my resume that details my
academic qualifications and practical experience. I am
excited about stepping into a position, which will
utilize my technical, analytical, and interpersonal
skills in a fast paced environment, and look forward
to expanding my horizons with new challenges and
opportunities that ENRON Corporation   will offer. I
know from customer and supervisor feedback that I have
the interpersonal skills imperative to building a
successful career at the ENRON Corporation and am
motivated to do so. Your firm has an excellent
reputation and I genuinely look forward to becoming a
part of the ENRON Corporation community.

I know you must be busy during this time of the year,
but I would sincerely appreciate a few minutes of your
time. I plan to call you within the next seven days to
discuss how my education, practical skills, and
background would qualify me as a member of your
company. In the meantime, if you need to contact me,
my daytime and nighttime number is (512) 474-6683 and
my e-mail address is knirel@mail.utexas.edu.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I
look forward to talking to you.

Sincerely,

Nina Knirel

Thanks for you message.
My group hires almost exclusively people with background in quantitative

Dr. Kaminski,

Thank you very much.
Of course, I'll be happy to have an opportunity
to work at such a wonderful company.
I was contacting with Surech Raghavan at Deal Bench team,
and was going to express my appreciation to you again
after settling down process with them.

For the period of working,
I still need to coordinate with my advisor and
may need to adjust according to that.
but anyway, I'll try to coordinate smoothly.

Please let me know whether I should keep contacting
with Deal Bench team,
for working period and
for misc. living support such as finding a place, rent a car, etc.

I appreciate you so much again,
for arranging such meetings and giving me an opportunity.
All this opportunity will not be available to me,
without your kind help.

Warm Regards,
Jinbaek

Vince- I spoke with London just now.
Here is what I gather Vuthy said about Howard Haughton.
********************************************************
1. He wants a second-round (another interview with Enron)- but, with high 
officials (Senior Management, this time).

2. He didn't think the interviewers were understanding his technical 
abilities and language.

********************************************************
Good News: He (Howard) wants to come back for another interview. I was lead 
to believe it went well although, Howard believes in protocol.

Bad News: Howard in on vacation now for 10 days.

Sounds fairly good on the candidate debrief.

Thanks, Vince.

Dear Vince,

I am so grateful for your efforts.  I really appreciate you taking time from 
your busy schedule.  If you have not contacted Michael Maddox, it's even 
better.  I have updated and re-worded my resume to better reflect my 
accomplishments.  Would you please contact Michael Maddox of CERA and forward 
my resume to him?  His contact information is (617) 497 6446 or email: 
mmaddox@cera.com

Have you had a chance to talk to David Port?  Maybe there are other options.  
I am flexible and willing to do whatever it takes.



Sincerely,

Hi Vince and Molly.
Here attached is one candidate who is particularly interested in having his 
profile sent to Vince...he is going to be traveling to NY from the UK soon 
for 2 wks.
He specifically asked my partner at RobertWalters in the UK to investigate 
Enron through my new relationship with you guys. He would be Howard Haughton, 
attached below (CV).

The other 2 resumes are my students at the University of Michigan. Howard Lin 
received a 4.0/4.0 for his last term and will be willing to do whatever it 
takes to intern at Enron for June- Aug. I have his picture included as well. 
The second is Sung, they are friends. Howy will be done expected in May 2001 
and Sung in May 2002. They are my favorite interns and I expect they can be 
cultivated to the Enron culture with no real cost to you (a "test drive 
before committal. I have agreed to represent them and
shall take ownership, as they become graduate candidates upon their degree 
completion.

I hope these attachment can represent my value and commitment to quality of 
talent to Enron.

Thank you for your acceptance.
Best wishes for the weekend.
Jeff

Alex worked with Jitendra on VAR review in the past.  He did not strike me as 
a dynamic person.  I cannot use him for my group, and I am lukewarm about 
getting him for Research Group.  If Bryan wants to hire him directly for his 
KMV experience, then we can work with him.

Dear Mr. McSherry:

I   am   responding  to  your  search  for  credit  risk  professionals  on  
the
enroncredit.com   website.   After  working  for  seven  years  on  credit  
risk
management  in  a  research and consulting capacity, I would like to transfer 
my
experience  in  assessing  credit  risk  modeling,  information  technology  
and
methodology  in  complex  top-tier  institutions  to  an  active  credit 
trading
managerial   environment.   I  am  excited  about  being  involved  in  
trading,
origination, risk management and R&D of credit derivatives.

I  have  seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and 
management.  I
have  helped  design,  test  and implement credit value-at-risk systems with 
KMV
Corp  and  with  a  major  Japanese  bank.   I was a major contributor at KMV 
in
designing the Expected Default Frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar 
with
its  assumptions,  strengths,  weaknesses and applications.  I did the 
empirical
research  that  lies  behind the KMV default correlation model, the private 
firm
EDF  model  and  I interfaced with J.P. Morgan (now R.M.G.) personnel during 
the
creation of the CreditMetrics documentation.

I  have  excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming 
skills.
I studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied 
credit
risk theory while I worked with KMV and Arthur Andersen.  I am eager to join 
the
credit derivative team at Enroncredit.com where I am certain that my 
combination
of   quantitative   research  skills,  credit  risk  consulting  experience  
and
technology   expertise   make  me  uniquely  qualified  to  support  the  
credit
derivatives trading and risk management function.

I  have  included  my  resume  with this e-mail.  Please e-mail me or call me 
at
201-420-0191  (home)  and  212-708-4027  (work)  so  that  we  can  discuss 
this
opportunity further.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

I am very sorry to tell you that I have to cancel my interview with you
scheduled on Feb 9th. I had a job offer from Citadel Investment at Chicago
with a deadline on Feb 5th. I have been trying to get an extension for the
past week and unfortunately it failed today. With this very short time
frame, it is impossible for me and Enron's interviewing process to meet the
Feb 5th deadline. How unwillingly, I would not be able to visit Enron for
after taking Citadel's offer. I hope you will find another candidate from
our class. There are some people still available. I will be happy to help
you get in touch with those interested.

Please keep in touch and I wish you well in your business!

Vince,

We had phone interview with Rabi De.  My impression is good. We should invite 
him for a formal interview.

He is a hands on person with wide range of experience ( energy financing, 
derivatives trading, hedging, etc).
He communicates very well and expressed interest in financial engineering & 
modeling.

Subject: summer work..


Long time no see,
How have you been...must be busy and living a challenging life?
I have been pretty busy too,
to finish a project and write a paper, these days.

Everything looks going OK for my summer internship.
I took necessary steps to work out of campus, and sent
signed contract to Molly a week ago..

Here is what I am expecting to do in the summer.
Please let me know if you have any change in mind.
Actually, I wonder a little bit if DealBench changed its business model...
and maybe you got priority in something different
because it has been quite a while since we talked.
I'd like to what's going on in DealBench team...
Raghavan and Ross,
if we talk over phone it will be great!

Dr. Kaminski,
If you think there is something else interesting to work with during the
summer,
to both you and I, please let me know.
My interest is auction, market design, and simulation.
I am taking a financial engineering class, (mostly on option pricing)
and working on electricity generator valuation problem based on
spark spread option.

All of you,
Let's keep in touch until we meet in June!!

Best Regards,
Jinbaek

Richard:

I am Vince Kaminski's assistant, and Vince received an email from you 
yesterday concerning employment for Mark Giancola.  He forwarded the
email to Maureen Raymond, Sr. Economist with the Research Group.

She is currently looking for an associate Economist and would very much
like to interview Mark.

Can you let us know the best way to approach this?  Can you contact him 
or should I send him an email asking him to give us some dates he might 
be available for an interview.

Your quick response will be appreciated.

Thanks Richard!

Good Morning,

I enjoyed visiting you yesterday afternoon to discuss the opportunity at
Enron.  Sounds exciting, challenging and a good use of a lot of my skills and
experience.  I look forward to further talks, hopefully this coming week.

I mentioned a couple web sites and don't know if they came through clearly on
the phone with my sore throat.

The neural network approach to timing can be found at
http://www.pfr.com/ptonline/

The introductory piece on technical analysis I wrote for Forbes.com and the
glossary can be found at htttp://www.forbes.com/tool/html/00/Jun/0603/feat.htm

I am also working with long time friend and neighbor Steve Nison with his
site and you can see the first on line lesson for free at
http://www.candlecharts.com/


Have a nice weekend.  Hope to hear from you next week.

Hi, Dr. Kaminski:

   I am Zhendong, the student of Dr. Deng. I think Dr. Deng has sent my
resume to you. I am very happy to have an opportunity to work with you
this summer.
   I am a student in both MS qcf and Ph.d EDA programs in Georgia Tech
now. I plan to find a job in industry instead of academic after my
graduation. So I intend to do internship during the process of prusuing my
degree to acquire some experience for my future career.
   I hope to start on 5/14/2001 and end on 8/17/2001.
   Thanks a lot.

I was very pleased to have an wonderful telephone interview with you.
It's exciting and challenging. I like it.
I talked to my financial engineering program classmate, Bob Lee who
was just hired by Enron recently. He told me he is very impressed by
your company and very excited to work there.
I believe I'm a strong candidate for this position. I'd like to share
more my background and experience with you.
I look forward to meeting you. Thank you.

P.S. Thank Shirley for her coordinate work. When I come to Houston,
I may need her help again.

Sincerely,

Jeff He

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek

Mr. Kaminski,

I have attached a resume below I thought you might find of interest, it is 
from a Business School acquaintance of mine, Denis Suvorov.  Denis is a 
highly intelligent Ph.D. candidate at my former school and is currently 
looking for opportunities within a research/modelling framework.  He has 
significant academic experience working on Asset pricing models and after 
speaking with Pavel Zadorozhny about his background and objectives, he 
recommended I forward a copy of his credentials to you.

I hope this is suitable and would be of interest to you.  

Thanks,
Matthew Frank

Subject:	Potential Prospect


Hey Vince,

Given that the Eastern Finance Conference is already taking place, I think
it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round
table discussion.  However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially
having been on such a round table discussion.

I've been teaching a "real options" course that has the students performing
monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along
with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your
new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course.
However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is
particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option
pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually
figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.

This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented
themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you
and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you
recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?

His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would
preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is
George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a
potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a
particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.

Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too
much.

This is a letter from one of the job applicants who works for PROS.
It seems that the system they develop for Williams

Dear Vince:

It was so nice meeting and talking with you too. I did
not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in
Enron.

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I
have been working two years as Lead Scientist and
Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue
Management Inc. in Houston.

I developed and implemented the mathematical models
for Trading Optimization System and Firm
Transportation Optimization System.

The Trading Optimization System becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the
contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years.

Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management. I am
confident that I can make significant contributions to
Enron in this area.

I would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
Enron.

Sincerely Yours


Jacob

Vince,

A quick update on job candidates:

1)  Nelson Neale:   relayed your request to Norman, and told Nelson that an
offer is in progress.  Did not mention specific numbers to him.

2) Charles Shen:  left a message for him that we would get back to him next
week with details of an offer.

3)  Interviewed by phone Tom Barkley at Thunderbird (brought to our
attention by Enron recruiters there).   He looks very interesting so I am
trying to schedule a visit to Enron for him.   He will finish T-bird in
December (MBA) and has a bachelors with honours in Mathematics.


Have a great weekend.

Stinson

Stinson,

Thank you for your e-mail.  My phone number is (617) 492-9551.  

I graduated from Princeton University in 1996 (mathematics), and came 
straight to MIT for a
Ph.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.  In my first
three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics,
optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses in
psychology (at MIT and Harvard).  I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran,
and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.  In
particular, I am interested in the interaction between customers and
companies (hence the interest in psychology).  The (tentative) title of my
PhD thesis is "Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet", and I am
sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will
give you an idea of what this research is about.

Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your research
group next week.

Paulo


Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet


Objective:

To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold
on
the internet.


Motivation:

This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and 
optimization
models are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.  The technological
innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
information
which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.
Furthermore,
companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can
have access to.

The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue
faced
by internet companies.  Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g.
VCRs
or computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.  Companies can show
different products and different prices to each consumer.  This type of
flexibility
was not available until the internet came about.

The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.  The
methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of
other settings, such as pricing services.  Services are unique, and there are
many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a
given company.  Our model will help companies decide which services to offer
to which customers and how much to charge for these services.


Research Strategy:

Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components
which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.  These
components are choice models and optimization models.


Choice Models:

Choice models describe how customers make choices.  The management literature
draws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.  The
common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic
elimination methods.  These methods consist of the elimination of options
based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice
remains.
These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves very
easily to mathematical analysis.  Economists focus on utility-maximing models
that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological
models.
The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.  The problem with
these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how
consumer make choices on the internet.  The first step in our research will
be
to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between
customers
and companies on the internet.

Optimization:

Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a
certain planning horizon.  On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenue
still exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.  Short term
profit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you know
your customers and are able to retain them.  The optimization problem must
therefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component
(learning).

Dr. Kaminski:
?
You probably won't remember my name, but I am the Ph.D.  student that took 
you back to the airport after your visit to Louisiana State  University 
during the previous academic year.
?
I received my M.S. in Finance in May of last year, and chose  to?remain at 
LSU to work on my Ph.D. At that time, I intended to pursue a  career 
in?teaching and research at a four year college or university.?  In 
part?because of your visit,?and my?primary interest in  normative research, 
my?plans have changed.? While I?still want to  earn my Ph.D.,?I plan to 
pursue a career in research in the private  sector.
?
As you know, Ph.D. programs in financial economics are  designed to train 
future academics.? Not surprisingly, they emphasize  methods to approach the 
types of questions that are of interest to finance  academics.? What did 
surprise me, however, was that these areas of interest  often had little to 
do with what I imagined to be the concerns of practitioners  in the real 
world.? As you mentioned in your discussion, academic  researchers know 
little about what their counterparts in the private sector  
are?doing.?????????????????????????????????????  
?
In light of my objective, I feel I would get the most out of  the remainder 
of my doctoral studies if I took some time off to work in the  private sector 
to see first hand the?types of challenges I can expect to  face as a 
researcher in corporate America.? As my primary interests revolve  around the 
use of derivatives and financial engineering in corporate risk  management, 
Enron, as the leading innovator in these areas, would be an ideal  place to 
learn.? I was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the  company 
that might provide me with the exposure I am looking for.? If there  are no 
such positions or opportunities, any advice or suggestions you could give  
me,?such as whether or not you think such a "sabbatical" (for lack of a  
better term) would be helpful, or information on private sector careers for  
Ph.D.'s would be greatly appreciated.? 
?
I am sending a current copy of my vita as an attachment.?  If you have any 
questions my e-mail address is sgreen@finance.lsu.edu.? Thanks  for your help 
and advice.
?
?
Cordially,
?

interview the week of the 18th:

1. Kerryn Hawke
2. Stephen Cusack

also strong but not available for that week is

3. Piero Chessa (working for ECMWF in Italy)

we have a couple others here in the states if the London interviews don't 
work out.

Dear Mr. McSherry:

I   am   responding  to  your  search  for  credit  risk  professionals  on  
the
enroncredit.com   website.   After  working  for  seven  years  on  credit  
risk
management  in  a  research and consulting capacity, I would like to transfer 
my
experience  in  assessing  credit  risk  modeling,  information  technology  
and
methodology  in  complex  top-tier  institutions  to  an  active  credit 
trading
managerial   environment.   I  am  excited  about  being  involved  in  
trading,
origination, risk management and R&D of credit derivatives.

I  have  seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and 
management.  I
have  helped  design,  test  and implement credit value-at-risk systems with 
KMV
Corp  and  with  a  major  Japanese  bank.   I was a major contributor at KMV 
in
designing the Expected Default Frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar 
with
its  assumptions,  strengths,  weaknesses and applications.  I did the 
empirical
research  that  lies  behind the KMV default correlation model, the private 
firm
EDF  model  and  I interfaced with J.P. Morgan (now R.M.G.) personnel during 
the
creation of the CreditMetrics documentation.

I  have  excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming 
skills.
I studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied 
credit
risk theory while I worked with KMV and Arthur Andersen.  I am eager to join 
the
credit derivative team at Enroncredit.com where I am certain that my 
combination
of   quantitative   research  skills,  credit  risk  consulting  experience  
and
technology   expertise   make  me  uniquely  qualified  to  support  the  
credit
derivatives trading and risk management function.

I  have  included  my  resume  with this e-mail.  Please e-mail me or call me 
at
201-420-0191  (home)  and  212-708-4027  (work)  so  that  we  can  discuss 
this
opportunity further.

                               Can we  meet for a quick lunch again at your 
convenience? Just to bring you up to date about my search for the right 
opportunity. Also I noticed in the Risk magazine that Enron Investment 
Partners and AIG have joined TreasuryConnect as strategic partners to 
capitalize on internet-based transaction execution of financial derivatives. 
I would like to explore if I can be any help to Hank Finkenstaedt, the 
Director of Enron Investment Partners.

                            Please let me know what day and time might be 
convenient for you.


Thank you.

Sincerely,

                            Dear Mr. Kaminski:

                            I would  like to explore the opportunity to join 
Enron Investment Partners. I understand that Enron has $20 million fund set 
up to finance start-ups, and Gene Humphreys and his assistant John Godbold 
are trying to attract minority -owned start-up firms. I also learned that 
Enron has plans to increase the size of this fund to $200 million. I can find 
these opportunities for Enron around the Globe. Given my background as a 
Chartered Financial Analyst, with hands-on experience in investment 
management covering financial derivatives, fixed income, and equity, I can be 
a valuable resource to do the due diligence, origination, valuation, and 
monitoring of these start-ups. Would you please help me arrange a meeting 
with either Gene Humphreys, Ted Murphy, or may be Ken Lay?

I am pasting below the job opportunities open at Enron. I am also interested 
in these positions and would like to meet with the hiring manager.

I will give you a call to follow up.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Zadorozhny:

Maxim Philippov suggested that I write you. Being a first-year MBA student
at Owen Graduate School of Management (Vanderbilt University) with a Finance
concentration, I am looking for a Summer Associate position at Enron.

The area of my particular interest is Enron's risk management products
(commodity derivatives research and trading). Graduating from Novosibirsk
State University with major in physics, I am eager to apply my experience
with the use of theoretical and statistical physics techniques to the
managing of modeling processes and creating complex financial and trading
models. I strongly believe that my graduate education coupled with
undergraduate background in physics, solid work experience in finance and
proven entrepreneurial spirit will allow me to contribute to Enron as a
Summer Associate.

I would really appreciate your advice regarding employment opportunities at
Enron and would like to find out more about Enron Capital & Trade Resources
Corp. I will call you within this week to follow up on my request.

Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,

Dmitri Villevald

Enclosure: resume

 <<Resume.doc>>
P.S. Looking through an example of margin risk hedging at Enron's Web site,
I think I found a small mistake there. URL of this page is

<http://www.ect.enron.com/products/risk/margin_intro.fset.html> (producer
application)

The second sentence of the paragraph beginning with "Paradigm and Enron
exchange..."
states the following.

For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then
Paradigm will pay Enron $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is
$2.00/MMBtu, then Enron will pay Paradigm $0.62/MMBtu.

I believe, if I am reading it correctly, the money should flow in the
opposite direction, namely:

For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then
Enron will pay Paradigm $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is
$2.00/MMBtu, then Paradigm will pay Enron $0.62/MMBtu.

Am I right?

Again, thank you very much for your time.

Hi,

     Thank you for your email.  I am indeed interested in exploring
opportunities in your group - Research (Quantitative Modeling).

     Just a note to let you know that I am not in the pure quantitative 
research
group here at BNP Paribas - but in the derivatives structured products.  I do
some of my own modeling and basic excel programming. I used to do a lot of
Fortran programming.   However, I am not a very good C/C++ programmer.

     Hope this gives you further details about my skills and interests.

Thank you,
Iris

Iris,

At this point it's my group: Research, i.e. Quantitative Modeling.
Please, let me know what your interests are and I shall try to line up
other groups for the interview.

in

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more

Celeste,

I was under the impression I sent you a message regarding Brad Romine but
I cannot find a copy in my msg folder. There might have been a glitch in the 
CC-mail
and the message did not go through and wasn't  stored.

I wanted to make the following points:

1. Brad will not show up on March 15. He is still working on his dot-com 
business and wants to
pursue this opportunity.

2. My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand. Either Brad 
or a stipend
refund check should show up on March 15.

3. I told Brad that  a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his 
future employment opportunities
with Enron. We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource 
needs. If he decides to re-apply
at some point in the future, we shall not hold his  decision  to pursue him 
entrepreneurial plans against him.

Please, let me  know what you think.

Vince

Hi Vince,
Here are two guys:
The first asked for you (The guy from Oxford).
The second has a "high profile" name-brand risk job.

Candidate 1: Done at Oxford in Sept. Math Finance.
             Will move anywhere necessary.
             Citibank/Andersen consulting background.
             Well known candidate in London.
             Fixed Income/structured contol of 450 mil.
             I have direct ownership and contact with.
             This guy is really impressive by phone!
             Highly recommended by Dr. Donnelly Oxford

Candidate 2: No real Investment Banking/Energy risk experiences...but, asked 
me to get him out in London as he and his wife lived/worked there for FORD 
CREDIT EUROPE. Has operational risk skills and experience! Can probably steal 
him away from Ford (Ford has no agreement with me)...he is fair game.

Thanks for the consideration!
Jeff

Dear Vince,

Please find attached a copy of my resume.  I have
talked with Christy Young and Beth Miertschin, the
college recruiters for the A&A Program regarding
my interest in an internship at Enron this
summer.  I understand that within the Analyst
Program, there are 4 rotational options; of those,
I would be most interested in one of the "Finance
rotations."  I would be happy to explore one of
the number of groups within this area.  (Please
let me know if this is sufficient or if you will
need me to give more specific indication of which
department I would like to be considered for an
internship.)

I greatly appreciate your consideration regarding
my job opportunities with Enron.  Please let me
know if there is anything else I can do to
facilitate this process.  I look forward to our
meeting again.

Sincerely,
Van Ngo

P.S. Shirley, I have mailed to you my parking
permit.  Please contact me if you had any problems
with it.

Hi there,
I am favourably impressed by Martin. I think he's an intelligent person
and understands the power industry. He has good ideas about
modeling various of  things (even though he thinks that 
technical constraints are just technicalities and are easy to deal with).

Please take note that he admitted he does not like to 
write code (he has/had someone else doing it for him).

 I want to thank you for giving me this excellent opportunity to meet with
Enron Research Group.  I would be my pleasure to visit with you any time
after 3 PM September 12-15 th.  If this time frame is not suitable for you,
please let me know.  Also, it would be preferable for me to schedule the
interview as late as you can in the afternoon or as early in the morning as
possible.
 As I has already mentioned above, I am very honored by the interest
displayed by Enron Research Group in interviewing me.  I believe your company
displays an excellent example of the well respected leader of the energy
industry.  Enron's overall orientation of staying on the cutting edge of
technology (with such breathtaking projects as e-commerce development) will
make the employment with Enron very interesting, pleasant, and rewarding
experience.  Furthermore, it will provide me with an excellent opportunity to
make the contribution to your company's continuing growth and profit.

Darren,

Tanya and I had a telephone interview for Yumi.    I do not know what
kind of position you would offer her.

If you intended to let her do the work on quantitative modeling, her knowledge
in math seems very sallow.  She is working on a math degree on stochastic
process, but she can not explain what Ito' lemma is.  We also asked questions
about volatility of a basket, value at risk, etc. she did not have a clear 
answer.

If you intended to let her to be a junior trader, she might be ok. It seems 
she has
some experience of financial market, but I think you are much more qualified 
to
probe her than I do in this aspect.

Keep in touch,

Best Regards

Zimin

Elizabeth,

Yes, she referred Norberto to us. We had an informal interview
with him.

We would like to  invite him for a round of formal interviews later this week.
Please include me, Tanya Tamarchenko, Ted Murphy, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni,
Grant Masson.

I asked Liza to talk to you to set up formal arrangements with Enron
HR (a contract, fee schedule approval, etc.).

I shall ask you for help next week when we have more information:
several members of our group  from London will rotate through our Houston
office this summer. We shall need help in making living  arrangements,
including apartments, car, etc. Also, we have an employee from India
rotating through our group this summer. Please, let me know 
who is the best person in HR to ask for assistance.

Dear Lance,

Thank you very much for all of your help through this process.

At present, I am really tied up with Mock Market activities in Austin
Energy. It would be inappropriate for me to leave at this time since the
whole project will be jeopardized. Therefore, I decided not coming to
Houston for an interview.  I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this
may cause you.

I do appreciate what you did and hope we can keep in touch in the future.

Thank you again for your help and wish you best.

Dear Vince:

Thanks for your response.

I am not a programmer, nor a "quant".  I am an expert in Excel and otherwise
have advanced skills in the remaining MSOffice Suite.  Beyond that I have
extensive experience working with research and computer progamming personnel
on projects from networks to databases, and in particular, automation.

For instance, the first generation of the risk analytics system that I
designed for Quantlab was done in Excel.  In subsequent generations of the
system, Excel served only as the GUI - given its extreme flexibility - and a
SQL database operated underneath (Compaq servers, RAID array), integrating
real-time operations for all components of the system.

The research team at Quantlab used many leading edge modelling
methodologies, such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, principal
component analysis, kernel density estimation, fast kernel regression,
Hidden Markov Modelling and many other pattern recognition, walk-forward
back testing, and other simulation techniques.

I was the sole individual on a team of 17 that had any practical trading
experience, and therefore, felt that I played a critical role in the
application and implementation of each of the system components from data
mining to research to signal generation to execution.  Beyond that, I was
uniquely qualified to articulate the project's mission to investors, and
therefore, was highly successful in spearheading support - financial and
otherwise - from our network.

Althought I did not ask specifically, I surmise from your question that you
are leading a research effort.  I believe that my skill set is best served
as a liaison between research and trading, since I speak both languages.  I
believe that I possess great vision and enthusiasim that could be leveraged
in a group, project or product management role to integrate and streamline
diverse systems and processes; a common scenario in most proprietary
development settings today.

In closing, I would like to learn more about Enron and the financial
technology effort therein through further discussion with you, or if that is
not appropriate, someone to whom you would be comfortable referring me.

I look forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Paul

We had spoken a few weeks back, but were unable to meet due to our

appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and take your advice. 

As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in exploring opportunities 
that are more US focused.  I think Paula Corey has already forwarded my

I would really appreciate the opportunity to meet with you next week, and

Dear Dr.Kaminski,

it has been a long time since I contacted you so I was wondering if
my resume had been considered for an internship in your group.

I will appreciate it very much if you let me know when I should expect
to learn about a decision on the issue.

Thank you for you time.

Dear Mr. Masson:

Thank you very much for offering me an opportunity to work in your group.
However because of family reasons, I have to regrettably inform you that I
will not be able to make the move at this time. It has been a great
experience working  with you on this process, and I greatly appreciate your
help.

I realized that this would have been a great opportunity for me, and I thank
you very much for everything. I hope you will still consider me for a
position in the future.

Sincerely,
Ben

Vince,

Zimin and I talked briefly about the part-time work this morning. To recap;
I am willing to work 20 hours a week, however, I expressed my concern about
commuting every week. I asked if commuting once every two weeks (and work
out of Austin every other week) would be acceptable. As to the term of the
work, I suggested a 3-mo period (I have yet not talked to international
office which arranges work authorization using Curricular Practical Training
of which I have used up 9 months already), I might run into problems if I
ask for more. I also mentioned that I would do my best to accomodate your
preferences. We did not discuss any other details.

I shall be awaiting for your response on this matter.

Best,

Hi Vince.
Look at this guy (picture included).

He is "Lawrence", the guy I spoke to you about last week that you said you 
wanted to see.

He asked me if he can do a phone interview...I think Williams, Ford and 
SDCERA are soliciting him.
If I told him You and ENRON are interested- he would drop the others off the 
map for a chance to interview with you.

I like him too as he follows my instructions as is pleasant to work with 
(most are not).

Do you want to chat with him?

On your command,
Jeff Wesley

Hello Mr. Kudin:

Vince Kaminski has asked me to schedule interviews for you with some 
of the Research Group.  However, Tuesday, the 8th is not a good day for 
everyone as we will need approximately 3 hours.

Could you do it Thursday afternoon May 10th?  We could start at 1:00 PM
and be through by 4:00 PM.

The interviewers would be:

Vince Kaminski  Managing Director
Stinson Gibner  Vice President
Krishna Krishnarao Vice President
Tanya Tamarchenko Director
Zimin Lu  Director
Alex Huang  Director

Please let me know if this will work for you.  If so, I will need you to 
forward
me a copy of your resume.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw

Vince,

Chonawee and Tom Halliburton had  feedback about Jacob to me.

Tom's feedback is what he does for Pros is actually too simple. Their 
so-called 
trading system is actually a scheduling system.

My impression is that Jacob is good at selling himself, his knowledge
of finance and derivatives is very limited.

Subject: Jacob feedback


I asked Jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge. He answered 
correctly in the optimization question so I believe that he has a good 
foundation on his optimization skill. I have a doubt about his stochastic 
skill because he took only one course in Stochastic Processes and his 
previous models are simple deterministic models. If we had more interview 
time I would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills.

He completely failed to answer the second question, which is to check his 
basic risk management skill. It is clear to me that he has a very weak 
background in finance and risk management. He does not understand the 
relationship between a discount rate and risk. He showed some weakness in 
annuity calculation.
 
In conclusion, I feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak 
background in finance. Based on his experiences, I have a doubt on his 
advance optimization skills, such as his stochastic skill and his ability to 
attack a complex optimization problem. I would recommend a second-round 
interview if he will be solving a complex-optimization problem.

Celeste,

I would like to ask you for a favor. We would like to have Sevil as an intern 
in our group
this summer. She prepares a Ph.D. dissertation  on transmission: a critical 
issue to the power
markets everywhere.

I have also a few other students I would like to take in as summer interns. I 
shall send you 
the resumes in separate messages.

Subject: Summer Internship Position


Hi Dr. Kaminski,

As I told you last Monday in Dr. Kao's class I am
looking for a summer internship position in your group
in which I can use my economics background together
with my quantitative skills and knowledge in
electricity markets. Currently, I am a third year
Ph.D. student at the Economics Department of  the
University of Houston. At the end of this semester
I'll be completing my coursework and starting to write
my dissertation which analyzes the access pricing
issue in network industries, especially in electricity
transmission.
I would like to give you a few examples from my
coursework. In addition to basic Statistics I-II and
Econometrics I-II, I have taken "Macroeconomic
Modeling and Forecasting" (Time Series) class in which
I learned RATS. In "Applied Econometrics" class, it
was given a great deal of attention to the case method
learning approach that involved extensive computer
analysis. We were taught SAS. As a term paper I worked
on electricity demand forecasting. This semester I am
taking "Special Topics in Applied Econometrics" course
in which I am being taught Qualitative Dependent
Models, MLE, Panel Data Techniques, and so on, and as
software STATA. Moreover, this semester I am also
taking "Options Theory and Its Applications" class and
auditing Dr. Kao's class. I definitely agree with you
in what you mentioned in your lecture last Monday
about the understanding of the options theory as a
necessity in the energy sector.
Besides, I spent my last summer in the Oil and Gas
unit of the World Bank as a research assistant. This
work experience in which I had great exposure to the
energy market issues and my own research area, which
is regulation of transmission pricing (congestion
pricing), made me believe that the ongoing
restructuring of the electricity sector, especially
the transmission network issue, could be well
understood by working in the industry.
Dr. Kaminski, attached you can find my resume. I would
be glad if you could find a chance to review it and
get back to me soon.

Many thanks,

Hi, Vince

I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to interview for a
position with your group.  I find the work described very interesting and
the work environment very appealing.

I think the retail area would be a good match with my skills and
interests, and I could make a contribution very quickly.  I believe that
the Power and Options Valuation areas would make a good fit as well, if
that matches your needs.

Thanks again,

Bob Lee

Subject: Re: Summer Internship Position

Hi Vince, Paulo Oleira (one of the M.I.T attending our meeting on wed)'s 
research interest turned out to be a match for April Hodgeson (VP of content 
origination). I had him talk to April (Stinson was on the call as well) to 
discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for April.  I 
suggested (and April agrees) that Paulo would intern with her and Matt and 
perform research on how end users (consumers and business) improved 
experience with ePowered content can be quantified.  This may include 
performing control experiments at M.I.T.  We decided not to over specify what 
he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives.  I suggested 
once he starts, he will work with April and Matt Harris (VP enterprise 
origination) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the 
internship.  

Addiontionally, Tom Gros agrees that this type of research are needed and 
this is a great way to start.

I will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start 
around May 22, 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise.

Regards,

Ravi.

P.S. Charlene, please include Paulo in your May 22, 2000 start group.  Paulo 
will report to me within EBS research group but will work on a day-to-day 
basis with April and Matt. As you've mentioned that compensation is somewhat 
fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a PhD candidate with very 
specialized skill set. Please contact Vince before extending an offer that

Celeste,

We need to make sure that the interns in Vince's group are coordinated and 
incorporated with the rest of the summer associates.  They should be offered 
the same starting dates, I believe they are May 22, 2000 June 5, 2000.  I am 
not sure about the June date.  Would you check and let Vince know.  They 
should also be offered the same starting salary package as the others.  They 
will be included in training (a few days) and any other events we host.
Thanks

The interviewers would be:

Vince Kaminski		Managing Director
Stinson Gibner		Vice President
Krishna Krishnarao	Vice President
Tanya Tamarchenko	Director
Zimin Lu		Director

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee.

Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing
analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++
programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron.

My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in
this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

 Dear Dr. Kaminski

 We have talked earlier during your energy class at Rice about career
opportunities in risk management at Enron. If it is possible, I would like
to meet with you and people from your group next week, preferably Tuesday
(May 8). My time is flexible, I could come any time. Other days are also
fine.

 Thank you very much in advance.

 Sincerely,
 Konstantin Kudin

Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:
There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
in e-marketplace payment initiative,
where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players
along with Citibank.
He asked me whether you can contact a person at
ENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.
He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON
to see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.

Here is a link to news related to the initiative,

http://www.internetweek.com/story/INW20000808S0001

Fourth:
My advisor wants to know whether
there could be any opportunity to do a case study,
regarding ENRON's business.
He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.
Business model and System architecture...

Thanks for reading this long email.
I'll look forward to your answer..
I am sorry for giving you so much burden
to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

Vince: 
	This is a candidate from Stanford I mentioned to you about last Friday. He is a  student of my thesis advisor there. He seems to have solid math and statistics background (including stochastic calculus) and his thesis is on supply-chains. You mentioned about two possible positions: one in Net Works and another in Freight trading.

Thanks,
Krishna.

Dr. Pinnamaneni V. Krishnarao
Vice President, Enron Corporation

Dear Dr. Krishnarao,

Professor Veinott told me a little about the research going on at Enron
from his conversation with you late last week. The work sounded very
interesting to me. Professor Veinott also told me that the research group
at Enron may have some positions for which I might be qualified. I am
writing to let you know that I would have great interest in exploring this
potential opportunity with you. To that end I attach my resume together
with an abstract of my Ph.D. thesis under Professor Veinott as a Word
document. I might also add that I expect to finish my Ph.D. in Management
Science and Engineering here by July 1, 2001.

Incidentally, my work has led me to study your own thesis in some detail
and I have been very impressed with it. It may be of some interest to you
that our work is related and seems to require a different generalization
of Karush's additivity-preservation theorem than the lovely ones you
develop.

   I look forward to hearing from you.

                                                 Sincerely,


                                                 Ningxiong Xu

Please respond to Dear Mr.Kaminski,

I have found the EnronOnline project a very interesting one and have enjoyed
working with everyone in the Research department as well as those from other
departments. I am keenly interested in this area and was wondering if there
would be any summer internship opportunities. I have attached my resume to
this mail for your review and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you

Good afternoon Mike:

I certainly am interested in determining if there may be a potential fit
there at Enron.  I am very enthusiastic to apply my finance and meteorology
backgrounds in a market-based environment that is driven to achieve
unprecedented efficiencies.  Attached are two documents:  1) a
business-focused resume, and 2) an abbreviated Meteorology CV.

Graduate Meteorology coursework included Advanced Atmospheric Dynamics I and
II, Advanced Physical Meteorology, Boundary Layer Modeling, Numerical
Modeling, Research Methods in Meteorology, and Turbulence.

I will look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Greg Hunt

Attached is the resume of Mark Giancola.  Mark is the husband of Penny Pan, a 
UVa business school student for whom I was mentor last summer.  Penny has 
received a permanent offer and is inclined to accept if her husband can find 
suitable employment in Houston.  As you will see from his resume, Mark has 
worked as an economist in the public and private sectors for the past 2.5 
years.    Mark is interested in a role where he can use his abilities to 
analyze political, credit currency and related risks.  Please let me know if 
you have any interest.  Thanks, Rich

John:  Is there a place here in EnronCredit.com?

______________________________________________________________________________
_________



Penny mentioned that you might have some ideas about job opportunities
in Houston for someone with my background.  As you know, Penny was
pleased to receive an offer from Enron and I plan to earnestly look into
the Houston job market myself.

The weeks leading up to the annual IMF/World Bank meetings are one of
the busiest times of year for us, but now that they are over I have had a
chance to update my resume (attached).  I would be grateful if you
would take a look and pass it on to anyone you think might be interested.

As you will see, most of my background is policy related, and most
recently international economic policy.  However the skills I have
developed have applicability in the private sector as well.  For example, a
large part of my job at the Treasury involves sovereign risk analysis.
Two possible avenues I see for building on this knowledge are: 1)
applying my knowledge to decisions regarding allocation of global
financial assets; or 2) identifying risks facing a mutinational company and
developing strategies to reduce that risk.

I should mention that in addition to my economics training I do understand
basic finance, and I am preparing to begin the CFA.  I should also note
that the work environment here at the Treasury is quite fast paced, with
constant deadlines and a great deal of pressure placed on economists.  I
tend to work 55+ hours per week so I do not expect I would need to
adjust signifiantly if I were to move to the private sector.

I greatly appreciate your taking the time to look at my resume and giving
some thought to where I might look.  I welcome any comments and ideas
you might have.

Thanks,
Mark Giancola

p.s. the formatting on my resume seems to change whenever I e-mail it;
let me know if you prefer that I fax it to you.

I am forwarding the resume of Wendell Licon who works for Enron
in the HR department (executive compensation). He used to be an
FX trader. I am thinking about moving him to research when his current boss
is ready to release him.

I think, however, that you
should take a look at him as well and see if he fits your needs.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

It was very nice to talk with you Saturday morning during the "voleyball
event".  Thanks a lot for offering your help in passing my resume to the
EnronOnline business people.  I am very excited about the possibility of
being part of the team involved with e-commerce at Enron.  Please find my
resume and cover letter attached.

Hope you have a good trip to California next week!

Thanks a lot

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with 
Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor 
fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience.  Publications are available on request.

I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email.

Thank you for your time.

Dear Bill:

Thank you very much for volunteering to circulate my resume within Enron. As 
you know, I am interested in exploring career opportunities in Financial 
Engineering within Enron. I am particularly interested in joining the 
research group headed by Dr. Vince Kaminski. 

Enron continues to innovate its way through the energy and telecom 
marketplace using its substantial intellectual capital. The enclosed resume 
details my experience, academic background, and contributions in the area of 
risk modeling and management. Understanding risk is a core competency of 
Enron and I am excited about the possibility of working, learning, and 
growing with the very best in the industry.

Please forward my resume within Enron as you see fit. Thank you in advance 
for any referrals or recommendations you may be able to provide. 

Best regards,

Rabi S. De

Dear Vince:

How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After
having been working for Williams for about two years,
now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a
great company, I am wondering whether there is any
opportunity for me, either in research group or in
structure group

Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
and in charge of the quantitative research group with
7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
research and modeling about electricity,
load-following deal and tolling deals.

If you need any additional information, please feel
free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
hearing from you soon, thank you.

sincerely,
Charles

Subject:	summer work..


Long time no see,
How have you been...must be busy and living a challenging life?
I have been pretty busy too,
to finish a project and write a paper, these days.

Everything looks going OK for my summer internship.
I took necessary steps to work out of campus, and sent
signed contract to Molly a week ago..

Here is what I am expecting to do in the summer.
Please let me know if you have any change in mind.
Actually, I wonder a little bit if DealBench changed its business model...
and maybe you got priority in something different
because it has been quite a while since we talked.
I'd like to what's going on in DealBench team...
Raghavan and Ross,
if we talk over phone it will be great!

Dr. Kaminski,
If you think there is something else interesting to work with during the
summer,
to both you and I, please let me know.
My interest is auction, market design, and simulation.
I am taking a financial engineering class, (mostly on option pricing)
and working on electricity generator valuation problem based on
spark spread option.

All of you,
Let's keep in touch until we meet in June!!

Best Regards,
Jinbaek

Hi Vince,

Thank you for your offer to bring Jacob back for another interview.  Yes, if 
it is not too much trouble, I would like to talk with him.  I was sorry I had 
to be out of town last week when he was in the office.  Thanks, just let me 
know when you would like me to be available.  

Kim.

This is a letter from one of the job applicants who works for PROS.
It seems that the system they develop for Williams
is more a scheduling system.

Would you like to ask him to come back for another interview,

Dear Vince:

It was so nice meeting and talking with you too. I did
not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in
Enron.

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I
have been working two years as Lead Scientist and
Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue
Management Inc. in Houston.

I developed and implemented the mathematical models
for Trading Optimization System and Firm
Transportation Optimization System.

The Trading Optimization System becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the
contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years.

Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management. I am
confident that I can make significant contributions to
Enron in this area.

I would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
Enron.

Sincerely Yours


Jacob

Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Vince

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing 
objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he 
didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he 
felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented 
that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

regards

Steve

I cannot interview Howard on Tue (business trip).
I think the organization is very interested in him.

I don't know what  "illicts your attention" means.

Hi Vince, I'm on vacation from Friday (today) until Tuesday. Rachel/London 
sent me this confirmation last night and think it illicts your attention- Did 
they get it right to meet you satisfaction? I hope your interview goes well 
with Howard too. It's all set.

Any feedback on the guys from Ford Credit and Citigroup/Oxford University? I 
own them outright- no other firms involved! FYI: My fees are always much less 
on these candidates (exclusive ownership by myself) as there are no middlemen 
involved from these "other firms". I luckily have been attracting very 
talented candidates with just doing business "as myself" rather than MRI. I 
am very encouraged. Please check them out, Vince... as you know- I always 
send you them first then on to my other clients -if you reject them.
Bye Vince, Thank you for the business!
Jeff

Celeste, 

I just received Datren Williams' acceptance with the following note attached:

"My graduation date (Ph.D. Candidate from LSU) is Dec. 2000.  Celeste Roberts
has informed me that I would have the option of starting work Feb. 2001.  I am
under the impression that I will start in Feb. 2001.  My offer letter has a 
start date 
of Aug. 2001.  If this is a problem, please give me a call.  
Looking forward to working at Enron.

Thanks a million,

Please let me know if he may in fact start in Feb. 2001, and if so, do you 
have
a specific date for him, or may he choose?

Thanks, Celeste,

??? ??? Dear  Tanya:
?
??? 
??? ??? It was a  great pleasure to have met you. I very much enjoyed the 
interview and your  insightfull questions.
?
??? ??? I am keenly  aware that many of the methods that I discussed with you 
yesterday are unique,  new?and not reported elsewhere. This is true both 
about the work I did in  whole yield curve interest rate pricing?as well as 
GARCH. The innovations  stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience 
that I have both in  turbulence physics as well as finance. They entailed 
considering the problem  from its raw formulation, mathematical analysis, 
physical interpretation,  taylored numerical method development, software 
writting and develoment and data  management.
?
??? ??? As to why I  have not yet published anything the answer is that the 
driver in my work has  been adding value to the business not publishing. 
Publishing is however an  option that has always been open with my former 
supervisor who is aware of the  work that I did.
?
??? ??? I not however  that these results were possible only by exploring to 
the utmost extent the  mathematics, finance, software design and data 
managemnet aspects of the  problem. Absence of any of these aspects is likely 
to cripple performance and  execution.
?
??? ??? Please recall  that as good as they were the performance measures 
that I mentioned to you were  for a single processor machine. Vastly better 
can be achieved with both soft  parallelism (multithreading) as well as hard 
parallelism (heterogenous network).  This fo course allows us to step up the 
reach of the models used.
?
??? ??? In fact I  know for a fact that better can be done than what I 
mentioned in the interview.  From work that I have been doing on the 
integration of the swaption volatility  surface on the whole yield curve 
interest rate model ITM and OTM instruments can  be included in both the 
callibration, pricing and hedging. 
?
??? ??? I look  forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the 
opportunity of us  cooperating.
?
??? ??? Best  regards
?
??? ???  Joao

Hi Molly:

Punit Rawal is a Carnegie Mellon student that Kevin Kindall and Bob Lee
interviewed back in December.  We would like to bring him in for an
interview.  He is definately a "Trading support" prospect.  

I forwarded his resume to John Lavorato back in December and inquired
as to whether he would be interested in interviewing him or not, but have
had no response, except that he has not had a chance to look at his
resume yet.

Vince originally said that either John or Gary Hickerson might be interested.
I did not send his resume to Gary, maybe you can check with him?

I am attaching the Interview request form and his resume.  Thanks!

Shirley

Vince,

Thank you very much for the follow up report.  I am sure Richard will be very enthusiastic about the opportunity to speak with you and your team.  I appreciate your help, and please feel free to contact me if you or Shirley need assistance with logistics.  

Again, thank you and I look forward to working with you again this recruiting season.

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

Thank you,

********************************************************
 spoke to Howard, he is intereste in speaking to someone higher up the
 foodchain at Enron. He got the impression that those people he met would
 report into him. He really needs to speak to someone higher up and discuss
 the roles strategic potential.

 He is interested mainly in structuring which this role is not. But he
 recognised where it might lead and this would potetially be interesting to
 him but needs to speak to someone who is involved in the strategic direction
 of enrons credit.com.

 Vuthy is aware that Enron have intimated they want to see him again. Howard
 has told me there is a lot happening for him both here and in the US. Vuthy
 will arrange to get Howard interviewed here in London early next week.

 Tks and rgds

Charlene,
I am sending you as promised the information I have about 3 of our summer 
interns.
I shall fax you this morning two additional resumes I have in hard copy.

In the case of Paulo Rocha we don't have a formal
resume, just a letter from him with the summary of his skills.

Thanks for your help. Enron desperately needs this talent.

   Hi Vince,

 I spoke with Ray again, and he seems to have the background necessary to 
work with the insurance group here.
He is not an actuary, but he can work with data.  Would you mind calling him 
on the phone sometime next week?
Please let me know what time you would call him, so I can let him know.  Once 
you speak with him, then maybe we can 
bring him down for interviews, if you think it appropriate.

His business phone number is 816 889 4417

Thanks,
 Vasant

Vasant,

I enjoyed our telephone conversation this morning.  From our conversation,
it sounds like Enron is moving out on the cutting edge of risk transfer and
insurance finance.  In my mind, there seem to be a myriad number of
interesting opportunities moving forward.  As well, I see a number of issues
that would need to be resolved.  Frankly, I find that quite exciting.  I
left academics largely because I wanted to move into a more "front line"
career. While I've enjoyed my work here at the NAIC, it is still not where I
ultimately see myself.  I gathered from your comments some concern about my
being too senior in the organization.  If I am interpreting you correctly,
you are concerned about hands on technical work.  I enjoy that immensely and
some of the strengths I bring to the table are the ability to think
creatively about solving financial problems and the the ability to make data
tell the underlying story.

I look forward to talking to you next week.  I just found out that our
office building will be closed Monday, so I will not be in until Tuesday
a.m.

Hi Amy

A colleague of mine interviewed someone last week who is a PHD whose
background is as a developer within catastrophe risk management. He is
looking to move into more of a quantitative role which will utilise his
developing  skills and also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as
well. The issue is that he is based in Chicago and I wondered if there
would be any interest from your headquarters there.

Please find attached his details.

Speak to you soon.

Regards

Simon

Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
I will forward my resume. I am looking for a  trading position. I have three 
years of market-making experience in illiquid  markets, which I beleive is 
highly relevant. But it seems now that getting out  of my contract is not an 
alternative anymore.? I learned yesterday that my  firm finally decided to 
grant me what I wanted... a new desk. Sometimes I feel  that when you become 
a trader you come to trade everything, including your  career.
?
?I thank you for your time and  consideration.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I currently hold a post-doctorate position in the Mathematics
Department at the University of Texas at Austin (with a Ph.D.
in theoretical physics). Although my position here is renewable
until summer 2001, I would like to move on to a more dynamic field
where I can still use my analytical skills and mathematical knowledge.
Since attending a series of lectures on mathematical finance given
by Dr. Marc Potters last summer I started studying the subject on my
own and found it intriguing and challenging.

I am interested in a position in your group (RAC) at Enron.
Last fall in a Career seminar at UT you mentioned that people who are
interested can send you their resume. If this is still relevant, please
find below my resume (in Word 97 and text formats).
Thank you for your time.

Yours,
Nurit Krausz

Thanks for your message.  Our e-mail system was down all day
yesterday so I was not able to respond until today.

I am very interested in coming in for an interview.  Unfortunately, my
schedule will make traveling on a weekday difficult for at least the next
two weeks.  I am travelling as part of the US delegation to the G-20 on
the 24th and 25th and will be busy until then in preparation.  Immediately
following that trip I will be moving to a new office here in Treasury and
am not sure about my schedule.

I would like to wait until next week when I have a better idea of my
schedule to propose times to come to Houston.  Please let me know if
there are time constraints on your side.

Thanks,
Mark Giancola

Good morning Mr. Giancola:

Your resume was forwarded to Vince Kaminski, Managing Director and
Head of Research with Enron.

We would like to bring you in for an informal interview at your
convenience.
This would be for a position of "Economist" or "Associate Economist",
reporting to Maureen Raymond Castaneda.

Please give me some dates and times that would be convenient with you
and I will have our HR Rep contact you to schedule your coming to
Houston.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Vince,
The following (below) is what London RW wrote back- Is it true Enron can do 
it inhouse between Houston and London?...if so, I will get Alec to have 
Howard available for you upon arrive back from his holiday for the video 
conference.
Let me know if this is what you want and ment. MRI has video conferencing 
but, not in UK...so I can't provide the service, either.
I don't want to let you down.

Hi Amy

A colleague of mine interviewed someone last week who is a PHD whose
background is as a developer within catastrophe risk management. He is
looking to move into more of a quantitative role which will utilise his
developing  skills and also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as
well. The issue is that he is based in Chicago and I wondered if there
would be any interest from your headquarters there.

Please find attached his details.

Speak to you soon.

Regards

Simon

Hi Vince, I'm on vacation from Friday (today) until Tuesday. Rachel/London 
sent me this confirmation last night and think it illicts your attention- Did 
they get it right to meet you satisfaction? I hope your interview goes well 
with Howard too. It's all set.

Any feedback on the guys from Ford Credit and Citigroup/Oxford University? I 
own them outright- no other firms involved! FYI: My fees are always much less 
on these candidates (exclusive ownership by myself) as there are no middlemen 
involved from these "other firms". I luckily have been attracting very 
talented candidates with just doing business "as myself" rather than MRI. I 
am very encouraged. Please check them out, Vince... as you know- I always 
send you them first then on to my other clients -if you reject them.
Bye Vince, Thank you for the business!
Jeff
PS- Use my cellphone if you want me (the next 4 days) for anything; I'm here 
for you- 949 813 2241

Dr . Kaminski, 


Thank you for giving me an opportunity to talk with you and Zimin.  It's my 
great pleasure to meet  with you 
and your group members.
 
I met Zimin last week. We had a wonderful talk.  After our meeting, I  handed 
in him my current resume.
He may already forwarded my resume to you.  If not, I will be very happy to 
send you a copy.

By talking with you, Zimin  and by attending your presentation yesterday at 
UH,  I find I am really interesting the 
fields that you are working on .  I am deeply impressed by the research works 
your team have done and I am 
looking forward  I am able to become one of your members.  I am also looking 
forward  to be able to do researches 
under your guidance.  

I strongly  feel that your research department  provides the kind of jobs and 
environments that I have been looking
for a long time.  My career objective matches your research fields and 
directions.  I believe my training in  mathematics
and computer science will provide me some necessary backgrounds in energy 
risk management  .  I am also sure that 
by working with you,   I can greatly expand my IT skills and experiences.  I 
also can learn tremendously from
 you and your research teams.

Currently after finishing my programing work as an IT spcialist,  I am 
reading John Hull's book and try to catch up necessary
background in Finance and related fields.  I am also readingyour "Managing 
Energy Price Risk" book.   
Thank you for giving me a copy of this book.  

Again, thank you  for giving me this opportunity and I am looking forward to 
working in your team.

John Hou

Since we were not able to connect this morning, would you identify any other
time as convenient for you?  Should I try Monday morning?

Thank you

Vince/Tanya:

I interviewed Charles today 10:30 AM. Here are my impressions:

 1) Excellent professional and managerial experience. 
 2) Very good technical background. 
  Deal Valuation and
  Model Implementation
 3) Promisses to fit very well into the group's culture. 

The only issues I see is that he would have to leave a high level position at 
his current employee.

Vince Kaminski,

I am one of the Stanford students that you interviewed last October.
I really apologize for contacting you that late, but for
some reason when I wrote the email that I transcribe below I did not send
it, and just realized about that until now.

Also, I want to thank you again for opening the
possibility of a summer internship at Enron.

Regards,

Jorge Picazo
