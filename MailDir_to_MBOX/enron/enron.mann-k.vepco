I am attaching a redline of a revised version of the document formerly known 
as the PPA.  This is compared against the August 7 draft.  

I am sending it without anyone else reading it (a gutsy and foolhardy move), 
so it is subject to further Enron review.

Thanks,

Kay

I don't know the terms under which it has been submitted by VEPCO,  but we
can certainly request that it be treated as such.

This information is helpful.  Is the draft of the PPA submitted by VEPCO
confidential?

The Application itself is public.  The testimony is public.  Without going
back through the material we have supplied (which I would be happy to do,
if
you like), the primary material that was confidential was the cost data and
supporting work papers.  Also, the engineering plan we filed recently in
response to a data request was confidential.

Let me know if you would like me to walk back through it more specifically.

Hi Allyson,

Someone was asking which of the information we have filed is public
information.  Is the petition itself public?  What else would be public?

I know this is a variation to the "what is confidential" question. Once
again, your assistance is appreciated.

Kay

I ended up staying up (must have been that last cup of coffee!) and revising 
the agreement last night.  Attached is a clean copy.  I am having my 
secretary run the blackline this am and she will email it to you (her name is 
Deborah Morris, so look for an email from her.)  IMPORTANT!-- There are 
several bracketed notes in italics that call to your attention items for your 
input.  These are intended to be removed before this goes to VEPCO!

Kay--I'll call you later today or tomorrow, after we get their changes and 
have a chance to review them.  Best regards.

In speaking with Allyson, she believes we need to have the responses the 
Public Staff's data request no later than sometime next week.  The Staff 
wants to have a meeting or conference call to discuss our responses during 
the week of August 28th.  Therefore, Allyson suggests that we have a call 
this week to discuss how and when we will pull this information together.  
Sounds like a good idea.

Please let me know when you are available for the call this week.  I suspect 
it will take between 30-45 minutes.  Also, please let me know if you have NOT 
received a copy of the data request, as these should have arrived via company 
mail.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Public Staff Data Request

Could we set up a conference call in the next day or two to go over the data
requests, establish a responsible party for putting together the information
for each question, and set a time frame for getting it in?  I am tied up
most of Thursday afternoon, but am generally available the rest of the week.

I thought I'd e:mail the revised data requests upon receipt;  if I haven't
heard from Gisele by this afternoon, I will fax them.  :Let me know if you
are interested in receiving copies of the local government resolutions.
There are no surprises; they simply adopted and signed what I drafted
without even retyping them.

Kay--here is the clean one.  A word of warning--for some reason, if you use 
"tools" "track changes" in word to mark your new changes, it will mark all 
changes going back to the original Santee Cooper form we started with for 
this.  That's why I used Comparerite.  If you don't have Comparerite (it's a 
Lexis program, I think), email the new clean version to me and I can then run 
the program and send it out for you.

I would still like to talk to you when you have a moment and find out how the 
meeting went. Thanks.

I received today notarized copies of the Resolutions of Support from the
Edgecombe County Commissioners, the City Council and Mayor, and the local
economic development organization, Carolinas Gateway.

I will file them with the Commission when we file the cost data late this
week or early next week.  That would also be a good time to file any project
updates, such as information regarding the generators.

Allyson,

We'd like to keep CPL/NCNG out of the middle for as long as possible.  I'm 
sure they already know what we are up to, but I'd rather not lay it out for 
them.  So I'd prefer if Gisele Rankin did not discuss our plans to purchase 
gas from Rocky Mount.   If she happens to run into the CPL lawyer and he asks 
her again about this, tell her to say Enron is still working on fuel supply 
alternatives.

We should start the process of annexing the land hopefully very soon.  Once 
Rocky Mount has the property annexed, they have a much stronger argument for 
serving the load and NCNG won't be able to hold us hostage to their 
uncompetitive rates.

Thanks for the heads up.

Regards,

Heather

Subject: Message from Gisele Rankin following Commission Agenda Conference


The Commission order should issue tomorrow.  The commission approved the
proposed schedule.  As I told Jeffrey a few moments ago, after the hearing,
Len Anthony, attorney for CP & L, talked to Gisele Rankin.  She e:mailed me
the following message:






Len Anthony called and said CP&L of course is interested in Enron's
certificate application, doesn't plan to oppose it, but is curious
because no one has contacted NCNG about this site and plant when you'd
think that would be an important part of Enron's bid preparation.  Do
you mind if I tell him that you plan to buy from Rocky Mt.?  Would you
rather I didn't?  He didn't ask me to call him back, but I could run
into him or talk to him about something else, at which time he might ask
me about this.  I therefore would like to know how much I should say..

Gentlemen,

I have made the revisions to paragraphs 16 and 22 as suggested.  I have also 
changed the state designation of the Tarheel notary to Texas.

If this version is acceptable, we will execute originals and forward to you.  
Do you need more than one original for the optionor?

Thank you,

Kay

Nancy,

I've made a list of the transactions I see in the VEPCO deal.  Perhaps you 
can think of more.  I would appreciate your suggestions for B & P lawyers to 
assist with these various aspects of the deal, with local counsel input as 
necessary.  Additionally, I would like to have someone in the Houston office 
involved for backup. last minute meetings, etc.

Thanks for your help.

Here's my list:
 
Power Purchase Agreement with Virgina Power (VEPCO)

Interconnection Agreement (VEPCO)

Land option/due diligence/purchase (Electicities)

Sale of land to the City of Rocky Mount (CRM)

Possible Annexation Agreement (CRM)

Payment in Lieu of Taxes Agreement (CRM)

Gas Supply Agreeement (CRM)

Land lease (CRM)

Fuel supply (oil)

EPC Contract (NEPCO or other)

Assignment of turbine contract (GE?)

Purchase of other long lead items

Permitting

Operations and Maintenance Agreement

Nancy,

As difficult as this is to believe, we have been told that VEPCO wants Enron 
to take the first crack at the interconnection agreement.  Please put this on 
your list.  I will check around here to see if there is a form we want to use 
as a starting point.

Thanks,

Attached is a further revision to the PPA,which, as always, remains subject 
to Enron's further review and comment.  Ignore the fact that the document is 
entitled "clean"; this is a blackline against the August 3 version.

Kay - I reviewed the captioned.  My only comments are - 

p. 8  - The date in 3.1(a) is July 15, 2000 - should it be 2001?

Also, on p.8, I am not sure how the 3.3 damages calculation is supposed to 
work with the LD calculation under Section 4.6.  

Interesting "reinstatement" provisions - I'd love to talk to you sometime and 
find out why! 

I assume the structure will require "hell or high water" provisions and 
"market LDs."  I saw that there are provisions "de-linking" the provision of 
power from the building or commissioning of the project - I assume Herman 
will be able to tell you if the de-linking and LDs pass muster with AA for 
purposes of "marking" the contract and getting the cash flow and earnings pop.

Thanks,


Rose

Heather:

My recommendation is that we "tighten up" tax  language in the ENA - Virginia 
Electric and Power Company ("VEPCO") Power Purchase & Sale Agreement.  Below 
please find my recommendations.  Please note that the New Tax burden is upon 
VEPCO.  This is in keeping with our standard power contracts.

- Matt
x33979

1) Replace the "Tax" definition with the following:

"Taxes"  means any or all ad valorem, property, occupation, severance, 
generation, first use, conservation, Btu or energy, transmission, utility, 
gross receipts, privilege, sales, use, consumption, excise, lease, 
transaction, and other taxes, governmental charges, licenses, fees, permits 
and assessment, or increases therein, other than taxes based on net income or 
net worth.

2) Insert definition for "New Taxes":

"New Taxes"  means (i) any Taxes enacted and effective after the Effective 
Date, including, without limitation, that portion of any Taxes or New Taxes 
that constitutes an increase, or (ii) any law, order, rule or regulation, or 
interpretation thereof, enacted and effective after the Effective Date 
resulting in the application of any Taxes to a new or different class of 
parties or transactions.

3) Replace Sec. 11.2 with the following:

Applicable Taxes  The Contract Price shall include full reimbursement for, 
and Seller is liable for and shall pay, or cause to be paid, or reimburse 
Buyer if Buyer has paid, all Taxes applicable to a Transaction arising prior 
to the Delivery Point. If Buyer is required to remit such Tax, the amount 
shall be deducted from any sums due to Seller.  Seller shall indemnify, 
defend and hold harmless Buyer from any Claims for such Taxes.  The Contract 
Price does not include reimbursement for, and Buyer is liable for and shall 
pay, cause to be paid, or reimburse Seller if Seller has paid, all Taxes 
applicable to a Transaction arising at and from the Delivery Point, including 
any Taxes imposed or collected by a taxing authority with jurisdiction over 
Buyer.  Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from any 
Claims for such Taxes. Either Party, upon written request of the other, shall 
provide a certificate of exemption or other reasonably satisfactory evidence 
of exemption if either Party is exempt from taxes, and shall use reasonable 
efforts to obtain and cooperate with obtaining any exemption from or 
reduction of any Tax.  Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to administer 
this Agreement and implement the provisions in accordance with the intent to 
minimize Taxes.  Buyer shall be responsible for all New Taxes.

Heather / Jeff:

Thanks for a copy of the draft PPA. I've addressed this to both of you as 
some of my questions are based on the interaction of the PPA vs. development 
timeline and risk. Here are my thoughts / comments:

1. The PPA is really a free option through Nov. 30th, at which time we can 
choose to exercise our position and proceed. How does this fit with our 
expectations regarding PUC approval of our CPCN (which seems to be our 
highest risk development item)? Have we gone back and submitted a 
modification to our CPCN for the 2- LM6000, and 1- SW501D5A config? 

2. Do we need to define the Facility as "dual" fuel? It will not initially be 
dual fuelled as we intend to field engineer the dual fuel capability.

3. Section 3.1 (c). This provision should acknowledge our right to sell base 
Contract Capacity (as opposed to excess) to any Person to the extent that 
VEPCO has not exercised their option to purchase such Contract Capacity. In 
other words, this section should be consistent with sales allowances to other 
Persons in Section 3.4 (b) (although that section only references energy 
sales).

4. Section 3.4. Can we sell both day ahead energy and capacity to any Person 
to the extent VEPCO does not exercise their call by providing us the notice 
contemplated in Section 3.4 (b) (the section only references an allowance for 
energy sales)?

5. Section 3.4(c) Do the "additional costs" which this section requires Buyer 
to pay (to the extent Buyer provides an intra-day notice) include 
"lost-profit" costs arising from sales of energy and capacity by Seller to 
other Persons as permitted in Section 3.4 (b)? If so, I would suggest that 
this section make a specific reference, such as "including any and all of 
Seller's lost-profit and transaction costs associated with energy and 
capacity sales to other Persons".

6. Do we have a project LLC formed which can serve as the entity signing the 
PPA? Do we think VEPCO will ask for any corp. or ENA guarantees to the extent 
we use an LLC?

 7. Have we worked with the accountants to make sure we can use MTM 
accounting given the terms of this PPA?  

Jeff: Please provide a brief development summary to the group outlining (in 
order of highest risk to lowest) the various significant development items 
we'll need to deal with for this site (i.e. zoning, groundwater supply vs. 
municipal water supply, etc.). It would be helpful if you would use the 
project development control matrix.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

You can file one at any time you have information to report, and they can be
as formal as a Commission filing or as informal as a letter to the
Commission with copies to the Public Staff.  The method would depend on what

Subject:  RE: NCNG Delivery Points

I inadvertently ended the sentence with a comma.  The point I was making
was
that if it were necessary to negotiate an additional delivery point, NCNG
would probably demand concessions such as an extension of the contract
period.  Hopefully, since we are only talking about a high pressure tap,
NCNG will have less leverage.

Jeffrey and I did talk about amending the application some time ago;  he
expressed the concern that the description of the generators might be
misleading unless either more or less data were supplied, and he suggested
describing them more generally.  I think he was confortable with the fact
that the CPCN will be reviewed by electrical engineers who understand the
generators described without the elaboration he thought necessary.

One of the problems with amending the application is that you run the risk
that the Commission will adjust the time frames for intervention, etc.,
accordingly.  If you want to revise the description of the equipment, it
would be less dangerous to file a project update.

Thank you for the email.  It seems to stop in mid sentence, so I was

We have an interest in having the application for the CPCN amended to be

have mentioned this to you before.  We would like to follow up with that

Subject:  NCNG Delivery Points

There would seem to me to be two questions--the threshold one is whether
the
site is within Rocky Mount's service territory.  If it is, then what
obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery
point.  I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my
initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount
and NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to
serve, and, although a "mutually agreeable" delivery point would have to be
negotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.

The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the
right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as
well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contract
goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into
the city, "the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such
portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes
of North Carolina. . ."  The contract further provides that absent an order
of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to
serve all end users within the "aforementioned" area--presumably referring
to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.

So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably
tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I
are
looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).

The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points of
devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement
with NCNG shall be "at the following locations and other stations added at
mutually agreeable locations in the future. . ." In the Third Amendment to
the Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and
delivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included
that  other stations may be added at "mutually agreeable locations in the
future."  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to
give in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to an
extention
of terms of the of ten years, until December 6,

subject to further discussion.

We look forward to receiving the information on the fuel arrangements, 
equipment

Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:
I haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times 
there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency 
power to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would 
want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to 
replace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get 
this agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  
I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.
Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting 
transmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its 
network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have 
to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the 
plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to 
supply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin 
Presto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's 
network transmission to delivery to third parties.
Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent 
rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While 
VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that 
you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to 
transmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only 
way to ensure deliverability to third parties.
3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an 
increase.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other 
sources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission 
and subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on 
best/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase 
daily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of 
receipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as 
non-firm.)
12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that 
has not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since 
FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant 
changes in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining 
transmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this 
contract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price 
covers that circumstance.
Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at 
most any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any 
current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will 
pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this 
contract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.

Christi--

This is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively 
early draft of the PPA.

I think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and 
do the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  
IN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up 
the regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue 
less contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at 
Rockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  

Using the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their 
gas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas 
from the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the 
NCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think 
that we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply 
working on some of the siting issues.

That being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or 
Jeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there 
are some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  

Thanks.

Lisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based 
on the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did 
encounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are 
noted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and 
are also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this 
goes to VEPCO.

Cover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be 
ENA or a special purpose company?

Definitions--  We included a defined term "Emergency Start-Up" (a start up or 
increase in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to 
include a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.

Section 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy 
charge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?

Section 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD 
will be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, 
it would be best to define "commencement of construction" to avoid 
controversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a 
placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is 
your preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific 
remedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that 
milestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would 
be a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 
days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the 
cure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?

Section 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under 
this PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement 
to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the 
Facility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take 
1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be 
pro-rated for the first year?

Section 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of 
Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the 
total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated 
that the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other 
than due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled 
maintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be 
available.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated 
that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why 
wouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we 
included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during 
peak periods.

Section 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of 
Energy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we 
allow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?

Section 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.

Section 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?

Article 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not 
have any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do 
you want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for 
now?

Section 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or 
would you prefer a shorter period?

Article 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step 
prior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is 
"baseball" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's 
position or the other's.  Is that what you want?

Section 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it 
will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not 
recommend Virginia law for this contract.

Exhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please 
see the bracketed notes therein.

Please call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.

Kay and Reagan,

We have an opportunity (VERY, VERY preliminary) to supply full requirements 
to a co-op that is breaking away from Old Dominion Electric Cooperative 
(ODEC) that is located in VEPCO's territory.  They have about 500 MW peak 
load and 200 MW of resources, everything else is covered by VEPCO.

If we got back our queue spot, we could build our peaker (within VEPCO's 
territory) to meet this load.

Kay, what is your opinion on the strength of our argument with VEPCO?  We may 
have a new deal that makes building the peaker viable again and so we may 
want to push them on it.

Doctor, do we have a pulse?  It may be the death of me, but we're going to 
build that peaker!

Subject: VEPCO Interconnect

Kay,

As we evaluate the viability of pushing VEPCO for reinstatement of our queue 
spot, a legal interpretation and opinion is needed.  VEPCO Capacity 
Acquisition withdrew us from the queue once the PPA negotiations were 
terminated eventhough we had a written agreement to do the interconnect 
study.  We want the queue spot back and are evaluating how hard to push.  As 
soon as we get it back, however, we will be pressed to specify equipment for 
the next phase of the interconnect study.

Keeping in mind that a "material change" would again jeopardize the queue 
position AND knowing that there is a high probability that the equipment 
configuration will change, the question is.......legally, how much room do we 
have under their tariff to make changes without being "material"?   In other 
words, if we change equipment configuration while keeping the MWs roughly the 
same (around 250 MW), is this a "material change" causing us to forfeit the 
queue anyway?

The web site ( http://www.dom.com/operations/elec-transmission/gi-main.html ) 
has the filings for interconnect procedures.  Can you give an opinion?

Thanks for your help,

Reagan

The Commission issued its procedural order, as expected, on August 2.  It
reads just like the draft, except that the Commission did not include the
date for proposed orders that we requested.  We can still make that request
at the evidentiary hearing.

The public and evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin
Monday, October 2, 2000 at 2:00 pm
Petitions to intervene are due by September 8;
intervenor testimony by September 15;
ENA rebuttal by September 27.

CP & L vigorously opposed the interventions in its merger and holding
company documents;  we are going through those filings and roughing out an
opposition to its intervention here should it decide to do so.  I am
checking with the Public Staff on the status of their discovery requests.

Kay and Heather:  Apparently the copy I emailed to you last night contained 
old text ((not shown as blacklining) that went all the way back to the Santee 
Cooper form of contract even though when I open it on our system here and 
print it out here, it shows up perfectly fine and without any of the old 
text.  I've tried saving the clean version to the system again and have 
attached it.  Heather, please check the sections you noticed before and see 
if they are okay this time. If not, I'll try to get one of our Word "experts" 
(to the extent anyone is!) to work on it and will fax it to you to use in the 
interim.  Please delete the one sent to you yesterday.

There would seem to me to be two questions--the threshold one is whether the
site is within Rocky Mount's service territory.  If it is, then what
obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery
point.  I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my
initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount
and NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to
serve, and, although a "mutually agreeable" delivery point would have to be
negotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.

The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the
right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as
well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contract
goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into
the city, "the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such
portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes
of North Carolina. . ."  The contract further provides that absent an order
of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to
serve all end users within the "aforementioned" area--presumably referring
to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.

So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably
tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I are
looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).

The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points of
devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement
with NCNG shall be "at the following locations and other stations added at
mutually agreeable locations in the future. . ." In the Third Amendment to
the Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and
delivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included
that  other stations may be added at "mutually agreeable locations in the
future."  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to
give in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to an extention
of terms of the of ten years, until December 6,

 Attached is a copy of the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement on which I have 
made certain changes and included comments in bracketed notes.  (Most of the 
notes could be included in a mark-up sent back to VEPCO; there is one marked 
"Note to Enron" that is intended to be deleted before we send this out.)

The Agreement, as might be expected, is very  one-sided and is written 
primarily for their protection.  It is also very repetitive in places, 
although I did not attempt to eliminate the repetition on the theory that the 
fewer changes we propose the better and we can probably live with the 
repetition.  There are several provisions or concepts I would like to suggest 
we include from the form I had prepared a couple of weeks ago (which was 
based on the EPSA model form, and was clearly more favorable to the 
generation owner than VEPCO's form.)  I have not yet included these changes, 
as I thought we should discuss them first and decide how best to proceed on 
this draft.  Those provisions are as follows (section references are to the 
draft I prepared):

2.43.  Right to tell VEPCO to suspend or terminate work on interconnection 
facilities.

2.4.4  Requirement for Vepco to provide status reports on progress of 
construction of interconnection facilities.

2.5.2 (maybe)  Agreement to start work on facilities before all studies 
complete, if generator owner willing to bear risk of extra costs.

2.7.1 Undertaking by Vepco to use reasonable efforts to complete on schedule 
(actually, if 4.2.2 is used, this section probably should not be used.)

3.11.3 (last sentence)  Vepco liable for costs for modifications to 
generator-owned interconnection facilities and the Facility if changes 
required because of changes to Vepco facilities (unless required by law).

4.1 Vepco must inform generator owner if costs exceed estimate by more than 
10% and such increase is subject to generator owner's consent.

4.2.2 Concept that Vepco must seek bids for the work and generator owner can 
choose whether the work is done with best efforts undertaking to complete on 
time, but no penalties/incentives or with firm completion date and 
penalties/incentives.

4.3  Generator owner to provide letter of credit for cost of work or 
guarantee (as opposed to 50% paid in advance, as provided in Vepco's draft.  
By the way, even if we agreed to pay 50% in advance, it should not be on 
signing the agreement, but rather before they start the work.)

4.8.1  Refund if Vepco receives money back.

4.9.1  Language re tax gross up (in lieu of the last sentence in their 
Section 7.3.)

5.1  Last sentence--add generator owner's schedules and output,etc. being 
confidential.


In addition, there were a few things in the draft I wanted to point out, as 
follows:

In Section 2.2.3 and elsewhere in the agreement, they reserve the right to 
make a unilateral filing with FERC to amend the agreement.  The generator 
owner would have the right to protest the filing, but I want to check with 
our regulatory people as to whether they can waive this right, as I don't 
think it's fair for them to unilaterally amend it.

Article 4.6 should be reviewed by technical folks.

In Section 10.2.1.3, they reserve the right to file the agreement with FERC 
even if the parties haven't agreed and executed it yet and they start service 
under the agreement.  As noted above, it's putting your fate in FERC's hands.

The indemnity of Vepco's employees and waiver of the protection of worker's 
comp laws in Section 10.5.1 (and the reciprocal in 10.5.2) seemed strange to 
me and I was wondering if you could run this past your risk management people.

I look forward to discussing this with you further.

I am forwarding the text of a response I received from Gisele Rankin,
attorney for the Publilc Staff, to my inquiry regarding the security of
information submitted to the Commission under seal.  It largely tracks our
understanding and analysis.  The following are her words:

"To my knowledge, no one has challenged anything filed with the
Commission under seal pursuant to the trade secret statute.  Under that
statute, if you want the information claimed to be a trade secret, you
have to go to court and carry the burden (and my recollection from
reading the statute is that it is a very high burden).  The only other
way it could be made public would be for the Commission to order it to
be made public (because it isn't a trade secret), which to my knowledge
has never happened with anything even remotely of commercial value and
even then the owner of the information could go to court to stop it.
Costs related to generation are the most obviously "trade secret" type
information with which we deal. None of the utilities would try to claim
it isn't protected, because then they would have to reveal their
information.  CUCA could try to get it in order to participate in the
hearing, but CUCA generally supports IPP development (in general), and
Jamie would have to sign a nondisclosure agreement and not reveal the
information to anyone.  For all practical purposes, Enron is safe.
(Even if a claim were made, Enron could tie it up until the information
was so old it was worth much less, if anything.)"

Not everything in the data request responses was confidential--some of it is
public by nature.  For example, we were asked for material from the Form 10Q
which is filed with the SEC and is a public document.  It is my recollection
that the data regarding turbine configuration and the noise footprint, for
example, were not treated confidentiality.

The things that were submitted under seal primarily dealt with cost
information;  I do recall that we submitted the portions of the turbine
contract documents under seal.  As a practical matter, the Public Staff is
the only entity which has requested the information, and will not
disseminate it, particularly over our objections.  A problem would only
arise if the same discovery was sought by another party, which is unlikely
at this point, and which could be objected to.

One more thing.  Did someone send you copies of equipment contracts?  Those
have confidentiality provisions which need to be considered.  Therefore,
please advise what you received from Enron in that regard.

I was under the impression that most of what we were submitting we were
submitting as confidential information, specifically including the
responses to the Public Staff's data requests.  I don't recall the
specifics at this point.

Thanks again,

The Application itself is public.  The testimony is public.  Without going
back through the material we have supplied (which I would be happy to do,
if
you like), the primary material that was confidential was the cost data and
supporting work papers.  Also, the engineering plan we filed recently in
response to a data request was confidential.

Let me know if you would like me to walk back through it more specifically.

Hi Allyson,

Someone was asking which of the information we have filed is public
information.  Is the petition itself public?  What else would be public?

I know this is a variation to the "what is confidential" question. Once
again, your assistance is appreciated.

1. Term.  What will we accept?

3. Our position is that Contract Capacity set at contract signing, then=20

after that time: ditto for the demand charge.  What is the right number for=

the Capacity?  Is there a benefit to Enron to have a correction curve exhib=
it?

4. Failure to complete facility suggested as a termination event.  Is=20

5. We need to be able to supply from either or both sources (market and=20

6. Note the Start Up definition (as suggested by VEPCO) and how it is=20

7. Note: construction of the facility now required (2.3).=20

8. Define commercial operation.

9. Confirm that Enron has sufficient protection from interconnection=20
failures/delays.

10. Day ahead scheduling (3.4)  Are we ready to commit?

11. Number of start ups. (2.3 e)

I spoke with Wayne Duman last Thursday (9/21/00) to schedule a Enron VEPCO 
meeting for September 29, 2000 to discuss VEPCO progress with the Facility 
Study and processing/negotiating the Interconnect Agreement.  Wayne cancelled 
that meeting later that same afternoon.  I spoke with him today in regarding 
the reasons for cancellation.  

As it turns out, his group--Bulk Power Delivery--is not the group executing 
the PPA with Enron.  That group is Tim Talmadge's group--Capacity 
Acquisition.  Once Wayne tried to schedule the 9/29 meeting, he was told not 
to talk with Enron.  Further investigation on his part uncovered some 
internal VEPCO issues.  He is calling an internal meeting with Capacity 
Acquisition, Bulk Power Delivery, Bulk Power Operations and the Transmission 
Group to discuss these issues and establish a consistent "game plan" for 
going forward.

The Transmission Group is scheduled to finish the Facility Study on Monday, 
October 2, 2000.  The study will include switchyard needs, network needs, 
construction costs, and construction schedule.  He knows we have a June 2001 
commercial operation date, and he knows that Capacity Acquisition is 
responsible for the associated construction costs.  He is nervous that the 
Facility Study will forecast construction schedules that do not coincide with 
the commercial operation date.  He further indicated that acquisition of 
necessary equipment--breakers, transformers, etc. specified by the Facility 
Study--could be a significant challenge for VEPCO.  He understands that this 
is his challenge, not ours.  He also noted that VEPCO is very sensitive and 
careful to operate within FERC guidelines regarding interconnection and the 
various time frames--this includes not making any special considerations to 
the Capacity Acquisition guys since they are in the same company.

Wayne Duman is very involved in VEPCO's effort to develop an Interconnection 
Agreement consistent with FERC.  They are within days of completing this 
task--it is in legal review right now.  The current  version of the 
Interconnection Agreement is a subsequent generation of the document we 
reviewed at the beginning of August.  Wayne understands that the PPA which 
VEPCO and Enron are negotiating is contardictory to the "boiler plate" 
Interconnection Agreement and needs to be changed to reflect the PPA defined 
scopes for Enron and VEPCO.  He indicated that part of VEPCO's "to do list" 
to get ready to meet with Enron includes modification of the latest 
generation of the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement to be consistent with the 
Enron PPA.

He is optimistic that we would be able to meet late next week to get the 
Interconnect Agreement process underway.  He assured me that he would keep 
Enron informed of the progress.

In summary, VEPCO is doing the following:
getting all stakeholders on the same page,
finishing the Facility Study, and
getting their Interconnection Agreement to agree with the PPA.

Here's another draft:



Note in particular changes in exclusivity (now bilateral), tax abatement 
(exh. A), termination rights, term.  I also made a minor change to dispute 
resolution.  As for their hesitancy to give us trade secrets, these should be 
covered by the confidentiality provisions, although this version is very 
basic (see underlined language).  I just want to make sure we get the gas 
supply contract ASAP. We can do a full blown confidentiality agreement that 
helps.  

I never heard back from Dutch Bumgardner.  I'll get the interconnection 
agreement started on this end, unless you think otherwise.

Hope you are having a good trip.

Kay

Jeffrey, after our discussion yesterday regarding the descriptions of the
particular generators in the CPCN application, I had a discussion with Tom
Lam, one of the Public Staff engineers, regarding your concerns.  As I had
suggested, they understand what the reference to the 188 MW encompasses.
Also, there would be no problem with substituting different generator sets
for the LM 6000s if there is an economy/efficiency basis for it and
reliability is not impaired.

He went on to say that he saw no problem with the CPCN Application from an
engineering perspective.  As far as the engineers are concerned, North
Carolina Power needs the power and they are pleased that the generation is
going to be built in North Carolina.  He expects the bulk of the questions
regarding the project to come from the Accounting Division, and most of
those will be directed to North Carolina Power and to be focused on the RFP
process.

The Public Staff has three divisions that investigate and analyze
applications--Engineering, Accounting and Economic Research.  Typically,
each section sends out separate data requests.  I will be calling around
over the next two or three days to see what questions might be surfacing
from the other divisions.

Karla, John, and Jim,

It was good meeting with you at your offices last week.  Attached is a draft proposal highlighting the new structure we had agreed upon during our discussions.  Please review the proposal and comment as necessary, as agreeing upon a common premise will help us move forward more efficiently.  We will be meeting again later this week to discuss the various options that are available, and would appreciate your feedback with respect to specific structures, definitions, etc. you may have in mind (and that we may not have captured here).

Feel free to call either Heather or myself with questions or ideas at anytime.


 

Look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Rahil

Sorry, I made an error in the last example for the FOR calculation.  This one
