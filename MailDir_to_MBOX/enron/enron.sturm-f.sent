Subject: PLEASE NOTE THAT THE DATE FOR THE 1ST MEETING IS JANUARY 16

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

Dale,

The product that crosses monthly and daily swaps is the IF vs GD index swap 
that we currently offer.  I'll call you later...no time right now to write 
more.

John,

The new products have been built and are in the process of being mapped to 
Sitara and Tagg.  I'm working with Melba Lozano (EOL contact) and she tells 
me they should be ready tomorrow.

Mark Taylor and I haven't spoken yet about simplifying the language in the 
product long description, so I'll try to get with him tomorrow.  For now, 
we're staying with the existing language which isn't really that bad.

Any of these products which are intra-month will stay in the swap filter as 
US GAS DAILY products, but longer than intra-month will be in the basis 
filter as US GAS BASIS products with the format:

  US GAS BASIS      GD/D SoCal - HHub

The only product that will be different is the Nymex to daily swap which will 
be:

  US GAS BASIS      NXL1 - GD/D HHub

Any questions or comments,

Fletch

Dave,

John Lavorato would like me to get back with him regarding exactly why we 
can't send out a pop-up window to advertise the new power products that we're 
launching this week.  Could you call or e-mail back?  He basically said he 
wants to do one, but I don't want to if it could crash all of EOL on our 
behalf.  Let me know.  Thanks,

Fletch

Frank,

This guy called me because he read the book I wrote about Natural Gas.  He 
has some kind of special treatment with the federal government in terms of 
gas purchases.  Sounds like a minority owned business to me.  Could you call 
him or refer him to someone at EES?  Thanks,  Fletch Sturm

This guy is a friend of mine and he said he'll put in some good words about 
EOL and especially the new product that we're going to launch.  His name is 
Chris McDonald at Southern  (678) 579-3298.  He runs the West gas trading at 
Southern.

Brad,

(see message below from Melba)

Which one should we use, and how should it look on the website?  Remember, 
only five characters will fit in the name.  Maybe just CNGNo?
Let me know and i'll forward to Melba.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Jeff,

Below is a list of items I'd like to discuss with you when we both have 
time(?).  I just wanted to brief you first.

I'm thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from 
8:15 - 8:30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk 
meetings.  This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since 
changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be 
fresh in everyone's mind.  Would it be okay to delay EOL market-making in 
basis until 8:30?  I think it would be worth it.
I think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups 
(origination (who?), structuring (who?), Julie Gomez, and Fred Lagrasta) on a 
regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ENA's 
basis positions.  Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to 
involve and maybe notify them of my intentions?
Should we set up a new book (under my management) which would hold certain 
strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured 
positions?  I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being 
"cluttered up" in different books (i.e.  the P/L from these trades would be 
my focus instead of managed by other traders.)  
Do you think the traders could eventually report directly to me?  It seems 
like more intense leadership might provide an extra push to the group.

Talk to you soon,

Fletch

Eric,

Jeff,

Thanks for inviting me to be in the Round Table.  I think it'll be a 
success.  I'm able to make it to dinner tomorrow night for the Tiger Team 
deal.

Fletch

p.s.  did you close on your house yet?

Melba,

The description you sent to me yesterday seems a little confusing...How about 
the following:

 Floating price A: Gas Daily midpoint for Henry Hub
 
 Floating price B: Gas Daily midpoint for __________

 Buyer pays Floating price A plus applicable basis, seller pays Floating 
price B


We should substitute your long description for "Gas Daily midpoint" above.  
Run this by everyone ASAP so we can activate these products.

Jenny,

Thanks for the response.  I was under the impression that what you and I had 
worked out was more of a temporary fix and that there was another group 
working on a perrmanent solution for all of us.  I'm still obviously trading 
options, but would like you or JP or someone else in risk run a standard 
report for me each morning which shows my net delta positions by month and 
the subsequent gamma positions for certain $ moves in the underlying.  I 
could have Peter do it at night if it needs to be done before calc.  Just let 
me know.  Thanks,

Fletch

p.s.  sorry if it seems like this is being blown out of proportion

good morning!

just wondering if you've talked to Gas Daily yet and if you need anything 
more from me...also, i'd like to see what you're going to give to them (G.D.) 
with regard to facts about the products, EOL, etc...  we'd like to launch the 
products on Fri and have the article appear on Mon because the audience 
should be bigger than Fri.

Eric,

The name I have at El Paso is Tim Bourne 713-420-3826.  Todd Geiger is my 
contact over there.  He's a Vice President and told me that Tim runs the 
trading group and would not be in the office until Mon. next week.

jenny,
i'd really like to be able to set my curves through Dec '03 without having to 
freak with that g.d. contango weighting table in the MW4 file.  the market 
changes so fast during the day that i don't have time to switch between my 
MWSum and MW4 files fast enough to keep up with it.  i have a section in the 
MWSum spreadsheet where i keep all of the quick calcs on the calendars, so i 
could link that to the MW4 file like i'm doing through Oct '02.  come by 
tomorrow (Fri) and i'll show you what the h i'm talking about.

That's a great product with a simple explanation.  I have blank deal tickets

Eric,

The products have been launched (Mon) and did trade a couple times.  As far 
as another article in GD, i'll check with John, but I think it's a good idea.

Sorry I haven't checked my e-mail in a while, but that's trading...I'm more

Sheri,

Robyn Menear is my new assistant on the FT-Central book.  I'd like to have 
her set up to use EOL stack manager, product manager, and transact on the 
website.  I believe she already has a login ID for the website, but I don't 
know about the others.  In addition, her trades (stack manager customer 
trades, and her own website trades) need to go into my book (FT-Central).  If 
you need me to do anything else in order for this to happen, let me know.

Thanks,

Fletcher Sturm

Douglas,

Thanks for your interest...My book does go into some option detail (not 
really collars since they're a combination of the tools I discuss) and plenty 
of swap transactions.  Obviously, I think you would gain some insight for 
both your personal and professional interests if you go through it.  Thanks 
again,

Fletcher Sturm

Sorry, but I've been out of town since you sent this.  There have been a 
couple of errors pointed out to me since the publishing, most of which have 
apparently been somewhat obvious (i.e. not difficult to figure out).  I'll 
look into this one and get back to you.

Fletcher Sturm

p.s.  Thanks for your support!

There will be a Trader's Roundtable meeting every Tuesday at 4:00PM in 
EB3321.  

First Message that was sent out:
As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

Subject: Tiger Team meeting Jeff Shankman's office

I would like to invite you to a meeting with Jeff Shankman on Tuesday
January 16, 3:30 p.m.  at Jeff Shankman's office.

We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20 
Wharton School
students visiting Enron.  A Wharton  tiger team works through a semester on a 
special project, proposed by
a corporation. The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the 
impact of
electronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will  
result in a report that
will be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation. I hope that  you will 
find this report useful.

 We have invited our tiger team to visit Enron. The students will arrive on 
Thursday, 
January 18, and will spend Friday at Enron. I would appreciate if you could 
find 30 minutes
on Friday to talk to the students.

The meeting with Jeff on Tuesday  should not last longer than 10-15 minutes.

Vince

Melba,

I'm sorry I haven't replied sooner, but there is a decision to be made about 
what type of product these should fall under...Gas Daily, or Basis.  We're 
afraid that if we categorize them as Gas Daily, then anyone who logs onto the 
site looking for basis would miss these products altogether.  The "US GAS 
DAILY  HeHub - CHIC" is cleary the best description for the website.  I'll 
get back to you as soon as we make a decision.

I mentioned an idea to Jeff Shankman the other day about providing some

you.  He said you were already working on some additions to the website.  I 
would really like to participate in the development of these tools, so please

Jeff,

With little physical knowledge of the transmission and generation 
constraints, etc., it's going to be difficult for me to say, geographically, 
where I think the boundaries ought to be.  However, I think the market would 
always prefer a simple layout, something like MISO - West, - Central, - East, 
- South.  To me, I think that would cover the basic areas that trade 
differently in terms of price.

What do I do with this now?  How do I get the $50?  Can I wait and get a

Under the alternative "bumping" method, if the market is 3.75/5.25 and our 
EOL and ICE market's are both 4/5 in that case, would we pay brokerage if 
someone executes on ICE rather than EOL?

Greg,

I've been working with an IT guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for 
some of us that can receive live prices from EOL.  I've used this to build a 
real-time matrix which shows spread relationships between different gas 
locations, including variable cost analysis, NPV, etc.  I think that this 
would be an extremely useful application to include on the EOL site, whether 
it is in Excel format or some homemade format.  For example, Hunter and I 
were in Chicago last week talking to NICOR about analyzing the risk 
components of their PBR.  We brought up this idea and they were excited about 
being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads, hedge MTD and BOM PBR 
price with Gas Daily swaps, storage utilization logic, etc.

If we can develop an EOL - dependent application that is helpful to our 
customers in terms of how they make trading decisions, it will reinforce the 
importance of using our site over our competitors.

Let me know what you think!

Greg,

Check out a company called Opus 360 for recruiting IT people 
(www.opus360.com).  It might be a good investment for the equity group too 
(OPUS).
