Brenda was able to obtain a copy of the CES Egan storage contract.  We don't 
have a copy of the letter assigning the contract to ENA though.  We do have 
copies of the invoices for Jan and Feb.  The invoices are addressed to ENA 
which is good enough for me.

I am going to set the contract up as an ENA contract effective Jan 1, unless 
someone has an objection.  Brenda will give a copy of the contract to 
Sylvia.  

Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that.  Also, 
the contract has an evergreen provision but I don't think we should set it up 
that way.
Let me know if you have questions.

thanks

Secondary non-recallable, you can use $.14 year round

OR

$.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter.

The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in.

I
need Apr-Oct '00 and Nov-Mar for deliveries to COH. assume 10,000/d of
secondary for summer and 20,000/d for winter. Please call if you have
questions.

Subject:  upgrade

NOTICE TO ALL SHIPPERS:

There will be a mandatory E-SCRIPT upgrade on Tuesday, February 8, 2000.

This upgrade will take approximately 45 min. to download via the Internet
using a 33.6 Kb modem connection (which is typical for dialup customers).
Please note that Altra customers will require additional time to upgrade.
If you prefer, you may call the E-SCRIPT Help Line at 1-800-895-8899 to 
request
software for this upgrade. We will need you to leave your company
name, contact person, mailing address and whether you need a set of diskettes
or a CD.

The upgrade will include the following E-SCRIPT modification:

Users will be able to enter volumes in Nominations via the Daily Volumes Tab
for nominations in normal mode.  This will allow nominations for different 
days
of the month on an activity, rather than 'retrieving' data for each day from 
the
main tab.

As always, please call the E-SCRIPT Help Line with any problems, questions
or suggestions.

Thank you,

Twyla Strogen
Manager, Business Technology Services

The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for  5/31 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\JUN_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':

Please note that for the month of June '00 CES is purchasing additional 
volumes
of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate deal.  The
volumes shown here are entirely separate from the aforementioned deal.

Yes, CES Retail did take this gas for Jan, Feb & March.  The Canonsburg 
office was responsible for the noms.  
 Yes, the deal needs to be input into Sitata.  Maybe, Terry can input.  Wade 
has copies of the monthly invoices from T & F Operating for all three months.

Deal details:
Volume = 10,000 MCF per month
Price for Jan, Feb & Mar = $3.465 / MCF
I would not worry about the Mcf issue here.  Just put the volumes and price 
in and pay the bill.
John

T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to 
terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question.

FYI-
Dick successfully traded 5000 of Columbia Gas Transmission Capacity for 12/00 
with Dynegy.  
I posted the release without any problems.
Thanks for getting pipeline capacity setup as a product on EOL.

Occasionally, when I have a question, I call my little EES buddies to get a 
better understanding of a specific LDC.  I don't mention CES and I assume

Hey Jennifer and Dale,
I checked with Scott Neal and Dick Jenkins and they're on board with having 
all 4 trading locations available for our customers starting April on EOL (if 
possible with you guys of course).  The 2 existing locations are CNG SABINE 
NORTH POINT & CNG SABINE SOUTH POINT and the two new proposed locations will 
be CNG TRANSMISSION TTT SOUTH POOL & CNG TRANSMISSION TTT NORTH POOL.   There 
may be some confusion among our EOL customers with the similar names to these 
points so we have to be careful how we differentiate the names of the 4 
points.    The Enron trader responsible for the 2 new CNG Transmission 
locations will be Scott Hendrickson.  The business systems director at CNG  
Transmission who requested this of me is Iris King.  Her phone number is 
304-623-8213 and her e-mail is iris_g._king@cngt.cng.com.  She is also 
onboard with having the locations available to trade on EOL as soon as 
possible.

If I can provide any more info.to you, please let me know.   THANKS AGAIN IN 
ADVANCE!!!!!!

Thanks for the information. It is good to know people outside of the company

Can you let me know which trader will be trading this location? Dale Neuner,

Hey Jennifer,  How are you?

We had a meeting with CNG Transmission today.  They have rolled out a new 
pooling service for their customers called CNG Transmission North pool and 
CNG Transmission South pool.  It's different than CNG South Point and CNG 
North Point.  These last two pertain to CNG Sabine Hub Services.  As they 
have presented these new services to their customers, all of their customers 
are inquiring as to whether or not EOL will be trading these two new 
locations in the future.  These new services on CNG Transmission have the 
benefit over CNG Sabine Hub Services pools of being free for the time being 
(until October at least)....How do we go about adding these two new trading 
locations on EOL.  Volumes can be transferred from CNG Sabine Hub Services 
points over to CNG Transmission pools at no cost and we are actually starting 
to set up our supplies and markets in this manner to save on pooling costs 
for April.   I have a contact that you can talk to at CNG Transmission if you 
would like.. Please let me know and thanks in advance!!!!

I think everything is OK now.  I set up deals 260724 (k#B00693026471), 260689 
(k# F01978) and deal 260712 (k#I00454).  I changed the end date for deal 
235701 (also k#B00693026471 - unpathed) to 4/30/00 and it still shows up in 
Unify for May.

Beavy, make sure you use the B*** k# with an MDQ of 9005 when you path May.

I was under the impression that the new services were set up by Sylvia.  She 
had discussed this several times with me in the last two weeks.  You should 
only have to set up new deal tickets with the new service effective 5-1-00 
and end the old tickets 4-30-00.
The new service types should be as the below example - The new service type 
is no longer "Transportation", it is now "Transportation-Pathed" for K#

I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this.  Originally they wanted to 
do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then 
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a 
different service type (so as not to change historically).  To my 
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was 
cleared with Connie Sutton.  So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify 
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting 
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in 
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type 
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production 
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the 
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't 
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the 
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream 
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

When CES runs out of transport and takes more than their "their first of the 
month" volume on any given day, the price is GD App + $.06 + FT variable 
cost.  This works real well with Scott's $.05 IT discount.   

What I don't know about is the Aristech capacity, does that belong to CES or 
ENA for May?  I apologize upfront if someone has already responded.

Subject: CES contract - Choice Demand Swings in April 2000 - PLEASE READ

Colleen need your help with this one. Choice is having huge temperature 
swings causing drastic demand changes. Also, the new Choice SST contract mdq 
was reduced from 134,000 to 54,000 in April. There are several cold days that 
are causing ENA to service Choice via IT ($0.05/dkt) and Contract Overruns 
($0.21/dkt).
Do these charges get passed back to CES?

The TCO schedulers are trying to be proactive, by looking at Intraday Temps. 
Unfortunately, we are having a hard time estimating the actual burn. The CDC 
posts a forecast, one day before gas flow. CDC does not post intraday temps, 
we look at the National Weather Service. CDC only posts actuals, once the gas 
day is ended. Once the gas day is ended, TCO and CDC only allow adjustments 
on the SST contract as a no-notice storage withdrawal adjustment. Because the 
burns are increasing during the cold periods, we are overrunning the 
contracts.

Just want to ensure everyone is on the same page before ENA receives TCO's 
April bill, and CES receives ENA's April bill. I have not discussed this with 
CES yet, wanted to ensure ENA is on the same page.

So far this month:

4/4 IT = 25,589 Overrun = 6000
4/8 IT = 22,226 Overrun = 8000
4/9 IT = 12,404 Overrun = waiting on actuals
4/10 IT = 8,200 Overrun = waiting on actuals

Accumulated Estimated Cost

IT = $3421 Overrun = $2940

There was another suggestion to use the Idle transport for Hopewell and Calp. 
At this time, I strongly advise not using the swing transport. If Hopewell 
and Calp come up... it is usually late intraday... and does not give us 
enough time to switch the transport with the CDC's. The penalty for Choice 
gas not showing up is $25/dkt and getting kicked out of the Choice program. 
The CDC's do not accept retro's for Choice gas. Believe me... I have tried 
several times!!!! Usually CES has enough behind the citygate pool gas to help 
balance for minor differences (under 100 dkt). Also, TCO is not as friendly 
as they used to be in doing retro's for Choice gas.

Thank you for your help.

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

Thanks for the info!  Do you know what the key is to make sure the tickets 
show up in Unify on the right desk?  Also how do we assure flash is on right 
desk or is this not going to be an issue if we are using the Service P & l to 
flash?  If we use the Service P & L to flash, will the transport info in 
Unify and the flash amts. be the same and on the same desk?  How this makes 
sense!

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.

Joanne- do you have any upstream contracts for CVA or CMD?

As for CPA, we have bought 3,942 at Broadrun Cobb from East Ohio Gas K#34826. 
We will buy 2,821(FOM) from you at the pool plus we plan to  buy  6,061 at 
A06. Nothing at A05 for Mar01.

So of the 15,553 FOM gas (Ex1 plus hedges @ CG) we will use 2,759 CPA, 1,200 
CVA and 472 CMD. The remaining 11,122 (or 11,370 @ pool) will be pulled into 
NPC App Pool from ENA App Pool. 

I will let you know A06 assoonasigetit.

Contract 62039 was replace with contract 65402.  It's 20,000 day with a 
primary receipt of Maumee and a primary delivery of COH.  The term is 11/1/99 
- 10/31/2000.  Should I bill the retail group for this contract or does this 
belong to wholesale??  Also, I'm showing a demand charge of $.15.

CBE, Inc is cancelling their contract with ENA for Meter 11480 Equitrans 
production effective July 1, 2000.

The only production which we have for July forward should be:
 1.  Braxton Oil & Gas
 2.  Bill Kennedy
 3.  Aurora
I do not want to cancel their contracts untill we are sure that we do not owe 
Equitrans for any past negative imbalances.

Cindi, when you nom for July, let me know the volume and I will try to sell 
the gas to Dominion.

John

I heard from Algon yesterday on those contracts I said not to pay.  We made a 
mistake releasing the capacity so ENA will be responsible for the charges.  I 
do not want to bill CES for these charges since we made the mistake.  This 
should only be a problem for May and June, I think.

Please pay the disputed amounts.

Some questions about the 1st.

Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.  You are 
showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.  AND I see a citygate load of 29,461 
dt/day.

This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.  Is this to reduce 
the citygate load or is this additional New Power supply?

I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on 
CGAS.  I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco.  He does not have a 
navigator ID and password.  This will be the only CGAS activity he has and he 
has not bought any gas for Nov either.  I think he needs someone to handle 
this for him.

Is this the type of thing we can pass on to EES?

Good job Chris.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  

Comments?

Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

Deal 150348.  I have it in Sitara as  833 day for the 15th-31st.  This deal 
is secondary recallable, which means the gas don't flow if secondary 
transport gets cut.

I met with Jeff Kiester of DTI yesterday regarding the storage offering they 
have on the market.  They have 3 Bcf storage capacity and 30,000dt/d of 
FT-GSS up for bid by 2/12/01. However there will be up to an additional 10 
Bcf of storage capcity available before 4/1/01 depending on additional 
turnback.  All of this capacity is utility turnback mainly, East Ohio, 
National Fuel and RG&E.
Potential uses for DTI storage:
1.  Desk use - If we buy the storage without the transportation we would 
inject and withdraw at SP.  If we do submit a bid, I would recommend that we 
try to incorporate free intramonth injection capability, effectivly giving us 
a no-notice type service that we could use to take physical positions in the 
cash market.  The current park/loan rate is $0.07 /dt/d, it seems we utilize 
this 2-3 times a month.
2.  VNG - AGL could want to look into adding storage to the VNG portfolio,  
the drawback is that the PL1 line has no excess deliverability, VNG's need is 
more a peak day issue.
3.  Partner with EES - Paul Tate from EES also sat in on our meeting, he 
expressed an interest in looking into potential partnering oppourtunities 
with the East desk regarding markets on TCO and DTI.  This storage offering 
for example could be something we partner on.  I plan to meet with Paul at 
the beggining of next week to discuss further (Dick I will check with you on 
your availability).

Jeff also indicated there will be more transportation capacity turned back in 
the near future.  There will be a posting for 75,000 dt/d of Lebanon - Leidy 
capacity coming out in the next few weeks.  

Market view on capacity release:
With the utilities turning back transportation, the economics of the capacity 
release market will change.  The utilities have historically released 
transportation in the summer months for $0.05 or less (as low as $0.01) in 
order to recover something from their asset.  DTI will now be the marketer of 
the turned back capacity.  Historically the pipeline has been very reluctant 
to sell capacity below max rate in the winter and less than 50% ($0.12 at 
current rates) in the summer.   Jeff indicated that his view is that capacity 
values will increase slighly this summer and significantly next summer due to 
the new power gen load coming online 2002.  As part of DTI's last rate case 
settlement FT-GSS holders can no longer release transportation in the summer, 
that went into effect last summer-00.  Although the capacity release market 
was a little tighter last summer it did not significantly drive up capacity 
release prices in the summer-00.  My view is that two of the three power gen 
loads will be interuptible and therfore will not sigificantly increase the 
overall load factor of the system.  The bottom line is that DTI is competing 
with capacity release and I feel there will be enough capacity release 
available on the market this summer to force DTI to sell it's capacity below 
50% of max rate.  However capacity release prices may increase next year as 
more utilities turnback capacity and the new power generation may be in the 
capacity release market.

Market View on Basis on CNG for Summer 01 & Summer 02:
With the increased load and potentially low storage inventory level going 
into this summer, basis could be strong vs historical prices. However, with 
the inception of M&NEP delivering 400,000dt/d into the Northeast last year 
CNG basis (summer strip) was less than $0.20 in Jan-00 and Feb-00,  even 
though the April 1 storage inventory level was the lowest since 1996.  In 
1996 CNG Apr-Oct strip traded as high as high as $0.31 in Feb-96 and dropped 
as low as $0.21 by May-96.  DTI summer load is averages 2.5 - 3.0 Bcf, I 
don't think the 100,000dt/d load of the new power gen load will be 
significant this summer considering the additional supply coming in from 
Dracut.   However with American National Power Inc (34,000Dth/d) and El Paso 
Gas Services Co (139,000dt/d) both coming online in 2001, that have 
contracted for around half of the Dracut supply, this may cause sumer basis 
prices to increase from current levels (Apr-01-Oct-01 strip $0.33) this 
summer and depending on storage inventories 4/1/02,  Apr-Oct-02 basis may be 
also get stronger.

I need to get from you a detailed list of contracts on TCO that have been 
assigned to ENA from either CES or NPC. Specifically I am looking for RPs, 
DPs and the associated primary volumes. The monthly contract list tracks 
demand charges OK, but is not good enough for pathing gas in Winter. Give me 
a call when you get back to discuss.

Below is a parking problem we have with IROQ.  In this example, we were 
notified 1 month after the effective flow date.  Comments?

Angie has documentation from Iroq that she will leave on your desk.  

Angie, for now, please schedule this as parked as current day activity.

Angie/Chris

Just an FYI update on the Iroquois 06/26 parking issue.  This might be 
redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on 07/26/00 that we 
were cut 364 MMBtu's (from 24,502 to 24,138) @ Canajoharie on the evening 
cycle of 06/26/00 (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), & the cut 
volume was placed into PALS.  As I understand it, the late notification was a 
trickle down, i.e. Beth @ CNG notified Iroquois on 07/26, & Iroquois notified 
us when they found out.  Anyway, the 364 MMBtu's are on the August 
Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn, 
incurring parking charges of $173.77 for the month (364 MMBtu's x 31 days = 
11,284 MMBtu's @ $0.0154 = $173.77).  Per Angie's previous e:mail on this 
item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, & this 
parking charge is related, & so, may be disputable.  Either way, the volume's 
currently not in Unify as parked, & will not show up on the Service 
Verification at present.  

Are there any updates to the status on this item?  Thanks.

Brad-

I got your message this morning, and I'm not ignoring you- I have just been 
extremely busy with bid week activities and cleaning for August.  I think I 
know what you're talking about, and I handed that issue over to Chris Germany 
earlier this month.  I have not followed up with it since then, and that is 
my fault.  The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about 
the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely 
notification by any means.  I think that Chris was looking into this issue 
with Colleen Sulllivan, because of the late notification.  I will badger 
Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week 
after the dust has settled from the 1st.  Thanks for understanding.  -Angie

Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the 
2000ces02.xls sheet.  I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and 
highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to 
Sitara.

Meaning... Joann has a number about 250,000/day given to her by the LDC 
Schedulers. This includes daily volume:

Who    Volume  Sitara Deal Ticket
CES Endusers    93689  143336
Choice    107489  148416 
South Jersey   36900  142776

Hopewell   4500  139679
Texaco    255  136502
Engage   1966  142656
Florida Power and Light  152  151788

Total    249,951

Is there a way to put all incremental gas on one deal ticket??? It would make 
our pathing life a lot easier too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

TCO decided to reverse the penalties Enron incurred in January and February. 
The credit is on the TCO's invoice for April.

January = $13,424
February = $13,775

Total Credit = $27,199

TCO Team discussed this penalty situation with TCO's VP, Marsall Lang. TCO 
decided that Enron had not abused the system and did not overrun the TFE 
(Total Firm Entitlement). YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just to clarify who's on first...

Any requests that relate to Appalachian transport capacity tickets will be 
sent to Terry Franklin.  This includes additional capacity tickets that need 
to be set up, changes that need to be made to existing tickets, etc.

Any requests that relate to CES Appalachian purchase deals in Sitara will be 
handled by Wade Price.  Wade will continue setting up new deals, adding 
meters to deals, adjusting prices (based on information provided by John 
Singer), etc.

Once the deal is in the supply list and the appropriate service contract 
shows up in the service list, a request will be sent to Logistics to path the 
deal.  

Please let me know if anyone sees a problem with going forward this way.  
Thanks.

Hello!

As you know, Terry Franklin is beginning to transition into the Appalachian 
coordination role.  We spent time today with Bryce Baxter, Wade Price, and 
Gloria Barkowsky to determine how best to attack the current issues.

As Job 1, we determined that Terry's time is best utilized on transportation 
contract set-up.  Of course, Terry "job description" includes other tasks, 
but at this time, this is her #1 focus.  We decided this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Deals cannot be pathed without transportation contracts set-up in SITARA.
2.  In order to pay the producers and the pipeline, the deals must be pathed 
by Logistics (zero volume paths), and volumes must by allocated (based on 
actuals) by Gloria Barkowsky, Volume Mgmt.
3.  Wade Price, Settlements, is focused on setting up SITARA deals for 
producer wellhead purchases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Thanks,
Carrie

Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify 
after Meredith paths the gas.  Just a note, we will probably be billed 
interest because the payment is late.  I think it was due on 2/26/2000.

retail group in Pittsburgh.  I'm looking into this, but from what I'm hearing 
we are supplying this gas to the retail group and need to make sure that it

My worksheet has a lot of support for the pricing we billed for January.

Take a look at the worksheet and give me a call.  We probably will not be 
able to cover everything at once.  

We still have a few items to bill.  I will let you know what those items are 
and when we expect to bill them.

Subject:  Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209

CGAS storage looks good.  We are still working on the ohters.  I should have 
a better feel by tomorrow afternoon.

Chris,

I just  got off the phone with Rich Contos, he wants me to find out if Enron
concurs with the storage volumes sold.  I think Ernie Simien or Doug Kinney 
had
sent some volumes and associated dollar amounts to you to look at.

Let me know if Enron is in concurrance.

Phone is 713-267-4646 and you can see the e-mail address.

Thanks,

The Donald

CES and CEM will still exist for awhile, maybe forever due to legal issues. I 
wouldn't begin canceling anything as the Choice customers are still in CES's 
name and we don't want any capacity returning or other problems. They should 
begin to be transferred to NPC soon. Why don't you hold off for now. Larry 
Friedeman (419/878-4760) is actually the last CES employee and can be reached 
in his Toledo office through 3/31/01.

I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy 
Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) 
last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM 
should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and 
liability) relationships.

Comments/questions??

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  5/26 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

Subject: Questions


Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for  08/31 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\Aug_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

My sources tell me this means NIMO will continue to assign CES CNG capacity 
unless CES can prove they have primary firm to NIMO.  What I'm not sure of is 
will NIMO start assigning CES the upstream Tetco capacity.

Scott, who at CES worked with NIMO on the capacity elections?

Hi Molly,

I don't know if this will effect Enron or not - I don't even know if Columbia
Energy had any firm capacity off of CNG released through NIMO, but just in
case, I though you might like to know about this.

Sorry I am not much of a help here.

Thanks!

NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:


In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk
will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas
rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.

If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk
last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara
Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity 
to
you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an
Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG
capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March,
2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of 
April.

If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me

Hey team!  I probably won't be here when these are due.  After you finish 
working on the sheet, print one copy for Kim Brown.  

Thanks :)

Keep in mind that we would like "day to day" issues funneled up thru the 
various leads/managers.  This will help consolidate the phone calls and help 
the Unify I.T. folks concentrate on the problem and centralize the points of 
contact for system updates.

The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco.

Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals.  Tetco doesn't know 
how this gas flows.  They are still checking into this one.  It may actually 
flow into CNG.,



Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters.  This gas is a backhaul 
to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a 
forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford.  The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11%.

AGL has posted their September LSR details, so attached is the revised FOM 
numbers.  Also, on TCO 23-5 (COH) there were 7 mmbtu shown as separately 
priced:  per Doug Kinney that deal is not being assigned to New Power, so 
while the required volume isn't changing, the net volume at FOM price goes up 
by 7 mmbtu.  (I took the 7 to 0)

Christina and Scott, I've also attached a preliminary AGL sheet for 9/1 so 
you can begin to assign contract numbers.

David

We only took 80% of what we could, so we can increase by Market Zone delivery,
or not. We have advised any new buyer of the options and are keeping them
informed if we are forced to make a move, as in the case of the 15,000 of
capacity on TCO. We are being conservative and keeping everyone informed.

How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys
looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this
option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my
guess)?

Yes, we can adjust by 10/15. If we add, must pay retro to 4/1 and if
reduce, we
may not get any $ back.

On :  Tennessee  -  We released 403 Dth from Decatur contract 250 and created
contract 32075 for Dynegy / Friskies. Of this 403 Dth Friskies only wants 251
Dth nominated for Jan 1 forward.  This release is good for Jan only and will 
of
course cause the MDQ on contract 250 to go down by 250.

On :  Midcoast - Also for Friskies/Dynegy we released 400 Dth from Midcoast
contract 6005 and created a contract numbered 7010 for Jan specifically for
deliveries to Friskies.  This will cause the MDQ on contract 6005 to decrease
by 400 Dth.


On :  Tennessee  - We released 1,642 Dth from Huntsville contract number 507
and created contract 32076 for Wolverine deliveries to the Midcoast/Tenn
interconnect.  This looks to be a Jan only contract number and must be used so
that Wolverine quantities can be recognized.  This causes contract 507 to go
down by the amount of the release.

On:  Midcoast - We released 1,629 Dth from Huntsville contract 6009 and 
created
contract 7010 for Wolverine deliveries behind the DECATUR city gate.  This 
will
cause the MDQ on contract 6009 to go down by 1,629.

Let me know if you have any questions !

See you this afternoon ,

Hello

Watch your "snail mail" for your invitation to:

Iroquois' 5th Annual Customer Golf Tournament
Monday, August 21
8 am
Tower Ridge Country Club
Simsbury, CT

For a sneak peek (sorry, photos but no course map), visit their website
at http://www.towerridgecc.com/

If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact Robin Almond
at the phone number or e-mail address listed at the end of this message.

We look forward to seeing you on August 21.

-- Your friends at Iroquois.

PS - It has just come to my attention that there is a typo on the reply
page of the invitation - it says "I will/will not be attending Iroquois'
Canadian Golf Tournament".  Although the 5th and 6th holes are pretty
high up on Heublin Ridge, we haven't relocated the tournament to north
of the border, its still in Connecticut. My apologies.

We have a 5,000 day purchase from Bay State that we can take at CNG/Trco 
Leidy or at CNG South pool meter 10002.  The deal number is 418282.  Could we 
put this deal number on the CNG and/or Trco sheet?
We currently have this deal baseloaded to CNG South Pool.  We need to call 
Bay State if we move it.


My contact at Bay State is Stacey Djukic 219-853-4320.  I gave Stacey Angie's 
number as a contact.  If we can't get in touch with Stacey, then talk to

Jeff, I have update this sheet for the actual storage to date.

I'm trying to keep this worksheet simple.  I added the actual numbers per 
navigator.  I think I need to add an Enron balance and a CES balance.  What 
do you guys think?

According to Mr. Goodell, Tetco has Teal Lodge on the seller's block.  I 
think you should buy it.

I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel.  He said we have 
positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS  contract, and we have a balance of 
(797,163) on our ISS.  It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much.

Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we 
need to take out the 301 dt.  Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handling 
this please?

Don't worry about doing it this weekend, take care of it early next week.

Thanks

Here are the January daily volumes for each of the gates.    I know you wanted
an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 
markets
until Thursday as Boston Gas and S. Ct. Algorithms will be available then.   I
have estimates in on those gates.  We will need a range from 2700 dth to 3600
dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of markets due to
weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Net   $3.9875

actually losing $.01 or so before we figure the fuel of 1.95%

Fuel Cost at $4.00 = $4.00/(1-.0195) - $4.00 = $.08

Now its $.09 in the hole (.01+.08)

I'm throwing away anything on my desk with Gatherco.  I'm assuming you and 
Ms. Jordan are taking care of everthing on that.  Also, if you ever need to 
send transport contracts to Houston, its best to send it to Sylvia Campos.  
She is the transport contract Queen and she absolutly loves paper.  So send 
her allllll of your paper.

I ask Heidi Boyd to reduce the May production noms from 800/day to 500/day.
I ask here to nominate 500/day for June.
I was unable to sell any PNG to Amerda Hess (StatOil), therefore we will be 
cashed out by PNG for June.

Currently we are on target for March's total goal of 1,125,300 (36,300 x 31 
days). So far we have 1,132,935 scheduled to be withdrawn. As we get into the 
last week, we will teak the numbers to match as close as we can to the 
1,125,300.

Because TCO is enforcing penalties a lot tougher, I want everyone to be aware 
of the storage withdrawal ratchet levels.

As of 3/14, the maximum storage withdrawal equals 87,582 daily. The current 
storage level remaining is 10.5 %

The next ratchet level is below 10% and will probably hit this on 3/16. The 
maximum storage withdrawal will equal 67,371 daily.

That means the schedulers (Joann, Robert, and myself) need to watch these 
levels when we do Choice and especially on the weekends.

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: VNG Deals

I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara;

Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing.

Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco, 
CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do).

Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF?  I think every time I create a VNG 
deal, a confirm is faxed to them.

AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as 
production area sales), please let me know.  The easiest way I can come up 
with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most 
of the pricing done in a worksheet.

Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 4/28   and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are  4 worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs Apr00':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at
each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled
"NOM".   The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much 
gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be
ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is
archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to
save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Total Reqs May00':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at
each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled
"NOM".   The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much 
gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be
ignored until further notice.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Chris--At this date, CES has a large overhang of storage inventory on AGL.
To address this situation, I have asked David Scott to increase our IBSS
withdrawals to the maximum daily withdrawal quantities for the rest of
February.   Moreover, we also want to maximize our daily withdrawals on the
directly assigned storage services for the rest February.    We don't want gas
injected into storage unless it is necessary to avoid a penalty.   David will
contact Scott about the Directly Assigned storage withdrawals.

To the extent that maximizing our storage withdrawals requires us to cut back
on flowing gas, the cuts in flowing gas will be sold back to ENA  per our
contract.


Please call me if you have questions, etc.

Thanks.

FYI - I believe this is important.  According to Morgan (CES's CNG scheduler) 
CES currently has about 7,000 dth of idle capacity.  I've had 3 people call 
me today looking for CNG capacity for Jan 2000.

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

I just spoke with Jim Scabareti at AGL regarding the releases of capacity.  
AGL/VNG is fine with your proposal to release the assets for three years 
provided the releases are recallable for any reason.  This recall right is 
consistent with our asset management agreement (which basically determines 
the nature of recall rights AGL has under our deal)

So....

Go ahead and release the assets, 100% recallable, for three years.

In reconciling with CES I have come across deal numbers 144284, 229286, and 
232373 that have CES as the counterparty but in the terms they show the deal 
is actually with Allied.  CES has paid everything we invoiced them, including 
these three deals, but they have admitted that they are unfamiliar to them.  
I have not said anything to CES yet.  Do we need to change the counterparty 
or what action should we take?

Thank You,

Molly

Chris, we are not going to be able to repair this problem in the next few
days.  We need to do some programming work.  If you guys would go ahead and
pay the bill, it'll be washed out in an adjustment hopefully next month.
The bill itself is correct, it's just on the wrong contract.
Let me know if this is ok with you.   Thanks, ii

Jeff, here are my questions and comments:
Section II. A.  Do you think the 2.6 sentence is clear enough--meaning, they 
couldn't take this to mean they have a 10% daily tolerance on their 
nomination, just a 10% monthly nomination.

Section II.B.  4.1--As discussed, we need to add the words "LDC or interstate 
pipeline" after the word applicable in the third to the last line.

Storage section:
Need to add a 5% tolerance to their monthly storage nomination.
Then, we need to add a mechanism to handle their being off from that first of 
the month storage nomination.
The concept should be this:
If they are within 5% of their monthly storage nomination (in the paper pool 
or bank in Ed McMichael's proposal) but not at exactly 100% of the 
nomination, this volume variance will be rolled to another month and the 
proxy schedule amended.  The parties must  mutually agree to the month the 
hedges will roll to (protecting us if we have already rolled some hedges for 
our own benefit), with the financial impact of these hedge changes being 
borne by CES.
If they are outside the 5% monthly nomination, the volume outside the 5% will 
be handled as follows:
If storage takes are less than 95% of the Monthly storage nomination, the 
volume that falls in this category will be sold to ENA at the lower of (i) 
the average of the five lowest current month prices as published in Gas Daily 
for the applicable location; or (ii) the following month's Inside FERC or NGI 
monthly index, as applicable, minus $.01.  If storage takes are greater than 
105% of the Monthly storage nomination, that volume will be purchased by CES 
at the greater of (i) the average of the five highest current month prices as 
published in Gas Daily for the applicable location; or (ii) the following 
month's Inside FERC or NGI monthly index, as applicable, plus $.01, plus any 
applicable transportation and storage injection or withdrawal costs.  

I have not proposed this exact process to Melissa yet, but I have left her a 
message that I want to discuss this.   I'll let you know how that goes, but I 
think this is a reasonable concept.  The only question is....will she think 
so?

  Per Jeff Hodge.

Here is an initial draft of an Agreement to finalize the retail issues.  
Please note that I have not included anything on gas buy back yet.  I would 
like to get some confirmation on that issue before drafting.

Otherwise, your thoughts and comments will be appreciated.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.

Can you believe it... I was wrong.

Hans Rotman (Fuel Manager at CES, left in 12/99), did a deal with Aristech 
last Sept/Oct for Aristech to release the excess capacity to CES in April and 
May. John Whited (Fuel Manager at CES, still there) thinks it was release in 
CES's name. Like Chris said, we really don't need the capacity. We are short 
Hopewell capacity in Market Area 33 on the East Side. This capcity is on the 
West Side in Kentucky.

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: Aristech Capacity

Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May.  
This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this 
capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.  

I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take the 
space if we don't have to.

Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management 
group.

Just found out that we have acces to 15,000 of Aritech's capacity on TCO for
Apr & May, for $0.01, primary COH 3-15. Can we replace capacity ENA bought for
4/1 and would there be any cost?

Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.  Following are 
the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000


Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment
47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes 
below 4,723 per day. 
          Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.

21881  4,599  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below

21882  518  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below


Comments:
If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand 
charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  

Questions for Tennessee;
What are the rates for October?
Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or 
monthly quantities?

Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have 
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need 
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;

   "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they 
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks

The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM

get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and 
transmission contracts moved over.

Subject: Opt 60 for 2/4

the OPT 60 contract has been restricted again for 2/4.  I spoke with TCO and 
they explained that the notice was posted late (11:15am) due some internal 
issue at TCO.  I normally check the notices early am and then again once 
nominations has be scheduled. 
wges  was=7314 now=0
hopewell was=25500 now=0
cgv1  was=209 now=0

I will need Emporia/Transco to deliver to Hopewell and any markets in oper 1.


thanks
joann

Colleen need your help with this one. Choice is having huge temperature 
swings causing drastic demand changes. Also, the new Choice SST contract mdq 
was reduced from 134,000 to 54,000 in April. There are several cold days that 
are causing ENA to service Choice via IT ($0.05/dkt) and Contract Overruns 
($0.21/dkt).
Do these charges get passed back to CES?

The TCO schedulers are trying to be proactive, by looking at Intraday Temps. 
Unfortunately, we are having a hard time estimating the actual burn. The CDC 
posts a forecast, one day before gas flow. CDC does not post intraday temps, 
we look at the National Weather Service. CDC only posts actuals, once the gas 
day is ended. Once the gas day is ended, TCO and CDC only allow adjustments 
on the SST contract as a no-notice storage withdrawal adjustment. Because the 
burns are increasing during the cold periods, we are overrunning the 
contracts.

Just want to ensure everyone is on the same page before ENA receives TCO's 
April bill, and CES receives ENA's April bill. I have not discussed this with 
CES yet, wanted to ensure ENA is on the same page.

So far this month:

4/4 IT = 25,589 Overrun = 6000
4/8 IT = 22,226 Overrun = 8000
4/9 IT = 12,404 Overrun = waiting on actuals
4/10 IT = 8,200 Overrun = waiting on actuals

Accumulated Estimated Cost

IT = $3421 Overrun = $2940

There was another suggestion to use the Idle transport for Hopewell and Calp. 
At this time, I strongly advise not using the swing transport. If Hopewell 
and Calp come up... it is usually late intraday... and does not give us 
enough time to switch the transport with the CDC's. The penalty for Choice 
gas not showing up is $25/dkt and getting kicked out of the Choice program. 
The CDC's do not accept retro's for Choice gas. Believe me... I have tried 
several times!!!! Usually CES has enough behind the citygate pool gas to help 
balance for minor differences (under 100 dkt). Also, TCO is not as friendly 
as they used to be in doing retro's for Choice gas.

Thank you for your help.

Subject: CES Supply Management Agreement

New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market 
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our 
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below 
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on 
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will 
only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" as 
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct 
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load 
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the 
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being 
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.

2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for 
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would 
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In 
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also 
include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 
64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for 
CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and 
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the 
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase 
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All 
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I 
agreements.

3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity 
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I 
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your 
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity 
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our 
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to 
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for 
un-utilized capacity. 

4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.  
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar 
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power 
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only 
transactions would not be subject to this clause.    

I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss 
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next 
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your 
help.

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.

Okay.... to ensure we are all on the same page. We will try to hit your

Because choice burns are so low... I'll nominate about 33,000/day of the
choice burn directly from storage. Joann Collins will use about 15,000/day
to other CES Enduser Market. Just remember, we are at the mercy of mother
nature. When the actuals arrive.... we balance off storage. So if it gets
colder than the forecast, the storage withdrawal will increase. If it gets
warmer, the storage withdrawal will decrease.

If for some reason you want to change this 48,000/day target... just let me
know by 10 EST. This will allow enough time to switch the nom's.

Dick Jenkins and Chris Germany will review if they want "CES to sell back
flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the storage withdrawal at this
level." (quoted from your other e-mail).

Do you know your March target number for storage withdrawal??? I can
provide your storage balance if needed. Remember, that operationally.... I
use the storage to keep your choice burn balanced with choice actuals.

Thank you!!!!

Subject:  COH Storage Withdrawals


Joan--I got your voicemail regarding the current daily requirement for COH
Choice.   I understand that you won't be able to pull the 48,000 dth/day
from
storage if the load requirement is below that level.   I anticipate that we
may
be in that situation for at least the next few days, and I will check with
Kara
regarding the burn levels in the future.   We'll figure out day by day how
much
we want to pull and we'll get that to you prior to your 10am EST nom
deadline.     Don't redo your nom for 2/24; just leave it as is.

Thanks.

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will
need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better
winter riding gear.

We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.  All we are doing
is verifying Dad's signature on the will.  Once the judge sees us it should
only take about five minutes.

That's all I have for now.

I checked the CGLF and CGAS capacity against Navigator.  Take a look and let 
me know what you think.  Also, do you know the demand charges for the CGAS 
items highlighted in purple?

Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio?  I would like to see it if we do.  I 
don't show any record of a deal like this.  I'm going to send an email to my 
CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this.

Sandra, I just have to get with Chris Germany to see if he can confirm this 
deal. I will keep you posted. Thanks, Rob

Chris, Deal # 153683, Please take a look at this and see if you can confirm 
that this was Buy/Sell or incremental. CES or EES? I have a supply but no 
market. Thanks

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase.

Stephanie,
Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system.

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

Subject: Egan Storage

The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen 
contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party 
gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.  

I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of 
you is it?

I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this.

Were we given a different demand charge from CES than what the contract 
actually is, or was this our error?  Is this contract passed through and 
payable by Devon or are we at risk?  Please advise.

I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.

CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West 
Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts 
and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric 
demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648

I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the 
worksheet.

Mr. Germany,

How are things going?  You still pursuing JD's girl?  How's Corey doing?
Did you ever move into the bigger one-bedrooms at Bayou Park?  I hope so --
those studio apartments are too small.  How's Ingrid? doing?

As for myself, I have never been so busy in my life -- papers, group
projects, tests, etc.  I rarely have time to go out, and that really sucks
because the undergraduate women around here are just spectacular.  Granted,
they tend to be a bit bitchy (being rich daddy's girls and all), but they're
very easy on the eyes.  Anyway, if the trend continues, I doubt if I'll be
getting laid much during my two years at Vandy -- too many damn papers to
write!

Let me know how things are going.  I just got an e-mail from Jim; I think
I'll just be starting module 2 around Nov. 4, so I'll see if I can make it
down there.

In the meantime, my address here in Nashville is:

401 Village at Vanderbilt
Nashville, TN  37212
615/ 321-9648

Keep in touch,

Chad

Hey.  What is your professional opinion about this?  This was sent to me by 
my scheduler.  I assume this just means that if you don't have primary NIMO 
capacity on CNG, NIMO will continue to assign CNG capacity to you each 
month.  True?

In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk

Re:  Texas Gas Rate Changes Effective 1/1/01

On November 30, 2000 Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP01-
135-000 pursuant to the Settlement Agreement in Docket No.
RP97-344, in which the Commission required Texas Gas to
reduce certain Account No. 858 contracts.  In the instant
filing Texas Gas proposes to reflect rate reductions
resulting from the termination of the HIOS T-17 contract.
Included in the filing were revised rates under Texas Gas'
Rate Schedule FT which Transco utilizes to render service to
its customers under its Rate Schedule FT-NT.  The revised
tariff sheets have a proposed effective date of January 1,
2001.  If accepted as proposed, the revised Texas Gas tariff
sheets would result in the following changes in Transco's
current Rate Schedule FT-NT Rates:


Zone SL Demand Charge -  $0.0192 decrease
Zone 1 Demand Charge  -  $0.0192 decrease


Please refer any questions to Mike Heeney, Rate Department,
at (713) 215-2424.

Scott -
We received from Melissa Flewellyn a storage proxy schedule on March 15, as 
required per the contract.  Is Jeff's e-mail indicating that there is a 
change to this document?  I will forward to you separately the memo from 
Melissa showing this schedule.

Jeff Porter at CES said in a 3/16 email...

 as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
 submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
 the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
 made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
 Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17.  Is it a problem that it 
wasn't March 15?

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on 
Feb 23rd?  I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.  MDQ = 5000 and the 
rate is $.01?  Who did this deal?

The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery 
point is Rayne.  It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.  I'm 
setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I 
entered it in Sitara deal 223022.

Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify.

ENA nominated Reliant Energy Field Services contract 96034155 on the third 
party pipe for January business.  This contract is set up with an effective 
date of 02/01/2000 rather than 01/01/2000 in the Global Contracts system.  Is 
it possible to change the date in the Global Contracts system, or should we 
not have used this contract for January business?

Thanks for your help.

I have invoice information for CNG Field Services for january 2000 that John 
Singer sent to me.  Their are two deals out there that have the IF + 0.12 
pricing according to John's notes. 

Deal  204785 has location 25-35 CPA Pittsburg and has volumes actualized ( I 
am having trouble drafting a statement though) .  This deal was entered by 
Chris Germany on 2/24.  The volumes currently allocated to this deal are  
23,963  versus the 13,113 on the invoice.

Deal 216175 has location 25E CPA-4  with the same pricing, but no volumes. 
Wade Price entered this deal on 3/10 (not knowing of the other deal until a 
couple of days ago).  This deal should be killed.

I will pay the invoice as soon as we can correct the deal, the confirm the 
volumes, and get a supply verification out.

Thanks for everyone's assistance and interest in taking care of these.  WRP

A few more questions --
What about for the Central Desk volumes?  Who is going to estimate those ??  
Who is going to compare March noms with the booked volume on Exhibit ?
Who is going to physically be the one to enter the deals in Sitara / TAGG, 
both for Central and East for the remaining term April 2000 through March 
2001???
When will it go into the books ??

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES.  

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
advise.

Just a note to let you know Columbia Gas has some capacity postings on the 
EBB for next winter.  BIDS ARE DUE 3/15 AT 9AM.
Attached is a spreadsheet showing the parcel numbers.  I highlighted the 
meters that you did not have enough capacity to serve your load this winter.
I would be happy to bid on this as your agent, but let me know what rate 
works based on your economics.  This is a bid process, so the current low bid 
is just an indication of the market value of the capacity.  

Scott

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

There is a later one also than came back undeliverable and I resent which I
will forward.   And also per Brian we needed it through the end of month
also.

It does get confusing.   There are numbers flying around from everywhere.   I
guess there is nothing you can do today.   I really need this through the end
of month.   There are huge penalties involved here.

Subject: Cut Gas 1/26

I just found out through COH reports that 500 dth delivered to mkt 5-7 via
K38094 (First Energy) did not show up on the 26th of January.

As a result of this and other factors, a total delivery volume to that agg 
pool
went from the 484 dth requested amount to 217 dth.  This was during the OFO
period.  Not sure how we are going to handle the resulting penalties, but just
wanted to make sure that Enron does not pay First Energy for those volumes.
Sorry I was not notified of this cut sooner.

Please let me know if ?s

Good news, even better when it happens.  My contract at CES, Brian Perrone, 
just told me CES will pay the invoice we billed them.  They still need to 
reconstruct January.

Billing
I still need to work on January capacity and sales to CES.
I found a significant amount of transport I left out of January.  I want to 
fix the Feb capacity sheet and bill CES tomorrow or Fri for capacity and the 
scheduling fee.
The Feb invoicing should be much cleaner and ready to go out by the 10th.

I entered this deal in the system with the wrong term date.  I entered this 
as a Dec-00 deal.  The term is 11/23 - 11/30/2000.

My fault.  I corrected Sitara.

Mr. Germany,

How are things going?  You still pursuing JD's girl?  How's Corey doing?
Did you ever move into the bigger one-bedrooms at Bayou Park?  I hope so --
those studio apartments are too small.  How's Ingrid? doing?

As for myself, I have never been so busy in my life -- papers, group
projects, tests, etc.  I rarely have time to go out, and that really sucks
because the undergraduate women around here are just spectacular.  Granted,
they tend to be a bit bitchy (being rich daddy's girls and all), but they're
very easy on the eyes.  Anyway, if the trend continues, I doubt if I'll be
getting laid much during my two years at Vandy -- too many damn papers to
write!

Let me know how things are going.  I just got an e-mail from Jim; I think
I'll just be starting module 2 around Nov. 4, so I'll see if I can make it
down there.

In the meantime, my address here in Nashville is:

401 Village at Vanderbilt
Nashville, TN  37212
615/ 321-9648

Keep in touch,

Chad

Chris,

I'm looking for gas delivered to two Tetco M2 interconnects with TCo.

At the minimum, I'm looking for an offer for a flat baseload volume for 
December flow.  My preference is to get an offer for a flat baseload volume 
from December through March.  The points and volumes are:
 Delmont {Volume:  3,712/day}
 Windrifge {Volume:  2,859/day}

Can I get a nymex plus offer?

Thanks.

mhg

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES.  

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
advise.

Subject: CES Daily March Requirements for 4/3 and 4/4


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   4/3
(Intraday)     and 4/4  .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with
today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes in this spreadsheet are not
current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Subject: Storage true up

I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage true 
up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via 
interoffice to Jeff.

There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably 
be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.

How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his 
understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.

Here is the phone number for the kennel 281-449-3027.  Here's how you get 
there.  Take JFK (South - away from the airport) accross Beltway 8 to 
Aldine-Bender (next major intersection after the beltway).  Take a right on 
Aldine-Bender and go to the 2nd street which is Milner.  There are no lights 
at Milner and Aldine - you just have to watch for the road.  Go 1 block to 
Renton.  Take a left on Renton and its the 2nd or 3rd house down.

Subject: Re: Terminating Transco contracts  

My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and 
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries.  They are
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.  The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among 
other things.

Subject: Terminating Transco contracts

As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.  I don't think we should make any changes to 
the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.  However, we will 
need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in 
Sitara.  Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.

I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this 
ticket), 268090, and 268093.

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this 
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the 
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sitara #418415 is a transport capacity deal for a demand charge on Transco.  
It is pointed to the IM VNG desk which we have not started using yet.  Can 
you change that to IM-East?

of $236,000, but I don't see deal 425332 with a big positive number

 Under section four it shows where we cashed Account 6&7 to pay Mary.  It 
shows
entire balance but we only paid out $40,000.


Next question, we moved the money out of Dad's IRA's prior to death,  so we do
not have to show this right.

So you are using the current month's capacity times the cumulative theoretical
% to determine the total storage volume to date. In that case, have you
credited CES each month for an overcharge of gas for each previous month? If
you are doing that and plan to for the next 8 months, let me know and I will
adjust my numbers, but that has got to be an accounting nightmare.
I propose each month's volume is THAT months storage capacity times the
percentage. There is no retro adjustment needed plus it is easier to stay
within ratchets. See attached spreadsheet for difference in numbers for EES. (
I am out of town and cannot get into my files, so the capacity numbers are a
bit off, but it explains the concept).
Simply, can you agree on my numbers from below for the sale to NPC? If you 
have
been adjusting each month and want to keep it that way, OK. You will just have
to get the billing straight with Doug. Let me know.

Subject:  Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209

Subject: CES Storage

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

Subject: Equitrans

I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?  
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts 
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).  
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe 
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my 
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing 
shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks

Are you still willing to provide assistance for establishing New Power to do 
business on the interstate pipelines?  I would welcome the help if the offer 
is still there.  Talk with the appropriate individuals internally and give me 
a call at your convenience. Since ENA is doing all of the nominating upstream 
at the moment, there is not a tremendous sense of urgency.  However, I would 
like to move ahead on this quickly anyway.  

I would see TCO, Transco, Sonat and TETCO as first tier requirement.  CNG, 
NGPL, ANR and Panhandle are probably on the second tier.  

Thanks Chris.

Chris, Faye has completed moving all of the facilities on your request, 
EXCEPT meter 006335 because a deal that is booked on that meter had volumes 
with a status other than "expected" which means we have to work on that 
behind the scenes.  Below is a list of deals that were impacted by her moving 
all of the other meters.  I am bouncing the server and it wil take about 15 
minutes to complete.  After that, you will have to get completely out of all 
open Sitara applications (including the Launch Pad) and get back in.  Open 
the deals listed below and make sure the location field on the deal exchange 
says "inconsistent".  You should only be concerned with the exchanges for 
6/1/00 and forward.  Click Edit and then go to the location field and click 
on the ellipsis.  Click OK when the Facility dialogue box opens and the 
correct zone should appear automatically.  Before you tab out of that field, 
make sure that the deal volume equals the expected volume.  If the volumes 
are not equal, make a note of the expected volumes and how they are broken 
out because they will default to the deal volume as soon as you tab out.  If 
the volumes are different, update them as necessary and then release the 
deal.  Repeat this for all exchanges for 6/1/00 and forward and for all 
deals.  The second thing you need to do is identify any swaps that are linked 
to the physical forwards.  If none are linked then that's great because you 
won't have to worry about that.  If some exist, you will have to update the 
swap to reflect the correct zone.  To do this, you need to edit the swap, go 
to the field location, remove the current (inconsistent) one and add the 
correct zone.  Hopefully this makes sense.  Please call me if you have any 
questions.  I will follow up with you on the meter 006335 tomorrow.

Crystal,

I know that you have already set up the TAGG deals, I just wanted to be sure 
that you had all of the information.

We are able to park up to 300,000 over the month of October.  The gas is to 
be returned to us in January 2001.  The fee is .04 per MMBtu, but it will be 
negotiable on a daily basis.  This will be billed prorata from October to 
January.  The volumes can also flluctuate daily.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

It's not a short pay that I am concerned with.  They are a netout customer.  
They only billed us for  $2,717,153.94. We show that we owe them 
$5,479,867.12.  I thought that you were checking on a buy/sale that was 
supposed to cancel off some of this payable amount.  They paid us 
$17,705,483.84, which is the net of what they owed us and what they think we 
owed them.

Call if that doesn't make sense.

Okay... CES should be up-to-date on all Navigator data runs for CES, ENA, 
CALP as shippers for Jan, Feb, Mar, and April. I sent each month seperately 
to Molly and Ernie as comma delimited files. Ernie was successful with the 
first file I sent.

Just remember that these files include the complete data dump for all 
transport. I sent Molly and Ernie the package id's that should be excluded 
(Enron Markets). 

Also, the volumes may change or have changed due to TCO actuals.

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I entered deal 477669 in Sitara as a purchase from New Power at the FOM index 
pricing.

Jeff, I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate 
sale to you, also at the FOM price.

Jeff, I'm out all next week, just call Joann and she will get the pricing and 
enter the deals.

Also, just so I don't forget, I sold 5000 dth day of TCO Pool to New Power 
for the 10th-30th at $5.68.  I won't enter a deal for this, I just need to 
incorporate it into my citygate pricing.

demand is 2dth. I have a call in to CPA, go ahead and nom 2 on K#66940. Chris

Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now.  
We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary 
(be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.

She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide 
the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's 
lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal thinks 
we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.

I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.  Do you care?

I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major 
frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.  Hope for the best!!

Later

the demand and are the rates that Transco had been marketing for the 
project.  Each shipper is responsible for fuel and the electric power 
commodity charge and ACA.  There will be no GRI or Great Plains commodity 
surcharges.  The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points are Transco Zone 6 NY 
points.  The Camden, Trenton-Woodbury and Princeton Junction points are 
non-NY.
 Williams reduced their precedent agreement volume from 210,000 Dthd to the 
100,000 Dthd.  Williams' rights to PSEG points are north of the Linden 
allocation point.  Virginia Power is buying a project from Statoil on the 
Trenton-Woodbury line.  Virginia Power's commitment to MarketLink replaces 
one of Statoil's two precedent agreements.  Statoil has also sold another 
project that was underlying their second precedent agreement.  The new and 
unnamed project owner has requested and been granted an extension to the 
90,000 Dthd precedent agreement for a later phase of MarketLink.  Sunset 
Energy Fleet has requested and been granted an extension for their 95,600 
Dthd precedent agreeement.  LFG, a landfill gas developer, has also been 
granted an extension of their 5,000 Dthd precedent agreement to enable LFG to 
finalize a sale with a new owner or to locate an alternative landfill site.  
PPL Energy Plus has the right to deliver into a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL Interstate Energy Company pipeline system in Lower Mt. Bethel 
Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania or a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL's Eden plant in East Drumore Township, Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania on a primary basis.  They also have the right to extend their 
agreement at the $0.18 rate for an additional two five year terms.  Dynegy 
(30,000 Dthd) and Engage (210,000 Dthd) terminated their respective precedent 
agreements.  Due to these terminations and reductions,  Transco only has 
announced precedent agreements of 190,600 Dthd for later phases.  If these 
precedent agreements become contracts, MarketLink would have 486,600 Dthd of 
shipper volume.  Transco has stated that all 700,000 Dthd of MarketLink would 
be built by 11/01/04.

FYI!  Commonwealth Energy is going to add two new meter sets to their 
existing CNG contract.  These meters will be at Bridgeport and are expected 
to do about 15 dths a day.  The well names are James R. Kelly #1 and Russell 
Marsh #1.  They are both located in Barbour County, WV.  The meter numbers 
are not known at this time and they will be added with our 10/00 production 
period.

Thanks,
Heidi

our monthly flowing volume requirements for the NIPSCO Choice program,
including estimated peak-day requirements (part of which come out of

Can you please give us a price quote for getting these volumes to the NIPSCO
citygate?

Please call me if you have questions.

CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  CES is selling 2500 
dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4.  Looks like a match to me.  I told Fred 
with Equitable the information John Singer gave to Phil below.  For future 
reference Fred's number is 412-395-3295.  A backup contact at Equitable is 
Steve Rafferty, 412-395-3268.

Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective 
12/1/99.  On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal 
141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake.  I don't see a sale anywhere to 
FirstEnergy.  

Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.  
I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.

Comments?

Chris,

This has to do with that TENN zone 4 deal that you e-mailed me about this
morning. Like I mentioned earlier, we never scheduled this gas, it was handled
on a back to back basis.

Phil,
FirstEnergy called to change the contract number for the sale I made to them
(originally to Belden & Blake) to be delivered to the Carroll Co Meter.  The
new contract number is 32082.
If you receive this email before you page me, that's what the page is about.
Call or email me with any questions.
Thanks,
John

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is what I show for the 1st 5 days.  We are off about 552 dth on the 2nd 
and the 3rd, all the other numbers seem close enough.  I had an error in my

try my sheet again, it is adjusted to pool and the 1st is still good. Since 
COH is the only TCO market with any swing, I am sticking with those to 
calculate. We look 5,000 off on 2 & 3. 
I have 41,858(FOM)+15,000 (NP Buy)-53,798(TCO usage)=(3,060) sell to NPC.
These were TCO totals but my COH numbers on 2 & 3 match, adjusted for F% to 
pool.

Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the

highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to 
Sitara.

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

I spoke with Charles Taylor about this breakfast and he is checking with his 
assistant to 
get a head count.  The day he mentioned is Wednesday, Dec. 13th if that works 
for us.  He
will get back to me tomorrow.  Obviously, all of the schedulers won't be able 
to attend, but we
should be back in the office by 9:00, so two of you could possibly go if one 
could be here to check 
reports for that day before trading gets crazy.  

Judy, Chris, Scott -
Let me know who you want included from the customer service group.  I already 
told them to include Ingrid.

I will keep you posted.

  We had a breakfast at TETCO this morning and it was a huge success.  

   Could you all work with Transco/Tennesee and let me know what would be a 
good morning for them?

   I will need the following...

   Date: 
   Address & Room #:
   Contact Name @ Transco/Tennessee and Phone #:  
   Setup time: (7:30am?)
   Eat time:  (8:00am?)
   Headcount:  - please include those attending from Enron. 

   Your assistance with this would be greatly appreciated, 

   Many thanks!

I'm almost positive I approved of this deal and I didn't tell you.  Do you 
have any comments to add?  I'm going to forward this to Scott and Dick and 
ask them how they would like for me to handle this.   Do not share any of

Subject: CKY 6-12 January 2000 - cut 29th 767 dth

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from 
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.   However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.   They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.     When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.   I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.   I 
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.   I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.   I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.    She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.   She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).   I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.   However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.   I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short,  we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).   Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.   
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

The contracts are the transportation agreements on CNR.  Robert sat with

I'll be in meetings until 3:30, so please feel free to talk to Robert Allwein

minutes talking about this to get on the same page before anyone gets too far

She's identified all the remaining rate changes needed for today's payments, 
the transport contracts needed to be setup, Sitara numbers needed for 
contracts already set up, and the meters needing to be linked to transport 
contracts.  I'm still fuzzy on this whole process and am not sure what Robert

I'll be up shortly, working with Brenda... let's see if a meeting would be

Chris,

I just  got off the phone with Rich Contos, he wants me to find out if Enron
concurs with the storage volumes sold.  I think Ernie Simien or Doug Kinney 
had
sent some volumes and associated dollar amounts to you to look at.

Let me know if Enron is in concurrance.

Phone is 713-267-4646 and you can see the e-mail address.

Thanks,

The Donald

I wrote this poem for you because of all the work you guys do.


  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
  and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
  Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 

  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
  From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say. 

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
  "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth. 

  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
  Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 

  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
  More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

Chris,

How the hell are you?

Hope all is well.

I was wondering if you could forward to me a list of all of the pipeline 
capacity and storage assets that you have on behalf of CES.  I am in the 
process of setting up New Power on the respective pipes.

Credit is an issue.  To better know how much credit NPC needs, I thought it 
would be good to see how much FT CES gets on each pipe.
  
Do you maintain a spreadsheet similar to the one you used to maintain for 
EES' assets?

Can you tell what I have?  Make sense?

Thanks.
Mike

I changed the formula on the IF-CNRGATH curve in the EastMrkt file.  Before 
the change it was CGT/APPALAC - $.32.  After the change its (CGAS - 
$.30)x(1-.0492).  This widens the spread by about $.24.

Hi Lori,

I believe we are still pulling our Local Production from you behind NYSEG,
please let me know ASAP if you disagree.

I am going to pull    1620 dth's/day  , again, let me know if this creates a
problem for you.

Thanks!

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  5/30 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Jeff Porter with New Power just informed me that they are buying "a little 
more" than 4,300 dth per day of citygate gas on CGAS.  Dick and I will be 
chatting about this later today.

Joann found out about this yesterday and this is the first time I've heard 
about it.

Clarissa, what did you find out about me receiving different volumes at Boston
than what I requested.  We are penalized for over or under deliveries to that
pool.  We are now in "critical day" status, which means that we are charged 5
times the daily index, which is GDA plus some other charges. It is very
important that I receive exactly the volume requested.  Please talk with the
shipper and ask that they adjust the volume each day as requested.

I know that these are small voumes, but we have to play by the rules.

Day 1, requested 75, received 82
Day 2, requested 97, received 100
day 3, requested 87


For the weekend, I have changes only going to the Boston meter.

Did you guys execute the PSNC contract?? And if so - as CES or CEM??  Also, 
I'd like to have the offer number.

I think Transco is done except for PSNC.

Transco Stuff
I set up several Atlanta contracts and 2 storages - all CES
I set up 3 small Boston Gas contracts - all CES.
I set up the S Jersey capacity - CEM.

I think thats it.

Joan,

The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was 
never
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed 
February's
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have January 
and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?

Thanks!

Paulette

Roman and Paulette,

Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday
March 24th. As soon as Mark Feldman (Enron payment God) receives February's
bill, he can pay this one too.

Thank you for your patience during this transition.

The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen 
contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party 
gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.  

I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of 
you is it?

I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this.

Subject: Storage true up

I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage
true up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via
interoffice to Jeff.

There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should
probably be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the
Central desk.

How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his
understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.

Before I respond to Chris on this, it brings up a question.  I know we 
included the cost of the parking service in the true up, but what about the 
value of the gas?  If gas was parked, then we received free gas---did we 
account for this somewhere in the deal  (i.e., it should be a positive to 
ENA)?  If so, then the question on the sale of this gas is simple--was it a 
one day swing sale to CES-Retail or was it part of the base load package, 
then bill that price accordingly.  If we got the gas for free, then that's a 
different story.

Please let me know what was booked for this deal.   Thanks.

We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.  The volume is 34,248 
dts and the price is $2.22.  
I did not Bill CES for this deal.  According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the 
gas and we paid it back in January.  Tom said CES was going to pay us for 
this.  Should I bill the Retail group for this?  It looks more like a 
wholesale transaction.

Pop's just called me.  He's done with his testing and he's going nuts staying 
in the Hotel.  He is going home now, and will drive back tomorrow for the

Congratulations on your purchase of CES Retail.  Chris and I usually handle 
the capacity so we wanted to touch base with you before August business 
begins.
Are you keeping the CES entity for the month of August or switching to TNPC?  
If you don't switch for August, when do you expect the name change to occur?

If you stay under the CES name, business should proceed as usual.  If you 
switch, keep in mind:

For the Columbia Choice programs, the utility is required to release to the 
party responsible for billing Choice customers.  For July- Columbia Maryland, 
Columbia Virginia, and Columbia Ohio released space to CES then I would 
re-release the capacity to ENA for nomination purposes.  This would refund 
the original shipper the demand charges, then ENA would receive the transport 
charges and bill CES direct.  Do you have an entity for Columbia Gulf and 
Columbia Gas for this?  If you do, please submit paperwork for ENA to have 
agency rights.  If not, call Erin Scott at 713-267-4212 to set up your 
business party.

For Atlanta Gas Light, said they will continue to release to ENA, unless told 
otherwise.  Releases begin 7/19 for August allocations.

I will be out of the office 7/13, returning 7/21, so call Chris with any 
questions.
Scott

Don't forget to chat with VNG about Nabisco.  

VNG should have released 700 dth of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 
11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001.  Nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at 
the time.  During Nov bidweek for Dec, Nabisco asked me to release the 
capacity.  Since the term was less than 1 year, I couldn't release the 
capacity non-biddable.  I spoke to Jeff Huston about it early last week and 
he said he would get back to me.   Dick suggested I tell you.  TAGG - you're 
it, I will await your command.  Mr. Scott Goodell said we could release the 
capacity for 1 year eff 1/1/2001 and then recall Nov and Dec.

We have a 2500 dt/day supply from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  This deal is matched 
with a term sale to FirstEnergy (deal 145648 for Jan and deal 157848 for Feb

the sale to FirstEnergy.

Subject:  Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209

I have a couple of questions about the GELP contract.  First, in the 
agreement's Attachment A, there are several fuel contracts agreements listed 
that GELP has (or had) in place with various counterparties.  I'm wondering 
what the status of these agreements is--have they expired, are they still in 
place, etc.  These agreements are:
Purchase Agreements:
 Union Pacific Fuels--I understand that this is the Duke contract that 
currently supplies GELP--Can we get a copy of this agreement?
 Tejas Power Corporation--Expired ???
 Columbia Energy Services Corporation dated 1/15/96 - Expired ???
Storage Agreements
 Columbia Gas Transmission SIT #41825 - Status ??
Transportation Agreements
 CGT-IT agreement #41828 - I'm assuming this is the agreement used to get gas 
to GELP--is Duke or CES agent on this?
 Commonwealth Gas Services - same question as CGT IT agreement
  Note:  According to the billing calculations, it appears that the Duke 
supply arrangement must have some 
   FT transport--whose name is that in?
Other Contracts
 Transco - to be acquired - Is there an IT agreement on Transco that is 
used?  If so, we need contract # and is someone agent on the transport?

Also, in the GELP agreement you indicated that you get real time meter 
information from a Bristol RTU.  How will ENA get this meter information?

Also, just in general--could you explain your perspective on the value 
proposition in this agreement?  I understand that there is a $5000 fee you 
receive each month that accompanies alot of reporting responsibilities.  
Since the data you provided for last year showed very little gas deliveries 
in the "winter period" (where you would receive $.05/MMBtu additional 
compensation), there doesn't seem to be much up side value there.   Are there 
other values you see to this deal that we may be missing?  

Thanks for your assistance.

Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 
1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection 
volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did 
for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for 
the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 
1,210,121.

I will try to monitor the deal volume.

Thanks.

New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market 
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our 
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below 
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on 
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will 
only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" as 
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct 
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load 
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the 
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being 
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.

2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for 
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would 
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In 
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also 
include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 
64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for 
CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and 
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the 
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase 
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All 
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I 
agreements.

3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity 
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I 
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your 
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity 
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our 
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to 
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for 
un-utilized capacity. 

4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.  
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar 
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power 
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only 
transactions would not be subject to this clause.    

I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss 
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next 
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your 
help.

Good morning.   I did locate the pooling agreement request form.   We had
originally talked about mailing these to you but faxing would be quicker.  I
am faxing that to you this morning.   It needs to be completed and faxed
back to us as soon as you can.   Also,  I am faxing a Pool Meter List form
and a Pool Operator Confirmation form (these are also available on our
website (www.equitrans.com) under the Equipath menu option.)

The Pool Meter List form needs to list all meters that you are placing in
your pool.   The Pool Operator Confirmation form will need to list all of
the shippers and their contracts that will be nominating out of your pool.


The Pool Meter List and the Pool Operator Confirmation form will need to be
completed monthly.  Normally these are due to Equitrans 30 days prior to gas
flow.  We will make an exception for August as this will be your first
month.  Try to have the latter two forms to us by mid July.

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas 
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I 
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR 
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone 
know the deal tickets by the end of the day.

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi Karen,

Please nominate a volume of 24,800 dth's for the month of July 00 for CES'
local production.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our
local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the local
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will need
to mention in the letter?

Thanks,

I need a new pipeline set up.  CES currently has 1.5 BCF of LNG storage on 
this pipeline under 3 separate contracts.  All 3 contracts expire 2/29/00.

Name:   Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership
Internet Address: http://www.latec.com/covepointlng/
Curve:   Tetco M3


This deal is currently entered in Sitara under deal 142034 as CPR Storage on 
CGAS.  We have withdrawals of 75,000 day from the 12th through the 31st.


Linda, would you see if you have a copy of the contracts from CES?

Please let me know what I need to do.

FYI.  Commonwealth Energy is adding a new meter to their existing contract.  
The meter number is 4371201 and is at Hastings.  This meter is gathering 
dry.  This meter was a new meter set and will probably begin flowing at the 
end of October.  It is estimated to produce about 30 dths a day.  Please 
forward this on to anyone that needs to schedule this gas.  I'm not real sure 
who is doing your noms on CNG.

Thanks,
Heidi

This schedule just covers agencies with CES and CEM.  For most pipelines, It 
does not cover contracts where CES is acting as agent for another 
counterparty.  

Call if you have questions.

Colleen, this is the email response I received.  

Kim, could you find out from payables if we are making payments to a company 
called "Capacity Center"?  If we are, I would like to know who with Enron is 
authorizing these payments.

Thanks.

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

Just a note to let you know Columbia Gas has some capacity postings on the 
EBB for next winter.  BIDS ARE DUE 3/15 AT 9AM.
Attached is a spreadsheet showing the parcel numbers.  I highlighted the 
meters that you did not have enough capacity to serve your load this winter.
I would be happy to bid on this as your agent, but let me know what rate 
works based on your economics.  This is a bid process, so the current low bid 
is just an indication of the market value of the capacity.

Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May.  
This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this 
capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.  

I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take the 
space if we don't have to.

Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management 
group.

I need to check on this.  I need to make sure we are not paying for this.  If 
it turns out to be retail, I will make sure I give CES credit for the

Just found out that we have acces to 15,000 of Aritech's capacity on TCO for
Apr & May, for $0.01, primary COH 3-15. Can we replace capacity ENA bought for
4/1 and would there be any cost?

I had a Market Area demand charge on the Dec transport sheet that I just took 
out today.  The demand charge was on TRCO and it was for $65,250.00.  This 
should be a positive hit to the P&L.  You can flow this through Friday night 
if that would be easier.

Subject: Segmentation And Order 637 - Houston Meeting


July 21, 2000

To: All Operators, Producers, Shippers and Customers on the
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line System (Transco)

RE: Modifications to Capacity Release Processes and Segmentation
and Order 637 Compliance filings

On June 30, 2000 Transco made a compliance filing with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in Docket No. RP00-17-000.
This filing proposed several changes to the Capacity Release and
capacity segmentation procedures that are to become effective for
business beginning gas day September 1, 2000.  A customer meeting
will be held in Washington DC on August 1, 2000 at 10:00 a.m.
(please see the Transit posting dated July 14, 2000) and in Houston
on August  3, 2000 at the Williams Tower, Level 5, Dining Room C
at 1:00 p.m.  The Houston meeting will address both the segmentation
changes and highlights of Transco's Order 637/637A Compliance filing,
with segmentation being discussed from 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. and the
Order 637 discussed from 3 p.m. - 5 p.m.  In order to finalize
the appropriate arrangements for the meeting, Transco requests
that you notify Liz Laurel at 713-215-2069 by Monday,
July 31, 2000.

There are two key elements to the proposed changes
in Docket RP00-17-000:
1.  Use of "Master" FT-R Commodity Contracts
Transco will no longer use the "Master" Commodity Form of Service
Agreement for reservation rate capacity releases.  Historically,
Transco has required capacity release shippers to execute two FT-R
contracts upon their initial acquisition of released capacity:
the FT-R Demand contract and the FT-R "Master" Commodity contract.
With subsequent reservation rate releases, shippers were only
required to execute new FT-R Demand contracts.  Each FT-R Demand
contract was specific to a capacity release deal and the FT-R
"Master" Commodity contract was used for all nomination and
commodity billing purposes.

Effective with business for gas day September 1, 2000, Transco will
require shippers acquiring capacity through reservation rate
capacity releases to execute and nominate transportation on each
new FT-R Demand contract.  This will require new activities to be
created for each capacity release contract.  For any capacity release
deals that span the August 31 - September 1 period, nominations for
gas day August 31, 2000 will be on the existing "Master" Commodity
contract and nominations for gas day September 1, 2000 will be new
transactions on the FT-R Demand contract.  Additionally, all
commodity billing will be done on the FT-R Demand contract.

Transco will send a "Notice of Termination" to all FT-R "Master"
Commodity contract holders identifying the contract that will
terminate as well as a list of all of the FT-R Demand contracts
that will continue to be effective in September.

2. Limiting nominations within a segment
Consistent with FERC's ruling in this docket and consistent with
similar rulings on Tennessee and Texas Gas, Transco will limit the
quantity of gas that can be scheduled  IN ANY SEGMENT of the
pipeline to the original firm contracted capacity.
Transco will aggregate all nominations under an original FT
contract and any related capacity release contracts
(or subsequent re-releases) to ensure that the total scheduled
quantity for the family of contracts is within the original
contractual entitlement.  If nominations for the family of
contracts exceed the original entitlement, nominations using
any secondary capacity rights will be considered as secondary
nominations and subject to cut on a pro-rata basis.

As stated above, Transco intends to implement these changes for gas
day September 1, 2000.  In the event systematic changes cannot be
completed or the FERC directs Transco to modify its planned
implementation, Transco will notify customers via TRANSIT of any
business practice changes as well as the expected implementation
timeline.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact
your Customer Services Representative or Scheduling Analyst.

I updated the Iroq and Tenn rates and fuel on the Boston Gas worksheet.  I 
couldn't make changes to the original sheet so I created a new one.

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

Refunds are always so much fun.  I suppose we would need to give some back to 
BUG if this happens.

Subject: FW: Transco Files Motion For Modification of Settlement




Just wanted to make sure all of you saw this notice that we posted on the 
bulletin board last week.? This may mean significant $$$ for some of you.? In 
brief, we are filing a request to make an early partial refund.? The refund 
is related to the rate of return settlement in our last rate filing.? 
According to the rate case proceedings, the refund is not due until a final 
non-appealable order is issued, but we are requesting permission to do a 
partial refund sooner (around Oct 31).? As the bulletin states, if your 
company wishes to wait to receive its full refund after the final, 
non-appealable order, please notify me or another Transco rep.

Happy Halloween.?? ii

To:? Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and 
Shippers 

Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to 
??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds 
??? Docket Nos. RP97-71-000 and RP97-312-000 

In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a 
Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial 
Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion, 
Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the 
January 20, 1998 Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to 
make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting 
Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return 
Issues on or about October 31, 2000. The refund is being made to 
parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set 
forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate 
the effects of current high natural gas prices on their 
customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed 
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to 
Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets. 

Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on 
or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the 
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to 
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the 
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 1997 
through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have 
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the 
Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No. 
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues, 
subject to the "refund floor". These interim partial refunds will 
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any 
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for 
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon 
request. 

If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim 
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final 
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital 
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds 
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non- 
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on 
or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in 
the interim partial refunds.

I just created deal 149901, an Equitrans, capacity deal.  I populated all the 
fields because Sylvia Campos had created the information prior to my creating 
the deal.  After I released the deal, the pipeline contract and agency 
contract disappearred.

No home yet. May have to take to Penn Fuel.  I left a message with Equitable 
to see if they are interested in Peoples, EOG, Equitrans and Penn Fuel.
What are you going to do with the CPA.  Bary Vanderhorst w/EES might be 
interested.  If not I wll contact Equitable.

I will contact Dominion to see if they are interested in any of this gas.

I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate

the EOG and 
Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.

Hey Team.  Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans 
market and we still have the production.  For July, take all of this gas into 
CNG.  You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara.  You 
should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup.


You are all wonderfull people  - I will make this free pop Friday (Wooo Hooo).

thanks

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will
need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

I do not know the meter number.  I just know the OP area and Mkt area, I am 
not
aware of the MLI as I did not anticipate working from home I did not bring my
chart with me.  Please look it up.      NYSEG Op 2 Mkt 21  - the mli will be
listed if you look up NYSEG in Op 2 Mkt 21.
Joann could help you with this if you all don't have access to this

Hey guys,

Just wanted to confirm that that NIMO gas 300 East Meter and actually just 214
to the West Meter was purchased through the EOM.

ALSO

At NYSEG, I need to purchase TCO  300dth/day from 1/27 to 1/31 to send to Mkt
21.  I believe that it is Op 2, Mkt 21, please check with Joann Collins to
double check that Op area, I don't have my chart with me.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks!

Chris,
This morning I sent  you a fax regarding Power Gas Marketing's May East Ohio 
contract volume.  As per the fax, this gas did not get nominated, thus Power 
Gas Marketing was "cashed out" by EOG.  Power Gas will be sending ENA an 
invoice for $3,443.15 for the difference between the contract price and the 
"cash out" price plus pooling fees.

Wade, 
You may want go get a copy of the fax and the backup I faxed to Chris, or I 
can fax a copy to you.
Has the May PMGT East Ohio invoice been paid?  

John

Just found out that we have acces to 15,000 of Aritech's capacity on TCO for
Apr & May, for $0.01, primary COH 3-15. Can we replace capacity ENA bought for
4/1 and would there be any cost?

Use the "Daily Activity" worksheet in this file.  The CES storage balance as 
of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth (see balance in cell L146).  The actual sale to 
CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and 
monthly activity.

If I remember correctly, the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the 
beginning balance.  There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st.  To 
correct for this, we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on 
April 30th was 13%.

Let me know if you have questions.

Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF 
+.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.

The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on 
CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover 
the ANR variable cost plus $.02.

Is this something Scott did for you?  He has been handling all the TCO 
activity.  Let me know if this is something I need to do.

We need something from TCO to confirm that we matched those bids and have that

FYI  --  Press Release received this morning:

Cove Point LNG to Begin Open Season Process For Capacity at its LNG Receiving 
Terminal 
? 
02/16/2000 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2000, PR Newswire) 

HERNDON, Va, Feb. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a 
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, announced today that it will conduct an 
open season from February 16 to March 16, 2000, for a firm LNG tanker 
discharging service at its Cove Point LNG terminal. The new service will 
include the unloading of LNG from tankers, LNG storage, vaporization, and 
delivery of natural gas to points along Cove Point's existing pipeline.   

Cove Point LNG is offering 750,000 dekatherms per day of deliverability and 
4.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of vapor equivalent storage capacity initially. 
The service includes a proposed expansion of the available storage capacity 
to 6.75 Bcf approximately one year after the start-up of the LNG receiving 
operations. Pending approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
Cove Point LNG plans to begin the LNG tanker discharging service by late 
2001. 

Located in Lusby, Md., the Cove Point LNG terminal includes liquefied natural 
gas storage and terminal operations, and an 87-mile natural gas pipeline that 
connects with gas pipelines in Northern Virginia. The terminal has installed 
send-out capacity of 1 Bcf of gas per day. With the proposed storage 
expansion, total LNG storage at Cove Point will be 7.5 Bcf of vapor 
equivalent natural gas. The Cove Point LNG terminal currently provides "peak 
shaving" services to customers in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions.  

Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading 
energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its 
operating companies engage in virtually all phases of the natural gas 
business, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and 
distribution, as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum 
product sales, and electric power generation. Information about Columbia 
Energy Group (NYSE: CG) is available on the Internet at 
www.columbiaenergygroup.com.   

This press release contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning 
of the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning, on a 
consolidated, segment or subsidiary basis, Columbia's plans, objectives and 
expected performance. There can be no assurance that actual results will not 
differ materially due to various factors, many of which are beyond the 
control of Columbia, including, but not limited to, the regulatory approval 
process, competition, weather, supply and demand for natural gas, and changes 
in general economic conditions.

Singer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Re: storage clarification & issues  

Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2:  The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month 
changes does appear to be an issue.  Since the contract didn't spell out in 
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we 
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly 
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.  I know Chris 
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not 
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.  I will ask that he forward 
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.  Let me know if 
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3.  Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms 
here.   Here is what is happening:  Your people are nominating this 
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), 
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.  That 
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are 
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between 
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual 
contract prices with the producers.  So, this is one issue we will have to 
address as indemnification items.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that I 
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all 
the nominations.  We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is 
what you want).  For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the 
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from 
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll 
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4.  Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like 
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the 
pipeline invoices on to you.  Maybe we should change this process to one 
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his 
confirmation and review of all the charges.  This means you may see quite a 
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.  Let us know what 
you would prefer.  Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that 
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to 
your office yesterday, March 29.  Chris will get all remaining demand charge 
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is 
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.  I apologize for the delay.

5.  Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a 
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on 
Monday.  Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you?  If not, please 
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory 
balances.

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

before the agency contract is in Global.  That makes things quicker for Scott

I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet.  I would like to discuss 
our options on handling the pool with Heidi, hopefully after the July 4th 
holiday.  

I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before.

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.


If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 
9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month.

Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts?  Power Gas 
expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

Subject: EOG for July, Peoples

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Colleen has signed the letter and it has been FedX for arrival at TCO 
tomorrow.

Susan Wade is presently upset that we are using Team 3 and not her  Team. She 
overheard Chris Germany talking to Steve Stonestreet today. She overheard 
Cindy Burnette working on Union Camp for me yesterday. We need someone from 
Enron to smooth this over with her.

Please decide who will be giving Susan Wade the courtesy call about the 
change. Not sure what timing is best... today or tomorrow.

Thank you.

I just noticed that ENA is still agent for CES and CEM on Transco.  If we no 
longer have a need to be agent, I think we should terminate those agencies.

I faxed a copy of the PSNC invoice for March to Brian Perrone.  I show this 
as a purchase from CES at St 85.  Also, I believe March is the last month CES 
is taking the gas from CES.

Brian, I'm tossing my copy, let me know if you have questions.

Somehow they broke the program rules - I will have to check that out - deal 
229101 was supposed to be ENA-IM EAST as a secondary desk to the BUG deal.   
They were able to save it as BUG as the secondary - which they should not be 
able to do - as this breaks the one deal rule per business unit per contract 
per time perod. 

I cleaned up the deals for you - it is the only way I could make sure it 
worked - and removed the evergreen flag off the the BUG deal. 

There are 3 more deals that have May forward activity - can you follow up on 
these - don't forget to cancel the evergreen on the service deals or they 
will just keep rolling.

Are you ready for some FOOTBALL!!!  Sorry - that was just running thru my 
head.  I am about to start sending everything I have to all you fine people.

Transport
I have the CES transport split between Wholesale and Retail.  For the 1st, 
all CES transport will be in a file all to itself.  The file is located 
at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls.   We have most of the 
retail contacts in Sitara, there should be a deal number in column U.

Most of our transport problems for the 1st will come from the asset 
management deals. Ex.  Tennessee MUNi's.  How many of these are there??  Good 
question.

Good Luck

Have fun ;)

Effective 04/1/2000, Columbia Gas Transmission will be transferring certain 
facilities to Gatherco, Inc.  There should have been a message in Columbia 
Navigator stating that there were certain meters that were going out of your 
IPP pool 37147 effective 4/2000.  The subject for this e-mail message was 
"Appalachian Meter Allocation".  The meters listed in this e-mail will now be 
on Gatherco's gathering lines and are going to be subject to the $.25 
gathering rate.  Per Dave Fusek at Gatherco, our final estimates for 04/2000 
SHOULD reflect these meters that were changed from Columbia Gas Transmission 
to Gatherco.  He said he is not 100% positive that they will get this 
finished in time, but they are hoping to have everything complete by the time 
they release our nominations.

Gloria and Wade,

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these 
meters.  Some of these meters were previously subject to Columbia's $.27 
gathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any 
gathering.  Again, these meters will now have a $.25 gathering charge.


Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heidi Griffith

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  7/31(7/31A) and
8/1(7/31B) and  the following day(s) as listed .    There are three  
worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Subject: CGAS Storage

I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this 
ticket), 268090, and 268093.

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this 
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the 
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

Let me know if you have any questions.

On the Tennessee side this deal was handled as a Back to Back and was 
therefore
not 'scheduled' so I really never dealt with the particulars of this deal.  I
will try and dig up whatever info I can find on this issue.

Just got off of the phone with Enron.   Due to the meter bounce that they are
doing because of the restriction, there will be a  reduction @ the gate (meter
#52) of 370 dth.   Donna, you originally requested 2050 dth, it will now be
1680 dth.   I have been told that you should see the entire 1680 dth.
Unfortunately, you will have to redo your Boston noms.

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange


I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.

Hope - approximately 1224 dth per day (this does not include Bayer and Eagle
Glass will swing)

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4585 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 382 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like 
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?

I have downloaded all the documentation that Ron Thompson (CES fuel 
management rep in Pittsburgh) has sent to Enron. It is located on the common 
drive under o:\logistics\gas\eastdesk\tco\calp and 
o:\logistics\gas\eastdesk\tco\gelp. I've printed most of the documentation if 
anyone wants a copy, just let me know.

It will probably be more efficient to have one primary scheduling contact for 
daily Cogen nominations (transport scheduler... Joann Collins for right now). 

However, there appears to be a lot of administrative work for Calp and Gelp. 
I'm going through the downloads from Ron and will figure out what needs to be 
done. I'll be the lead for Calp/Gelp from the administrative work 
perspective. Ron's last day is March 31st.... so we have one more month of 
his expertise!!!

Thanks everyone!!!

The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the 
information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling 
so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the 
pipeline?

Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges 
that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb.
Are you working on getting contracts and deals added?

Chris--see Melissa's note below.....per her note it would appear that part of 
the capacity we valued in the Wholesale book (not Retail) was not really 
capacity they owned.  Can you give me the details on this capacity--what term 
they gave it to us for, rate, receipt and delivery points, volume, etc.  Then 
we need to look at what impact it will have to take it out of the book.  
Thanks for the help.

Colleen,

As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium
Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
how to best proceed with correcting this situation.

Now for the good news, He wants to set in with the ya'll when you meet with
Mary.   I'd just have the meeting then tell him about it.  He also wants them
off the place in 14 days.   I told him no, to chill and that we will buy him
out.   That should hold him off a few days.   So don't move yet on getting my
money together?

Took Barb out to eat last night at Johnny Correno's.   No motorcycle riding 
for
me.

Oh yeah, Don is going to see the Dr. about something to help with his nerves 
and
to stop smoking.  He is going to tell him he is drinking with the stuff that 
he
is taking.   Maybe the Doc can give him something to help settle down all this
hostility.

I'll work on the inventory list tonight.   You need to pull together all the
finical data, CD's etc. that are out and that we  cashed in.   Then we will
stick in new values.  Also need to give a good fair market value on items we 
are
selling so we do not have to pay tax on the stuff right.  If we value the 
place
at $175,000 and sell for less, then we don't have to pay taxes on the money, 
so
I was told.


See Ya.

Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now.
We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary
(be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.

She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide
the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's
lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal
thinks we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.

I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.  Do you care?

I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major
frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.  Hope for the best!!

Later

I will receive a final number for these next week but this is an estimate.
(should not be that far off).

Here is a quick and dirty worksheet.  I've been trying to come up with a 
total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2".  The storage numbers and choice 
numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes 
are on "Sheet 1".

Dan does not know what this contract is used for.  I think it has (or had) 
something to do with the Boston Gas contract.  We currently use k#29667 for 
that.  I would like to terminate deal 77257 effective 6/30/2000.

Comments / questions?

Any concerns to forward to Becky Cantrell by Friday the 11th of Aug.???? We 
currently only have a 2017 dkt/d term contract #125005, a 35,465 dkt/d term 
contract #125008, an IT contract and a parking and loaning contract to handle 
our Canadian term supply.  We typically transport to markets off Iroquois, to 
Tennnessee pipeline and CNG pipeline.  That is a simplified summary of our 
daily activity on Iroquois.  If you need any information, please let me 
know.

Subject: Iroquois Gas

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago, 
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented 
capacity.  Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the 
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement 
shipper.  Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not) 
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible.  For instance, 
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the 
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy 
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on 
Iroquois' system?  Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments 
on this issue.  I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

Thanks.

Subject: Allied Deals

In reconciling with CES I have come across deal numbers 144284, 229286, and 
232373 that have CES as the counterparty but in the terms they show the deal 
is actually with Allied.  CES has paid everything we invoiced them, including 
these three deals, but they have admitted that they are unfamiliar to them.  
I have not said anything to CES yet.  Do we need to change the counterparty 
or what action should we take?

Thank You,

Molly

Chris,

A couple of years ago the East and the Central Desks decided that Empire 
State Pipeline in NY would
be changed from an "East Desk pipeline" to a "Central Desk pipeline" in our 
scheduling and accounting
systems.  The reason for that decision was to fix the significant OA 
variances both desks were experiencing
by the Sithe book liquidations, and to better control and manage all the 
subtle little issues under the gas
sales agreement.  Since the only transaction that was being done on Empire 
was the Sithe deal, this 
approach has worked great and the OA and contract problems have been 
corrected. 

Over the last month or so, Sithe pointed out to us that some days CNG North 
Point gas prices were high 
enough so that Chippawa gas could be shipped over to CNG Lysander and still 
make a margin.  I talked 
to Geoff Storey about it and told him to keep that trade in mind.  At the 
time I assumed that Sithe's IT 
contract would be used to ship the volumes from Chippawa to one of the new 
interconnects with NFGS 
at Pendleton or CNG at Lysander and that we would just schedule it on the 
Central Desk and report the 
transactions under our monthly revenue sharing transactions with Sithe.

If ENA begins shipping gas on Empire under our own agreement, there are a 
couple things that I am very
concerned about:

 o   ENA has a contractual obligation to optimize Sithe's transportation 
assets & to split
       the incremental revenues with Sithe,
 o   Empire desperately wants to Sithe's new 750 MW plant to be served 
through Empire
       and if we start doing alot of IT business on Empire the word will 
probably get back to Sithe,
 o   I hope that Empire Pipeline continues to be a "Central Desk pipeline" in 
our systems.  We can
       not go back to that mess we had before when the Sithe deal was split 
between two desks.

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, maybe we can get everybody together 
an make sure that we can
come up with a plan that works for everybody.

Thanks,
Ruth

I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel 
waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on 
the secondary capacity deal ticket?

Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing 
from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

Robert, let's deliver 1,000 day to Cove Point off CGAS for May.  That should 
give us 812 day injected for May.

This may change after I chat with Laura at Cove Point.  I knew we could 
deliver 4,000 day for April but she never told me what we could do for May.

Chris,
 Just to confirm with you about activity with Egan Hub, there was nothing for 
September production, however there was a park and loan deal for October.  If 
this is correct, could you please forward you spreadsheet with the details?  
I have not received anything from Egan confirming this or billing me for any 
fees associated with this deal.   Also, just to let you be aware of the 
imbalance left on the other storage activity that was bought from Columbia; 
we had an ending imbalance of 101 mmbtu due ENA.  If you need a copy of the 
Egan statement with this, please let me know, so I can forward a copy to you 
or whomever may need it.

Thanks,
Marlo

There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the 
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of 
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.  
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Thanks

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still 
billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 
3/31/2000.
  The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.  

It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.

Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 
equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we 
should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal 
227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the 
credit either today or tomorrow.

Thanks.

Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non 
bidable.  Scott, it looks recallable.  Its parcel number 28464.  Vol=7500, 
receipt point is Leach, delivery point is City of Richmond.  The rate is 
$2.40 = $.08.

Everything looks good except the recallable factor.



Also, there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate, offer #28446.  
I can't get my machine to print out the forms.

Good Luck.

Hey team.

I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New 
Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New 
Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the 
following FOM numbers

1st-6th  51,762
7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through 
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.

I created deal 516907 as a physical forward sale to Oglethorpe Power.

Jim, Judy has told me that under no circumstances should I be involved with 
Ogy unless she is out.  But she also said she will gladly fix any deal entry 
misstakes I make.  I humbly accept my position.

Robin only bought 2074 dt's for the 2nd.  According to the sheet, the Tenn Z6 
volumes were 2220 dt's.  I told Brian at CES we were going to short Energy 
North by 146 dt's (the requested 1227 dt's but we only have 1081 dt's).  

Please let me know how you sourced the gas.

the Lilco capacity CES Retail receives each month.  This credit should be

Please unvalidate deal 229101 so I can change the buyer from ENA - Im Bug to 
ENA - Im Market East.

This transport contract is set up under ENA - Im Bug twice (deal 229101 and 
77563)

Thanks.

I also need to make sure the end term date on both deals is 3/31/2000.

I've entered a mother load of comments on all the deals.  please let me know 
when you validate these or what else you need.

Kimat, the exchange deals were not validated yesterday.  Did this have a big 
p&l impact?  My TCO schedulers said there volumes were off by about 6 BCF.

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange


I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.

Attached are the purchases and sales with New Power for the month of

The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/25/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled "Comments".   The only changes
versus yesterday's transmittal are to NIPSCO and to AGL volumes.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

Subject: Equitrans

I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?  
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts 
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).  
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe 
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my 
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing 
shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks

Subject: CES Retail capacity

Per our discussion on Monday, we need to give CES-Retail a bid for the two 
TCO transportation contracts that were dedicated to c&i customers that they 
will no longer need once they sell their c&i business effective 6/1/00.  As 
you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/00 (#65402); 
the other is to BG&E  for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403).  This is the 
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that 
this information is accurate.

I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest 
that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements.  I think 
this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it 
up!!).    If there is any problem with this, please let me know.

sstonestreet@columbiaenergygroup.com, Molly Johnson/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Storage on TCO - PLEASE READ

To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had 
a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have 
misstated something, please let us know.

There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum 
withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached 
spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know 
its different volume requirements.

Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum 
Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ)  based on Enron's SCQ. There is no 
Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO.

TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ;

April = 15%
May = 20%
June = 20%
July = 20%
Aug = 20%
Sept = 13%
Oct = 7 %

If you add these months up, the total Injection is 115%. Essentially, 
shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection 
period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is 
5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done).

For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April 
(15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to 
catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the 
ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval 
(I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve 
overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus 
overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full. 


Some other basic rules;

Shippers do not have to fill storage 100% by October.

Shippers cannot have more than  60% in storage by June 1st, unless 
overinjection is approved by TCO.

Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same 
way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the 
MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324. 
Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember 
Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need 
to be used to avoid overrun charges.


Why do we care about all of this....

Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still 
uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for 
Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay 
below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we 
will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for 
overinjections above 36,304.

TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far. 
April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems 
running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run 
the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these 
reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or 
overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a 
volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing  
penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt.

Please save this note for future reference.

Per John Whited, Effective May 1st, 2000:

Aristech will be managed by Strategic Energy (Hans Rottman.... former CES 
employee... who originally got this account).

Enron will no longer do the agency nominations for Aristech.

Jesse/Cindy/John; please check if the term supply deal from Columbia Gulf for 
Aristech goes  past April 30, 2000.

Scott/Chris/Jeff/John; please determine how you want to handle the release of 
Aristech's transport to CES in May 2000.

Special Note:
This concludes all agency deals that Enron TCO staff was scheduling for CES. 
There are no more agency deals.

People,

The Fundy site now has updated price indices for both the east and west 
desks.  "EOM Price Index" is now "EOM East Price Index" and for the west 
desk, it is Price Data/EOM West Price Index.  Feel free to give me a shout if 
you have further queries.

You know, I gave you the wrong daily volume for the month of May.  I'm just 
going to change it effective 5/16/2000 so that the total volume for the month 
is correct.

Subject: CES Storage

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

Aug should be 1,089,109, Sep is good and Oct should be 121,013. Apr was 
786,579
while May, Jun & Jul were same as Aug. Your total for 7/31 is OK. Remember
these are theoretical numbers by which you bill CES/NPC. They also don't 
divide
by 30 or 31 so it is hard to make a daily injection add up.

Following up from my earlier e-mail regarding the primary receipt capacity on 
the CNG FT contract associated with the Cove Point gas;
CNG has indicated that on a peak day they would restrict  the PL1 system to 
primary receipts and deliveries consequently eliminating the WGL redelivery 
option that VNG has utilised in the past several years to deliver the Cove 
Point gas via CNG.  I called Williams to ask if the Cove Point gas that ENA 
has this winter could deliver into CNG, the answer was clearly not until 
April 2002 due to a pressure problem on the Cove Point side.  
I think the emphasis should shift to AGL to pressure TRANSCO to fulfil their 
contractual arrangement or at least provide a financial settlement.
Let me know if I can help in any way.

Scott & Chris-

This is mainly just an FYI so everyone has all the same information.  Earlier 
today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up 
the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any 
longer.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT 
Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business.    
Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a 
lot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some 
negotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees 
until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing, 
but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied 
to the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering 
his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their 
customer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their 
other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process 
confidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other 
questions about this conversation, please let me know. 

Scott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.   

Just as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing 
a hub service for Transco right now.

 Thanks!  -Angie

Joanie's email to me about the Roanoke  pricing has me curious.  Do I need to 
check the pricing on all the wholesale CES deals?

I do have some reports which Paul Drexelius gave me in January out of CES's 
GMS system.  Dick had asked me to sit with Paul one afternoon and talk about 
the deals.  I have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals 
in Sitara.

Let me know if you want me to audit Sitara.

Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278.  
Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal.  The volume is currently 2187 dth per 
day.  Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow.

Robert, could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info?  They 
should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool.

Thanks

The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.  We are using ENA transport and 
the deliveries are on a secondary basis.  The deal number is 322199 and I 
added the meter numbers that I used to enter the deals.  Robert, Joann, the 
volumes should not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from 
all other deals.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers
behind COH.  Its a similar situation to the one we had in June with C&I
customers taken over from us by Metromedia Energy.  We need to do a separate
deal to cover these volumes like we did in June.
Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.

Hey team.

I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New 
Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New 
Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the 
following FOM numbers

1st-6th  51,762
7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through 
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.

The attached file contains CES's first-of-the-month daily volume requirements
for August 2000.  This request is submitted 3 business days prior to NYMEX
close for the month of August.   The file contains volumes to be delivered to
the citygate as well as volumes to be injected into storage consistent with 
the
theoretical storage injection schedule.


Please note that for the month of August '00 CES is not purchasing additional
volumes of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate 
deal,
as was done in June and July.   Also, CES is not ordering any volumes in 
August
for Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal) which ceased to be a CES customer at 
the
end of March 2000.


Please call me if you have questions or problems with the attached request.

This is the way I show the Dayton Power exchange deal starting 1/21/2000, 
please let me know if this is incorrect.

ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate.  In return, Dayton is giving ENA 
gas at various CGAS citygates.  There are no fees for this transaction.  The 
TGT deal is 152766, the CGAS deal is 153213.  The volumes on these deals 
should match.  Also, Dayton should not be using any ENA supply (pool gas or 
ENA storage) to supply the CGAS citygate volume.

Comments/questions?

Victor, I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal.  

Also, it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara.

Steve--The attached file contains estimates for the upcoming 12-month period 
of
our monthly flowing volume requirements for the NIPSCO Choice program,
including estimated peak-day requirements (part of which come out of
storage).   I am referring to the values in Cols. L,M, and N in the attached.
Can you please give us a price quote for getting these volumes to the NIPSCO
citygate?

Please call me if you have questions.

Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please 
forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.

The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The 
demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating 
correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective 
June 1.

Please look at the following contracts/deals.

Contract Deal  Comment
779234  003589  Boston releasing to CES
771157  003668  CES releasing to ENA
771224  003786  ENA releasing to Energy Express

779233  003581  Boston releasing to CES
771156  003666  CES releasing to ENA

East Ohio
I created deal 348393 (sale to EES).  This deal should get matched with the 
purchase from Power Gas Marketing, deal 264613 for July and August.  The deal 
volume is 10,000 for the month.  We have the Power Gas deal thru October.  We 
still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone.

I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is 0, so I entered an 
expected volume of 0 on the EES deal.  I didn't want to mess anything up so 
close to nom time.  Please put 10,000 for the month on both deals for July.

Thanks.


Peoples
I changed the volume on deal 264595 to 3500 for the month.  This volume 
fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume.  This 
deal also goes through October.

We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company.  I did not 
see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434, the price needs to 
be corrected.  This deal goes through November.  The estimated volume for 
August is 300 per day, this volume also fluctuates each month..

We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton, deal 348443.  The price on 
this deal is CNG IF per mcf.  Clinton will pay us based on actuals.

Let me know if anyone has questions.

Hi gang.  I'm fairly certain I entered this parking deal wrong for Feb.  We 
will have to look at it next week.

Deal 162283 and 162282.  We parked gas at S. Commack on Iroq and I think the 
counterparty should be CPR Exchange as opposed to Iroquois. 

we will chat.

I thought you all may be interested in a summary of the FERC Conference I 
attended on Tuesday.  The comments below are from Becky Cantrell and Shelley 
Corman.  I will also forward the comments from our Washington attorney, who 
also attended the conference.  We have 30 days to file comments on the 
meeting.  There are a couple of issues I want to discuss with you that will 
help us decide whether we should file certain comments.  I will arrange a 
meeting soon.

Subject: Memo from Shelley Corman: FERC Staff Conference Today

I generally concur with Shelley's summary.    On the fourth bullet in the 
first section (tighter tolerances), a lot of parties (more than I expected) 
kvetched about the fact that pipelines seemed to be using the Order 637 
filings to make their penalty provisions even worse -- higher fees, tighter 
tolerances -- and then proposing new default or mandatory services that 
looked a lot like penalties.  

There was the usual affiliate bashing, particularly on the 
shipper-must-have-title rule discussions.  Southern Company also brought it 
up in connection with LNG import facilities, e.g., Cove Point and Elba 
Island.  It seems pretty clear that the January conference, which is to 
address marketing affiliates, will be pretty heated.  Based on their comments 
in this conference, I expect BP/Amoco is going to be particularly aggressive 
(rabid, even), and Dynegy will almost certainly be chiming in.  We need to 
start developing a strategy to counter some of their most virulent arguments.

Subject: Memo from Shelley Corman: FERC Staff Conference Today

Today, FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are 
necessary to promote further market liquidity.  The conference was fairly 
well attended by FERC staff, including Dan Larcamp and  Shelton Cannon.  

Some common themes:
Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not 
necessary.
Commodity markets are very liquid.
FERC policies, GISB and Order 637 have helped to make capacity markets more 
liquid.
Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in 
Order No. 637 compliance filings.
Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity (with pipelines making the 
distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea, 
standardization of product offerings is not).
There is very little consensus on further areas for change.  In nearly every 
case, a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another.  
In any event, most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes.

Areas without consensus:
Shipper-must-have-title rule.  LDCs argue it should be removed; while Process 
Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release 
market.
Production area rate design.  LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy 
service downstrream of a market pool.  Reliant and Koch also argued that 
pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates.  
The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area.
SFV.  East Coast LDCs, Michcon, and APGA argued for moving off of SFV.  The 
producers and industrials oppose.  Illinois Power/Dynegy also argued for 
moving off SFV.  


LDC Positions
The LDCs main themes were removing the shipper-must-have-title and enabling 
LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers.  However, they also argued 
that  pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric 
generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically 
enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs .   This is the point that AGA 
raised in the blanket intervention to all Order 637 compliance filings.    
Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are 
entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a 
best efforts basis, perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not 
have been fully subscribed.  LDCs, generally stating that 637 compliance 
filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation, continued to stress 
the need for segmentation, including "geographical segmentation of ROFR 
capacity."  

Some Specific Proposals
NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form 2 filings.  
A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information, 
though specific needs were not well defined.
Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties 
(especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for 
arbitrage).
Alliance of Energy Suppliers (marketing arm of EEI) called for a dialogue 
between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly 
variability.  They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to 
match the power grid (Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to 
standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well).
The GISB End-User group (represented by Salt River Project)  complained about 
the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas 
transactions to be "tagged" like electric transactions.  

E-Commerce and Capacity Trading
Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity 
trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy 
transactions, remove posting periods and long contract execution periods.  He 
made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary.  
Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme, admonishing the 
FERC not to micro-manage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist 
on a single platform.  He said that liquidity cannot be legislated.  From his 
perspective, natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets 
in the world.  FERC should worry about transferring the "good stuff" from 
natural gas to electric markets, not the reverse.

Clarissa, what did you find out about me receiving different volumes at Boston
than what I requested.  We are penalized for over or under deliveries to that
pool.  We are now in "critical day" status, which means that we are charged 5
times the daily index, which is GDA plus some other charges. It is very
important that I receive exactly the volume requested.  Please talk with the
shipper and ask that they adjust the volume each day as requested.

I know that these are small voumes, but we have to play by the rules.

Day 1, requested 75, received 82
Day 2, requested 97, received 100
day 3, requested 87


For the weekend, I have changes only going to the Boston meter.

The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for  08/30 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\Aug_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Brenda - isn't there a Cornwell pool and Hastings pool that is not an 
imbalance account?
ESOG does not carry an imbalance, but right now I cannot enter any volumes in 
these imbalance
accounts.  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day.  This would 
be
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable 
for
penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.

Subject:  Updated Mar'00 Requirements



Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00.
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you
yesterday.  Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes),
the
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were
only
picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the
attached version.

Sorry for any confusion.

Just a quick note to check the status of the Boston Gas program.  Can you 
confirm that the capacity will be recalled from ENA and reput to Metromedia 
for July?  Last week Boston said the paperwork from both parties was not 
completed.

Please Advise.

The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco.

Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals.  Tetco doesn't know 
how this gas flows.  They are still checking into this one.  It may actually 
flow into CNG.,



Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters.  This gas is a backhaul 
to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a 
forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford.  The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11%.

I'm running a temp today and threw up a bunch last night.   If I don't shake

Attached are two documents containing the regulatory summaries for this 
period.  The first is the same document you are used to seeing--a summary of 
all types of filings made by the pipelines to FERC.  The second is a special 
document that contains only the Order 637 compliance filings that have been 
made.  As I'm sure most of you are aware, each pipeline must make a filing 
indicating how it intends to comply with the new Order 637 regulations.  For 
your convenience I have included in the second attachment an explanation of 
the new Order 637 requirements, followed by the compliance filings that I 
have received to date.   I will update this document as new filings are 
received.  If you have any questions, I may be reached at x35514.

Could you see if the retail people could use this worksheet format? We may 
not be able to do this for everything but I believe we could use this format 
for Tennessee, CNG, Tennessee, Tetco and Texas Gas (excluding AGL).  What do 
you think?

Here is a more updated volume breakdown.   We swing down on weekends (and
sometimes during the week if the customers shut down).   These volumes are 
good
except for Boston Gas and S. Ct.   We are waiting for the ldc demand curves 
and
Algorithms.   Those two ldc volumes represent our estimates.


Please let me know when you have a contract number.   Thanks.

Subject: 1st annual House Party

Well, now that I am somewhat settled into my new home (I'm still trying to 
hunt down a giant slip-n-slide for the backyard), it's time to throw a 
party.  This Saturday, April 15th at 7:30 pm, I will have my first official 
party to put the first beer stains on the new home.  Let's keep this pretty 
simple and painless, everybody just needs to bring a little something to 
drink and I will provide the rest.  I will have directions sitting on my desk 
to figure out how to get to Pearland, for all you inside the loop people 
don't be afraid, it's not that difficult and long of a drive.  

If you have any questions let me know and please pass this on to anybody I 
may have left off the list.


Hope to see you all Saturday,

Matt


Directions:

Take 288 S to the Pearland exit (CR 518) and take a left off the exit (going 
east).  You will stay on 518 for 1.2 miles.  After you come upon your third 
stop light you will make a right, this will be CR 90 ( there will be a strip 
mall on your right with a Domino's Pizza on the corner).  Travel on 90 for 
1.8 miles until you dead end.  This will take you to CR 101, which you will 
take a left on.  Stay on CR 101 for 0.4 miles until you see Kennedy Rd and 
take a left.  My house is the first house on your left-hand side once you 
turn onto Kennedy.  3606 Kennedy Drive   281-692-9255

Subject: January 2000 Tn Zn 6 volumes

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 markets until Monday, 12/27.  We will need a
range from 2800 dth to 3600 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for 
these
types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Here is the phone number for the kennel 281-449-3027.  Here's how you get 
there.  Take JFK (South - away from the airport) accross Beltway 8 to 
Aldine-Bender (next major intersection after the beltway).  Take a right on 
Aldine-Bender and go to the 2nd street which is Milner.  There are no lights 
at Milner and Aldine - you just have to watch for the road.  Go 1 block to 
Renton.  Take a left on Renton and its the 2nd or 3rd house down.

Attached is my demand charge worksheet for October.

Jeff, we should probably chat about the pricing.  I'll explain it to you when 
I get back.  On TCO, I averaged everything together and entered a fixed price 
on the big citygate deal.

Subject: CES Booking of Transport--annuities to desk

I'd like to set up a meeting with the two of you (and whoever else you think 
needs to be there) to go over the booking of various deals.  For example, 
Dayton P&L--we pay out to them a big demand charge each month, but the desk 
should be getting an annuity payment back.  Where will they see this in their 
p&l?
CALP is another example.  Are you two available Tuesday around 12:00 to 
discuss?

I will make sure someone from the East Desk is there as well.  If there are 
any in the Central Region that are like this, let me know and I'll round up 
someone from that desk, too (unless you think they already know how theirs is 
working).

Thanks.

I ran a total on the Medicare Bills that I will be submitting to Dad's 
alternate
Insurance Co.   Most of these bills have been paid by Dow insurance so we are 
in
good shape as of $$ still owed.   Anyway when I finished compiling the list,
total was about $12,145.   I'm waiting on MD Anderson to sent me a copy of the
pathology report before I actually file.

Thought you guys might be interested to know this tad bit of info.

UGI ships the gas for CES.  Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA.  It looks 
like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months.  Doug will verify 
this information and let us know.

Cindy/CNG is looking at the park and loan deal.  She laughed when I said gave 
her the volume of 100,000.  The most she will consider is 50,000.  So I told 
her to look at a total storage volume of 50,000 and ENA would pay $4500.00 in 
demand charges each month.  She needs to think about it.  I'm out tomorrow 
but I will call her.

Also, we are actually looking at -25,000 to 25,000 and we would be billed 
fuel if the deal rolls from 1 month to the next.

This is gas that was missing from our first of the month volumes. that should
be within our 10% swing.  The scheduler told me there aren't any restrictions
currently and with the additional volumes we would be within our 10% swing.
Either way wouldn't this be billed at gas daily as long as we are not
restricted?

Joann,

Please redirect the following:

from mkt 7-3 cut 9039 dth total off K61822 (please prorate thru
ROM) take to 7-1

from mkt 7-8 cut 6413 dth total off K65402 (please prorate thru
ROM) take to 7-1

In addition to the redirects, I am also requesting more gas delivered to 7-1
from you, 13500 dth total, if you could please prorate that through the rest 
of
the month as well.

We can start this on the 12th if that works for you.

Thank you!
Kara

You left 2 TRCO invoice questions on my desk.

1.  Contract 3.3558 - this is a volumetric release from PSNC for CES Retail.  
The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe.

2.  Contract 3.3509 - ???  I don't understand this one.  Take a look at 
k#1.3473.  Did we receive a demand charge on 1.3473 and not have the demand 
estimated in Sitara?  I may need to add 1.3473 and 0 3.3509.  Let me know 
what you find.

Chris,

Have you been able to figure out if Enron has billed Ashland for Jan, Feb and
Mar on an old 1022/day Columbia contract?  If so, please let me know so we can
make the appropriate adjustment with the Ashland volumes.

Thanks

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There 
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  


Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd 
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

John

Small stuff is staggerd Choice Capacity from LDC, no problem. 10,000 and 8,000
packages appear to be winter supplies for C&I. As long as ENA buys monthly
capacity for C&I market that extra Choice capacity can't cover, we should be
OK.

I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel 
waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on 
the secondary capacity deal ticket?

Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing 
from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?

For the balance of March, CNG has granted ENA fuel waivers from 
Iroq/Canajoharie to the following CNG citygates; NIMO (East & West), NYSEG, 
and Hanley & Bird.  According to this morning's sheet, we are delivering 
about 11,000 dt to these 4 delivery points.


Following are 2 ways of getting the gas into CNG at Canajoharie.

1.  Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG.  At 
today's prices we save:
 
 Savings
 Tenn Variable $.0491   at $3.00
 CNG Fuel $.0672  at  $2.88
                                               ------------
 Total Savings $.1151
 
 At these prices, if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.1100, we 
should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie

2.  Buy Waddington, get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie.  We save the 
CNG fuel cost.  This usually only works when Iroq shows a discounted rate of 
$.04 to $.06.
 

Last year, CNG granted most of these fuel waivers all summer.

FYI!  Elvis Energy is adding a new meter set to their existing contract.  The 
meter will be at Bridgeport and is estimated to do about 15 dths a day.  The 
meter number is not known at this time, but the well name is Eulah Shaw #1 
and is located in Barbour County, WV.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heidi

DPL has issued a revised OFO for Thursday the 23rd and Friday the 24th.  I 
will
need to adjust my volumes as follows:

23rd - cut volume of 883 to 723 dth on TGT K# 6057 (was originally 1203 dth)

24th - cut volume of 823 to 622 dth on TGT K# 6057 (was originally 1203 dth)

25th - cut volume of 1203 to 662 dth on TGT k#6057

Effective the 26th - 31st, please keep my volumes at 1203 dth per day.

DPL may revise the 24th and 25th tomorrow.   I will update you tomorrow.
Thanks for your help.   (Kim is out today so you will need to contact me with
any questions).

Yes, the producer receives a fixed price, however, these deals are probably 
in TAGG as Nymex plus basis deals.  Phillips deal was transferred to ENA, 
Power Gas was triggered on ENA books.
Or does it matter???

So both of these suppliers are now fixed price because  they locked in the 
NYMX?

Hi everyone!!

I made it and my bags finally showed up... almost had to do a shopping trip.

My apartment is right across from the office and is very nice. Maryland is
beautiful and the weather is great... nice and cool... in the 60/70's! I
need my sweaters already.... who would have thought.

TCO (the pipeline I scheduled) is taking us to the Orioles game Friday.

Please note my e-mail has changed slightly... I know... I said it wouldn't.
Gen changed to neg. Neg is for National Energy Group. It was gen for US
Generating.

Looking forward to hearing from y'all and your visits!!!

Hey Chris, IT will fix the invoicing problem tomorrow.  I'm not sure how the

update tomorrow afternoon b/c I'll be out of the ofc in the a.m.  Thanks.

Notice to all Appalachian Pool Operators:           Received 3/29/00  2:00 pm
Reclassification Notice                            Posted 3/29/00  2:00 pm

On February 10, 1999, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549, granting CNG 
Transmission's (CNGT's) request for reclassification of various transmission 
lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission lines 
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to 
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   
On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting 
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  
The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, 
H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, 
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective 
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff 
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff 
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel 
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have 
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 
(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.

April 3, 2000                                                Received 4/3/00  
11:10 am
                                                              Posted 4/3/00  
11:10 am

Dear Pool Operator:

 CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings 
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance 
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires 
that the "wet gas" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no 
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations 
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions 
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed 
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.

 Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets 
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. 
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations 
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight 
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per 
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT 
considering 
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your 
pool.

 As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult 
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your 
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's 
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators 
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify 
producers individually.

 We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted 
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us 
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled 
shut       down will not be until 2002.

 If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to 
contact me at (304) 623-8698. 

      Sincerely,



      Nancy M. Aucremanne
      Manager, Producer Services
      And Business Agreements

Hey guys,

Just wanted to confirm that that NIMO gas 300 East Meter and actually just 214
to the West Meter was purchased through the EOM.

ALSO

At NYSEG, I need to purchase TCO  300dth/day from 1/27 to 1/31 to send to Mkt
21.  I believe that it is Op 2, Mkt 21, please check with Joann Collins to
double check that Op area, I don't have my chart with me.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks!

Subject: FINAL - January 2000 Tn Zn 6 volumes

Here are the January daily volumes for each of the gates.    I know you wanted
an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 
markets
until Thursday as Boston Gas and S. Ct. Algorithms will be available then.   I
have estimates in on those gates.  We will need a range from 2700 dth to 3600
dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of markets due to
weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Thanks for pointing this out.  To my knowledge we have never even tried to 
overlap the contract or do any segmenting.

Any concerns to forward to Becky Cantrell by Friday the 11th of Aug.???? We 
currently only have a 2017 dkt/d term contract #125005, a 35,465 dkt/d term 
contract #125008, an IT contract and a parking and loaning contract to handle 
our Canadian term supply.  We typically transport to markets off Iroquois, to 
Tennnessee pipeline and CNG pipeline.  That is a simplified summary of our 
daily activity on Iroquois.  If you need any information, please let me 
know.

Subject: Iroquois Gas

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago, 
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented 
capacity.  Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the 
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement 
shipper.  Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not) 
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible.  For instance, 
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the 
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy 
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on 
Iroquois' system?  Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments 
on this issue.  I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

Thanks.

Hey Anita, I changed the price and attached is my calculation.  Your rates 
are close enough as far as I'm concerned though.

I came up with $2.60218 on Cook School Road for March and $2.93210 for April
(using new fuel rate).  Maybe I'm calculating it wrong!  Tell me how you
calculated it.

For Nora I got the same rate you did $2.11

With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more 
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we 
are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the 
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would 
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the 
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the 
month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt 
and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it 
and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impact 
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let 
me know if you need specific capacity examples.

Dana, per the note you printed out and gave me.

CES gave Enron a riskworks data dump which had not been audited for correct 
pricing at CES. As you know GMS was used at CES for scheduling and billing.

This Dayton Deal was not input into Sitara. I created this deal ticket for 
volume/position not for pricing. Somebody on the CES transition team was 
suppose to verify pricing on all Northeast Deals that was input into Sitara. 
Printout of all Sitara deals was given to Phil Glaessner on January 19th. 
Paul Drexelius met with Scott Goodell and Chris Germany on February 8th to 
verify the pricing on these deals. Not sure how far Scott and Chris have 
gotten to correct the pricing on these deals starting with January 2000. 

Don't mean to pass the buck... but please check with Scott and Chris.

The GMS deal numbers are;

s-dp&L-0070 for 5000/day from 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
s-dp&l-0079 for 5000/day from 12/1/99 to 5/1/2000

I'm guessing the correct pricing exists on these GMS deal tickets and someone 
needs to correct the pricing on the Sitara deals.

This is probably not good news... there will be a ton of pricing 
discrepancies until someone ties GMS to Sitara.

I have all the CES and CEM capacity releases in Sitara  We have; 
 several contracts for Atlanta Gas Light - all CES, 
 we have 3 small Boston Gas deals on 1 contract in Z6 - all CES
 we have 1 z3 to Z6 deal from S. Jersey - on CEM

I still need to enter the PSNC capacity from St 85 to PSNC - real low on my 
priority list right now.

I sent Janet Edwards at CES a request to get ENA set up as agent for CEM - 
this has not been done yet.  

Please show this email to the CES Transco scheduler for confirmation.

ta da  :)

Sorry guys.  I'm still working on the February invoice to CES.  I estimate 
that everyday this invoice does not get out cost Enron about $4,000 a day.  
Feel free to call my boss Scott Neal about the problems you are having.

Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have 
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need 
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;

   "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they 
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks

The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM 
gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to 
get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and 
transmission contracts moved over.

I entered a demand charge on deal 396265.  This is a Market East desk deal.  
I tried to enter a demand charge on the original deal for Oct 1999 but I kept

Good job Chris.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  

Comments?

Subject: New Virus Alert !!!




New Virus Taking Offices By Storm
  This virus warning is genuine.

There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort
of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a
colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.

This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have
been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their
social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you
do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to
purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough
of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically
forget the "work".

If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and
drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to
the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum
punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work"
will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the
greatest cartoon ever.

You're probably gone anyway.  I'll think of this as "my note in a bottle".


Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the state fair every year. Every year
Stumpy would say, "Martha, I'd like to ride in that there airplane." And
every year Martha would say, "I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs
ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."

One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, "Martha, I'm
71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get
another chance." Martha replied, "Stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten
dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."

The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take
you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not
say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten
dollars."

Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists
and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks
over again, but still not a word.

They land and the pilot turns to Stumpy, "By golly, I did everything I
could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't." Stumpy replied,
"Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but ten dollars is
ten dollars."

I understand that contract 63304 is the retail FSS contract with a total 
capacity of 7,503,838.  I bill CES Retail for the demand charges on this.  
What is FSS contract 51407?

I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara;

Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing.

Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco, 
CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do).

Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF?  I think every time I create a VNG 
deal, a confirm is faxed to them.

AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as 
production area sales), please let me know.  The easiest way I can come up 
with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most 
of the pricing done in a worksheet.

Subject: Re: TCO STOW Overage - 1/24 - NEED ANSWER


What's the final answer.... do you need the enduser gas or do you want me
to cut the enduser gas? P

 If you really need the enduser gas... the only other option is for me...
is to beg TCO to let me inject some pool gas into storage for that gas day
to avoid the $10 withdrawal penalty... but we would still incur the overrun
charge plus the additional overrun charge to get the gas into storage. Need
a decision by 1 pm CST time on Monday, January 31st. Thank you!!!!

Please pass this note to Melissa... still don't have her e-mail address.

Can't wait for it to warm up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject:  TCO STOW Overage - 1/24

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted
amount (+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was
over-withdrawn. Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage
over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the
weekend. If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the
storage over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please
tell me what you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is
still feeling generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try
to cause unnecessary pain.

deals
209176 and 209178.  All the other deals do not have any pricing.  I would 
like to know the economic impact of taking the prices out before Scott see

Attached is a modified version of the Daily Changes spreadsheet you've been 
receiving from Doug Kinney.  The new format shows the required volume by date 
and by meter ... same as before ... but now compares that "new" volume to the 
original FOM volume for each day of the month, as opposed to comparing it to 
the previous days requested volume.  Let me know if you have any thoughts / 
comments about this format.

Again, if you don't want on the distribution ... or know of someone I should 
add ... please let me know.

To date, the only changes for September have been behind AGL, and those 
changes are included on the attachment.

Subject: Beginning Hang Gliding

I don't want anyone to feel left out and please let me know if you don't want 
to see emails of this type in the future.  There is a beginning hang gliding 
class this weekend.  The class is offered through Leisure Learning 
Unlimited.  Go to web site http://llu.com/  select Adventure Unlimited, click 
on the line beginning with Gun Safety (that's next by the way).  Then scroll 
down, it's in there somewhere.  Or you could just give me a call to find out 
more.

Here is the schedule;
Lecture:  Sat  10am-noon, outdoors Sat 1-4pm and Sun 10am-4pm, March 4th & 
5th.

The lecture is at the LLU office on Richmond close to Kirby, I think.  The 
outdoors session is in Addicks, I'm sure that's outside the loop somewhere.

Cost:  $85.00 for the class and a $6.00 or $12.00 registration fee depending 
on which option you select.

Oh yeah, I may need to borrow a hacksaw if Dan Junek signs up!

ENA is set up as agent for Sithe Energies, USA, INC on CNG Transmission.  I 
believe either Kate or Robin did a deal with Sithe last October.  ENA 
released capacity to Sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and 
nominating agent on this contract.  It was a citygate sale  in New York and 
we wanted to transfer title at the pool.

I received a call from Scott Nelson (212-351-0494) with Sithe this morning.  
He is terminating the agency.

470568  New Power Exchange sell
470582  CPR Storage Sell
470587  CPR Storage Buy

We will be using deal 456379 (purchase from New Power) through March 31st.  
Also, we need to make sure we do not recognize the storage balance in 
Sitara.  Joann has the storage contract number if anyone has questions.

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange


I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.

Dayton Power is away from the office on Friday and Monday for the new year
holiday.  They have requested nominations for the 1st to the 4th by 2:00 
today.

The first day of January is the most critical.  I will have the ability to
adjust any of the days from my home over the weekend on an intraday basis.

I will need to work with Joann and Joni (Tco schedulers) to get the 
nominations
in place.

I'll call you, Chris, after morning trading to devise a game plan for the 1st.

If Joann works here today, I'm going to need to stay close by.

Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG 
Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61.  
The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell 
him.


I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport).

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.

Sorry guys.  I'm still working on the February invoice to CES.  I estimate 
that everyday this invoice does not get out cost Enron about $4,000 a day.  
Feel free to call my boss Scott Neal about the problems you are having.

I changed the formula on the IF-CNRGATH curve in the EastMrkt file.  Before 
the change it was CGT/APPALAC - $.32.  After the change its (CGAS - 
$.30)x(1-.0492).  This widens the spread by about $.24.

Below is a parking problem we have with IROQ.  In this example, we were 
notified 1 month after the effective flow date.  Comments?

Angie has documentation from Iroq that she will leave on your desk.  

Angie, for now, please schedule this as parked as current day activity.

Angie/Chris

Just an FYI update on the Iroquois 06/26 parking issue.  This might be 
redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on 07/26/00 that we 
were cut 364 MMBtu's (from 24,502 to 24,138) @ Canajoharie on the evening 
cycle of 06/26/00 (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), & the cut 
volume was placed into PALS.  As I understand it, the late notification was a 
trickle down, i.e. Beth @ CNG notified Iroquois on 07/26, & Iroquois notified 
us when they found out.  Anyway, the 364 MMBtu's are on the August 
Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn, 
incurring parking charges of $173.77 for the month (364 MMBtu's x 31 days = 
11,284 MMBtu's @ $0.0154 = $173.77).  Per Angie's previous e:mail on this 
item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, & this 
parking charge is related, & so, may be disputable.  Either way, the volume's 
currently not in Unify as parked, & will not show up on the Service 
Verification at present.  

Are there any updates to the status on this item?  Thanks.

Brad-

I got your message this morning, and I'm not ignoring you- I have just been 
extremely busy with bid week activities and cleaning for August.  I think I 
know what you're talking about, and I handed that issue over to Chris Germany 
earlier this month.  I have not followed up with it since then, and that is 
my fault.  The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about 
the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely 
notification by any means.  I think that Chris was looking into this issue 
with Colleen Sulllivan, because of the late notification.  I will badger 
Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week 
after the dust has settled from the 1st.  Thanks for understanding.  -Angie

I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility. The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal 
schedule or were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??






thanks

Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers
behind COH.  Its a similar situation to the one we had in June with C&I
customers taken over from us by Metromedia Energy.  We need to do a separate
deal to cover these volumes like we did in June.
Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.

Hey guys,

I am starting to look a little closer at the sythetic storage and actual 
storage deals being done on the Southeast.

I am capturing the sitara deals and their pricing in order to get a better 
understanding of how sythetic and actual deals are priced differently.

I am also taking a look at how we are pathing this activity in Unify.  In 
order to avoid rework for the schedulers, I have been verifying our pathing 
procedures with Donna Greif (Unify guru) prior to pathing.

As more storage deals are done, I will be sure to distribute any new 
information to you all.

Please feel free to add any helpful hints to my spreadsheets.



Thanks
Trish

Hey guys.  I was in surgery Friday, everything went OK.  I'm only here 1/2 
day today and it's pretty much caos today because the whole gas department 
changed floors over the weekend.  Let me know if there are any issues we need 
to address right away.

Charlie, I would like to talk about the daily pricing if you get a chance.

Thanks.

I received a notice in the mail in connection with Columbia Energy Services 
Corporation's sale of its "Mass Markets" business to The New Power Company.  
The purpose of the notice was to inform us that effective July 31, 2000 
Columbia would be assigning its interest in the January 30, 1998 ISDA Master 
Agreement that it has with ENA to New Power as well as all transactions under 
it.  Please call me if you have any questions about this.  I expect that we 
will receive shortly a formal consent agreement.

I bet everything we did in June, July and August is wrong in Unify as well.  
I wonder if we should go back to June 1st on setting up this contract?

We don't have that much activity on this contract.  Let me know.

I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.  I tried 
the other connection and it works great.  I pulled all the tractor pictures 
off the camera with no problem.  I still have not seen a photo as clear as 
the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.

All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy.

This deal is starting to get confusing.... so here is the whole deal 
effective 3/21 to 3/31.

  gulf / leach/coh 22-3

38011/46 8979/8711/8527
51875/25 3657/3548/3473
60599/7  3159/3065/3000
63895/6  3686/3576/3500
63895/8  0/1917/1876  This piece from TCO pool.

No contracts are currently overrun.

Cindy/Kathy/Jesse - we are pulling 19481 from your p20 pool on contract 
63895, which max's out the contract. Any additional Aristech coh 22-3 sale 
will  have to be from TCO pool.

Kara - we are delivering to coh 22-3 as follows:
38011 = 8527
51875 = 3473
60599 = 3000
63895 = 5376

John - I have 550,154 being pulled from p20 for the month. I hope that ties 
to your number. I cannot pull any additional gas from p20, because this would 
overrun your FTS1 contract. The 1 dkt SIT can be made up from Enron's TCO 
pool. Please verify that this is okay. I'll schedule it for 3/23 gas day.

Thank you everyone for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: CES/Aristech deal

I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st.  
Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed 
the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool 
(deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.

 2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline.  
1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.

Price = $2.77
 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach
 .0250  demand charge 
 ---------
 2.8995 CGAS price.



Please let me know if you have any questions.

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any
commodity costs. Thanks JPP

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial
holiday" for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.


Contract Changes:

7-1: 67693     11558
     67829     5000 (aristech capacity)
Total          16558

     67829     3527 (aristech capacity)

Subject: Transport formula settles

Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the 
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as 
possible.  This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as 
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or 
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but 
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating 
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are 
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could 
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The 
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index 
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue 
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES 
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using 
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport 
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and 
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings 
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16
CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are 
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which 
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other 
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more 
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.  
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads 
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know 
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), 
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work 
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

Colleen,

Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling 
daily:

CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their 
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10

Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one 
day lag.  After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any 
derived curves.
If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks for the info!  Do you know what the key is to make sure the tickets 
show up in Unify on the right desk?  Also how do we assure flash is on right 
desk or is this not going to be an issue if we are using the Service P & l to 
flash?  If we use the Service P & L to flash, will the transport info in 
Unify and the flash amts. be the same and on the same desk?  How this makes 
sense!

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.


Comments/questions?

I just deleted the External demand charge on deal 233091.  I wonder if there 
should be an Internal demand charge for $.09?

Shawna,
I am Isabel and I work in Gas Settlements.  Could you help me out with the 
following?

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could 
you let me know if this correct.  Should Enron be charging demand charges?  
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if 
that is correct.  Please let me know if you are not the correct person to 
send this note too.  
Thank you for your help!

The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from 
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of 
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title 
transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user 
customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool 
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer 
fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU  
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.

Angel,

Steve Gillespie is managing the day to day operations of the VNG asset mgt. 
deal for our logistics group.  Please include him with your queries.  It is 
my understanding that we are agents for all of their contracts and we pay all 
their transport costs.  In turn, we invoice them and they re-imburse us for 
that transport. 

Chris Germany and Scott Goodell in the Transportation Trading Group  are 
responsible for setting these contracts in UNIFY.  All of these contracts in 
question are storage or transportation tied to storage. Chris/Scott please 
set up the 5 valid contracts below in UNIFY as soon as possible....Contract 
37634 is terminated effective 8/31/1999.

If you have any questions please let us know.

Hi Joann and Alvin,

As you know, effective October 1, ENA became agent for Virginia Natural Gas.  
Here in Volume Management, as I try to load beginning balances and actualize 
volumes (so that I can pay VNG's transportation charges) for 10/2000, it

I would appreciate any help you can give me in getting these contracts in 
Unify as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Angel

Hi!  Remember last month changing the rate in sitara so the
discounts could be taken....well, I need it done for 12/99 now.
The total volumes for CNG/Sabine for 12/99 are
7,676,198 and we should be paying $13,298.60 for at rate of .00172794.
Let me know if you need more information, or copies, or whatever.  And
does emailing this work ok, or what would work best to update this every
month?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria.  How are you?

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not be 
at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of the 
afternoon.

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon.? 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both.

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up the 
Enron part.

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and catchup.? 
:) 

Take care.?? ii

On the Tennessee side this deal was handled as a Back to Back and was 
therefore
not 'scheduled' so I really never dealt with the particulars of this deal.  I
will try and dig up whatever info I can find on this issue.

Hi Everybody,

I haven't input my CPA 8 numbers yet, I am still sorting them into market
areas.  I am not sure that my numbers are correct due to production and
wholesale issues.  I am hoping to have a couple of people look over my work,
but so far they have been unavailable when I finally got my numbers together.

I appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience.

Thanks.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

FYI.  Commonwealth Energy is adding a new meter to their existing contract.  
The meter number is 4371201 and is at Hastings.  This meter is gathering 
dry.  This meter was a new meter set and will probably begin flowing at the 
end of October.  It is estimated to produce about 30 dths a day.  Please 
forward this on to anyone that needs to schedule this gas.  I'm not real sure 
who is doing your noms on CNG.

Thanks,
Heidi

Jeff Porter at CES said in a 3/16 email...

 as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
 submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
 the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
 made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
 Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17.  Is it a problem that it 
wasn't March 15?

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

Chris,

What's going on?  I just got back from a much needed spring break -- I spent
a few days in Cancun -- what a place!  Nashville's been treating me pretty
well.  I've been seeing this one girl up here for a while.  She's really
nice, but I'm sure that it's only going to be a short-term thing.  How about
you?  Are you still seeing Ingrid?

Have you been going out much with Jim and Merideth?  Well, hopefully you're
still keeping up with the singles scene, because I'm going to be spending
the summer in Houston, and I'll need a drinking partner -- preferrably
somebody who's as much of a light-weight as I am.

Let me know how everything is going.  I should start work the 21st of May,
and I'll give you a call when I get into town.

Talk to you later,

Chad

Why Exercise???

1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day
 when she was 60.
 She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she
 is.

 2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so
 that I could hear
 heavy breathing again.

 3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400
 bucks. Haven't
 lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.

 4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain
 figures out what
 I'm doing.

 5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch
 our toes, he
 would have put them further up our body.

 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken
 by people who
 annoy me.

 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach
 covers them.

 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you
 die healthier.

 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing,
 start with a small
 country.

 10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of
 my glass.

Also, there is 5000/day of Leach to BG&E space at max rate for a term of 
11/1/99 - 4/30/01.  Is this considered retail or wholesale?
I don't see any matching CGLG space to go with it.  Is that correct?

Subject: CGAS k#62039  

Contract 62039 was replace with contract 65402.  It's 20,000 day with a 
primary receipt of Maumee and a primary delivery of COH.  The term is 11/1/99 
- 10/31/2000.  Should I bill the retail group for this contract or does this 
belong to wholesale??  Also, I'm showing a demand charge of $.15.

Please read the attached responses from CES, then we need to get together to 
discuss the value (or lack thereof) of getting this contract.  I have sent 
CES our address to get the Duke contract sent to us so we can consider that 
in the value equation.  Any question, please advise.

Subject: GELP questions



I have a couple of questions about the GELP contract.  First, in the 
agreement's
Attachment A, there are several fuel contracts agreements listed that GELP has
(or had) in place with various counterparties.  I'm wondering what the status 
of
these agreements is--have they expired, are they still in place, etc.  These
agreements are:
Purchase Agreements:
     Union Pacific Fuels--I understand that this is the Duke contract that
currently supplies GELP--Can we get a copy of this agreement?
     Tejas Power Corporation--Expired ???
     Columbia Energy Services Corporation dated 1/15/96 - Expired ???
Storage Agreements
     Columbia Gas Transmission SIT #41825 - Status ??
Transportation Agreements
     CGT-IT agreement #41828 - I'm assuming this is the agreement used to get
gas to GELP--is Duke or CES agent on this?
     Commonwealth Gas Services - same question as CGT IT agreement
          Note:  According to the billing calculations, it appears that the 
Duke
supply arrangement must have some
               FT transport--whose name is that in?
Other Contracts
     Transco - to be acquired - Is there an IT agreement on Transco that is
used?  If so, we need contract # and is someone agent on the transport?

Also, in the GELP agreement you indicated that you get real time meter
information from a Bristol RTU.  How will ENA get this meter information?

Also, just in general--could you explain your perspective on the value
proposition in this agreement?  I understand that there is a $5000 fee you
receive each month that accompanies alot of reporting responsibilities.  Since
the data you provided for last year showed very little gas deliveries in the
"winter period" (where you would receive $.05/MMBtu additional compensation),
there doesn't seem to be much up side value there.   Are there other values 
you
see to this deal that we may be missing?

Thanks for your assistance.

No.  The last demand charge for 270 was on the August invoice.

Are we still getting a demand charge bill from Equitrans for contract 270?  I 
am still estimating about $5,000 per month.

Jeff (CES) and I just had a nice chat about the Choice program. Jeff 
mentioned the "famous contracts" that should be used for Choice Peaking 
outside the SST. I double checked with Joann and these contracts are being 
used for CES Endusers (C&I customers) as follows:

37956 600 CES EU
61822 4000 CES EU
61825 8000 CES EU
61838 1000 CES EU
61990 2000 CES EU
65402 13400 CES EU (contract total is 20,000)
65418 500 CES STOI
66931 4000 Jeff this is Enron's transport. The Paulding contract went away 
effective 4/1/2000.
67693 1200 CES EU
 Rest  CHOICE
38021 19041 CES EU (note... we are using Dayton, because not enough capacity 
for CES EU)
38021 27,000 STOI


If you want us to use these contracts for Choice, we would have to cut the 
CES EU volumes to 0. This would impact about 40 nominations on TCO side. You 
would have to ask Kara/Heidi/Kim/Donna... how many nom's on their side. 
Because of the labor involved and the general consensus not to cut CES EU 
markets, we have always left these nom's alone. We have found other capacity 
for Choice gas above the SST capacity (54,000 now and 134,000 in the winter). 
There are many different options... and we can discuss them over a conference 
call.

The other item to consider, the Choice program requires us to have some STOW 
to use to balance Choice burns. Currently, I have been doing 50/50 to 60/40 
split (pool/stow). The baseload target is 20,000. Actual STOW for April has 
been 2400 to 42,000 depending on mother nature. This is up for discussion... 
I used to discuss this with Paul and Noel on daily basis. Now, I'm just doing 
it on my own.

Lastly, our target for net STOI is 36,000 a day. We have been calling for 
overinjections, caused by mother nature and choice actuals. My understanding 
is that CES had a different goal for net STOI... we just need this clarified 
and can move forward for the rest of the month. We have typically tried to 
meet the EOM goal, not necessarily a daily goal because of choice actuals 
cause havoc. Therefore, we can get the net STOI back in line... with the 
remainding days.

Hope this covers it.

CanFibre.  However, National Fuel Gas Distribution (the LDC) will not let any

OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre.

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.


If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 
9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month.

Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts?  Power Gas 
expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

Subject: EOG for July, Peoples

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Hope - approximately 1224 dth per day (this does not include Bayer and Eagle

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4585 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 382 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

Introduction

In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have 
upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we 
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your 
products.

This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days. 
Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade.

Summary of New Features

Multiple Children - A "Child" product can be the "Parent" of another Child 
(multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed 
against a single Parent.

Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and 
hit the "+" or "-" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount 
in Product Properties until you logout.

Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on 
the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your "shift" key.

Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis 
relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: "Basis 
Link - Parent" and now would say "Stand Alone, Parent").


Detailed Feature Descriptions


Multiple Children

The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together 
in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product 
B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C.

Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a 
chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a 
customer attempts a transaction, the database must "lock" each and every 
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The 
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the 
locks. "Vertical" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are 
much slower to process than "Flat" chains (One parent with many children). 
Large vertical chains should be avoided. 

Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the 
same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent 
Product B. At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link 
to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated 
Basis link and a regular Basis Link.


Static Product Bar Prices

The new version of EnronOnline provides for "sticky" Product Bar price and 
volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not 
reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you 
have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or 
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "+" or "-" buttons. 

One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it 
reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if 
the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price 
movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the 
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder 
for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update 
moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering 
an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price 
movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary, 
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure 
rate.

You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field 
for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products 
which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu.


Sorting/Selecting

The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting 
functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type, 
Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple 
sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then 
Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first 
by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in 
alphabetical order).

If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort 
criteria, plus you can select "Sort by Web Order", which allows you to see 
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the 
website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a 
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing).

When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left 
mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while 
making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not 
necessarily adjacent to one another.


Parent Products and F/X Products

One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its 
treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the 
type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of 
the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version 
does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for 
more than one type of link on each parent product.

Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now 
identified with a stylised "fx" in the Product list. This is to enable easy 
identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the 
parent, rather than managed individually.



Assistance

As always, if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality, 
please contact the 24 hour Help Desk (Houston: 713 853 4357, London: +44 (0) 
20 7783 7783, Australia: +61 2 9229 2300).


General Feedback

If you have any comments on the new functionality, or suggestions for further 
functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had 
previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this 
release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard 
to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your 
requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager.

I think this same memo is on the EBB several times.  FYI  


                                                      May 9, 2000 9:40 a.m.

 Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into 
our
gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited 
number 
of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity 
somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: 
For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering 
and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, 
Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion "bubbles" 
affected 
are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 
3218, 
3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and 
3213
for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there 
does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression 
agreements
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
existing
compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications 
it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion 
recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time 
frames.
We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the 
application 
process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once 
granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity
will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for
incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will 
award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the 
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be 
included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
                                Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after
June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. 
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after
Noon on June 12, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of 
your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.

Sincerely, 
H. Dale Rexrode
Director, Producer Services & Business Development

the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept
applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas 
feeding the Barbour County High Pressure System.  The Dominion "bubble"
affected is 4205.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does
exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations.
The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements 
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
pipeline system.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not 
unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed 
gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to 
Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  
The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the 
specific compression agreement.  Dominion recognizes that the installation 
of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that 
consideration with our need to insure that the application process is 
not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, 
the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed 
capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression 
rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, 
Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression. 
Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under 
the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, 
state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address,
if available, should be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
                                Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 12, 
2000
to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  Please realize that
this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 12, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this 
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 
623-8709
or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding 
this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.

Sincerely, 
H. Dale Rexrode
Director, Producer Services & Business Development

The contracts are the transportation agreements on CNR.  Robert sat with 
Chris Germany yesterday and to our knowledge these gathering contracts have 
never been set up in our systems.  

I'll be in meetings until 3:30, so please feel free to talk to Robert Allwein 
down on 30.  Actually, I think it would be a great idea to spend a few 
minutes talking about this to get on the same page before anyone gets too far 
into the process and we discover that rework is being done.

I just meet with Gloria to decipher what the status is on all her E-mails.  
She's identified all the remaining rate changes needed for today's payments, 
the transport contracts needed to be setup, Sitara numbers needed for 
contracts already set up, and the meters needing to be linked to transport 
contracts.  I'm still fuzzy on this whole process and am not sure what Robert 
Allwein's 60 or 70 contracts relate to... are these purchase contracts?   
I'll be up shortly, working with Brenda... let's see if a meeting would be 
good.

Hey Z, would you show Beavy how to request the CNG Fuel waivers for July?  I 
want Beavy to do it for a couple of months so she will be aware of our 
operational flexibility.

Remember, you need to keep track of all of this on your 2000 accomplishments 
for your year end review.

Thanks.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains my notes on selected items on various days.

To ensure everyone is on the same page. TCO schedulers are still using CES 
accounts, because several agency deals' paperwork has not been signed to give 
Enron the rights to nominate the gas. 

That means that CES can still look at TCO scheduling activities. CES did not 
realize they had this access until recently. Noel Bartlo is in Herndon, and 
is teaching this group how to manage its assets. TCO told me that CES is 
still looking at how we are scheduling our gas. 

BOTTOM LINE.... We need everyone's help to get this paperwork signed and 
processed... so we can stop CES's ability to look at Enron's nominations.

Calp is not listed below, since it is a wholesale deal. If we can get Calp 
processed, we can start using Enron's account. I could eliminate CES's 
account access to Enron and Calp. I would still have access to CES's account 
for the other agency nominations until the paperwork signed. The other agency 
nominations are currently low maintenance.

We parked 25,000 dt/day on the 25th-27th (deal 225515) on CNG and we will be 
taking it out during April (deal 225534).  ENA will pay CNG $.02 x 75,000 dt 
= $1,500.00 in April.

Please let me know if you have questions.

I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new 
demand charges.  The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not 
subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424.

Chris,

Still trying to get Ashland straight.  Thanks for the information yesterday.
Enron, Ashland are TCO are all of the same accord, in that all are saying that
the gas came from Enron and not CES.  The problem is that CES has paid Enron
for this same 1022 per day for those three months.  This is what we have
confirmed with TCO as well...that CES did not make these volumes available to
Ashland, either.

We are showing that Enron invoiced and that CES paid $79,125.80 for 31,662 
dths
for these volumes in January, $87,442.34 for 31,682 in February (s/b 29,638 
dth
but we were invoiced and paid for 31,662) and March was $86,491.86 for 31,682
again.  This makes for a total refund due CES of $253,059.99 for these
volumes.  This could be paid along with the storage imbalance sale to Enron 
for
$183,339.00 for a total of these two transactions of $436,398.99.

Thanks for your attention to this.  Call me if you have questions.

Don Kirkendall

AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.

The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following

Sales Price  $5.4850
Transport to Stoi $.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident)
Storge Injection  $.0249
Capacity Demand $.0400

Total Price  $5.7025

We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 
31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to 
hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).

Thanks

I'll assume that Natural Choice deal we discussed a couple of weeks ago is a
no-go.  Columbia Energy Svcs still hasn't executed its contract.

Dick wants to over inject as much as possible for the holiday weekend.  I 
adjusted the deal tickets in Sitara.  We will inject 31,463 on the 1st, and 
31454 on the 2nd-5th.  Our injections drop to 25172 on the 6th.

Damon just told me he had the numbers wrong.  The FSS balance is 797,464 and 
the ISS balance is (797,771).  This is better.  We need to pay back another 
307 on the ISS and we need to do the inventory transfer.  I know you guys 
will make me proud.

I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel.  He said we have 
positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS  contract, and we have a balance of 
(797,163) on our ISS.  It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much.

Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we 
need to take out the 301 dt.  Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handling 
this please?

Don't worry about doing it this weekend, take care of it early next week.

Thanks

You are correct.  The top 3 contracts were released to CES and the bottom one 
is released to ENA.  I will execute all of them and re-release the CES's 
contracts to ENA.

Everything looks fine with one exception.  The contract at the bottom (K#

Oct-2001.  PLEASE CONFIRM THIS .

Call me when you get a chance.  There is some new capacity to execute for 
November.  Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown 
in yellow.  Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.  I 
won't execute these until I hear from you.











The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.  Scott said Jeff 
gave us the OK on this one.

Chris ---

We agreed to a capacity release deal with Tim Landstrom at Indeck Silver 
Springs.  Indeck will release non-recallable capacity to ENA for $0.10/dt.

 Term:  December 1-31, 2000
 Receipt: Hastings Agg
 Delivery: Silver Springs facility (North citygate)
 Rate:  $0.10 demand
 Volume: 9,549 dt delivered (9,772 @ SP)

According to Tim, he's never had problems taking this to any north citygates 
except NIMO East.  But, it is secondary.  Mr. Goodell has volunteered to 
handle the release, but I wanted you to know about it.  We also bought 9,772 
dt at South Point for December.

I'm not sure if you all are aware of this, but we have access to a great 
report put out by AGA that shows details on all the pipeline expansions.  If 
you already know about it, then just ignore this message.  If it's new to 
you, check out this website--it's great info!

Hey Chris,

Sorry about the phone call -- kinda difficult being discreet around here --
you know!

Yes! I'd definitely like to meet anytime this week.  Lunchtime might be
kinda rough for

you and me both, eh?  So,....maybe dinner one or more nights this week??
I'm available

any evening this week.  Just let me know!


I also spoke with Marde @ EES.  She says that "Tom Hermanic" from her group
will

be calling me soon as well.  It appears that they could use a good
Northeast/CNG

scheduler in the Commodity Risk Management group ASAP.  I applied for the
position via

Marde and the Job# as is posted on the Enron company job site (online).
Just reading

over the qualifications and pre-reqs,.....I like the position and feel that
I could contribute

immediately.

 Let's keep in touch, Chris!  Thanks for calling me!

   Sincerely,......Alain

When we spoke today I mentioned I was fine with April Storage as long as there
was nothing drastically wrong on your or my part. After being on vaca for a 
few
days and realizing what went on, it appears we have overnominated for 3-4 days
for deliveries into storage. Let's talk about this as we do not want $5/dth
penalties.

Chris--I apologize for having to revise the numbers I sent a few minutes ago,
but I had made an erroneous assumption about the volume of SONAT storage gas
that we could withdraw in March.  I will put these values into the spreadsheet
that I sent earlier, but this will give you an idea of what the numbers look
like.



As in my prior message, the above values for storage withdrawals assume that 
we
are maximizing the withdrawals from the so-called "Directly Assigned Storage"
that ENA schedules on our behalf.  I believe that notwithstanding the above
storage withdrawal values, we will still have storage inventory left at the 
end
of March since our withdrawals to date have been so low.   Both the Storage
withdrawals shown above and the Flowing gas should flow on Primary firm
capacity since we have been assigned this capacity by AGL.    The above 
numbers
also assume that we will be maximizing our withdrawals of AGL's IBSS
(Incremental Bundled Storage Service) during March.  The IBSS withdrawals are
not  included in the storage withdrawal volumes shown above, since we schedule
the IBSS ourselves at AGL's citygate.   Note also that the total daily volume
on Sonat--Stg WD plus Flowing-- is higher than in my prior transmittal.  The
reason is that I am assuming no peaking inventory withdrawals during March
versus daily withdrawals of approximately  2,800 dth/day in my prior
transmittal.    This translates into a higher gas requirement from Enron.

Again, sorry for the confusion and this should do it.

Transco
Beverly has all the numbers.  Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit 
as Enron North America tomorrow morning and execute the 4 segments listed.  
Beavy has the offer numbers.  We will have (hopefully) 115,000 dt's of pure 
3-3 segmented capacity, all on k#.7537.

Dan, next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next 
Wed.

Tetco
We ran out of credit on ECT.  Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in 
the morning.  Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be 
executed.  AFTER the all offers have been executed, have Meredith check 
screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000.  Kathy, you might be able to do this too.  

Dan, I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity.  Remember, we did 
release 3500 dts of Ela to M2 to IGS.

CNG
We have no fuel waivers from Canajoharie for April.  I just never got around 
to requesting them.  

Scott, Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-8854 and ask for fuel waivers on 
contract 5A2500 from Iroq/Canojaharie (meter 41101) to the following meters
NIMO East 20550, NIMO West 20500, East Ohio 20100, NYSEG 20700, RG&E 20600, 
and Hanley & Bird 21100.  I left her a voicemail to call you.  Ask her if we 
can send in the paperwork next week.  Let Scott Hendrickson, Robin, and Dick 
know what fuel waivers CNG approves.  I have all the CNG contracts on the 
worksheet.

I will be calling in the morining.

email is but send it to him anyway.  Also, when in doubt about the email, 
send it anyway.  EES probably sends the same thing to John, Jim and Heidi.

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 markets until Monday, 12/27.  We will need a
range from 2800 dth to 3600 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for 
these
types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Well, they will probably file a court appeal, but it doesn't look good.


NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
 published : April 19, 2000

               ANR Gets Green Light for Transco Interconnect

      ANR Pipeline last week won a two-year battle at FERC to build a direct 
interconnect to Transcontinental
      Gas Pipe Line's mainline facilities at Evangeline Parish, LA --- near 
the site of an active natural gas sales
      market. 

      On rehearing, the Commission upheld a July 1998 order granting a 
complaint in which ANR accused
      Transco of discriminating against it by denying a request to construct 
minor interconnection facilities that
      would provide its shippers with direct access to gas sales markets on 
Transco's system at Evangeline. 

      Specifically, the Coastal Corp. pipeline has fought to obtain a direct 
connection to Station 50, which is one
      of several compressor stations on Transco's mainline serving as pooling 
points. There, producers and
      marketers sell gas to LDCs and other buyers who hold firm capacity on 
Transco for shipment to
      downstream markets. The gas sale market at Station 50 is said to be a 
"premium one." 

      In order to get their gas to Station 50 now, ANR shippers must deliver 
gas via ANR's existing
      interconnection on Transco's Central Louisiana Lateral at Eunice, LA, 
and then purchase interruptible
      transportation (IT) service on Transco for a distance of about 7.4 
miles. So, in effect, ANR shippers
      currently must pay "stacked rates" for service on ANR's existing 
interconnect and for service on Transco's
      IT feeder to reach Station 50. 

      But the Commission last week found that ANR's request for a direct 
interconnection at Evangeline was
      reasonable under three different analyses. "First, the evidence shows 
that Transco has provided no
      reasonable justification for denying ANR's request, given Transco's 
history of granting such requests made
      by similarly situated parties," the order said [CP98-74]. Six pipelines 
other than ANR currently have direct
      interconnections on Transco's mainline in the Gulf region that were 
established prior to Transco's
      restructuring under Order 636, and none of the shippers pay an IT rate 
in order to get gas to Transco's
      mainline markets, according to the order. 

      Secondly, evidence suggests the denial of an interconnection for ANR 
has led to "specific competitive harm
      to the operations of sales markets on Transco's mainline," the 
Commission said. That's because buyers at
      Station 50 have been barred access to the competitively priced gas 
supplies that ANR's shippers seek to
      offer, FERC noted. Lastly, it said the establishment of the Evangeline 
interconnect for ANR was required
      under the new five-step interconnection policy for gas pipelines, which 
FERC unveiled last week. 

      In upholding the July 1998 decision, the Commission overturned an 
administrative law judge's (ALJ) initial
      findings that competition hadn't been adversely harmed at Station 50, 
and that FERC's prior approval of the
      IT feeder system provided "appropriate support" for Transco to deny ANR 
the Evangeline interconnect. 

      "We are persuaded by the record in this case that ANR cannot offer a 
pipeline transportation service
      reasonably competitive with those provided by Transco and other 
interstate pipelines, without the
      Evangeline interconnect, a minor facility consisting of valve access to 
Transco's mainline," the order
      concluded. 

      The Commission also rejected Transco's claim that it partly denied 
ANR's request for the Evangeline
      interconnect because it would have led to a revenue loss on its IT 
Feeder system. As the FERC staff noted,
      "six other interstate pipelines currently use mainline interconnects 
[on Transco].....but no evidence indicates
      the extent of even arguably identifiable business loss from these 
pipeline competitors," the order noted. If
      anything, "Transco has accorded itself an anti-competitive 
preference.....to assure that its own IT service is
      used in lieu of the potential alternative proposed by ANR."

The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.  We are using ENA transport and 
the

Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers
behind COH.  Its a similar situation to the one we had in June with C&I
customers taken over from us by Metromedia Energy.  We need to do a separate
deal to cover these volumes like we did in June.

FYI-

Thanks to the help of Terry Franklin and Dominion Transmission, all our CES 
and CEM appalachian pools will now be combined into ENA pools beginning June 
1.  Hopefully this should help to alleviate some confusion and hassle for 
everyone.   -AZ

I entered deal 454356 in Sitara.  ENA inherited this deal from CES.  This is 
a sale to Nashville Gas Company at CGLF Mainline.   I entered all the pricing 
and volume terms on the comments.

P.S.  Nashville is in the process of assigning this deal to Sempra.

OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES 
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal 
in Sitara with a zero volume.

If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).  
If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production 
or pool gas on CNG?

Chris--Sheet2 of the attached spreadsheet contains projections of our March 
'00
gas needs.   This format was designed by Noel Bartlo, who thought that it 
would
be easier for you and for us to keep track of our day-to-day transactions 
under
our agreement.  (Sheet1 is just a copy of Exhibit 1, I believe.)  The numbers
are final with the following exceptions which we will address with you in the
morning, since some of the issues relate to contract interpretation (ours vs.
yours) as it pertains to storage.   The exceptions are noted below:

*LDCs for whom the scheduler is Novsek.  (I need to verify that she included
volume requirements for Major Accounts being retained by CES thru March.)
*COH choice requirements are total daily requirements.  We need to resolve how
this total will break out between flowing gas and storage withdrawals.
*AGL requirements are not included because we also need to resolve some 
storage
issues there.
*In some cases, I see that the schedulers have shown a total monthly volume
requirement in lieu of a set of daily requirements.   We need to discuss how 
we
want to (have to?) handle these under the contract.

If nothing else, you'll be able to give us your opinion of this spreadsheet
format.

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will
need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

I just  changed the demand charge on the Penn Fuel capacity from 6.53 to 
6.423 (deal 205687).  I changed the price on the Penn Fuel released demand 
from 6.449 to 6.423 (deal 205672).  We were billed 6.423 in January.  That's 
an odd rate when everthing else was 6.50.

Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the 
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as 
possible.  This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as 
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or 
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but 
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating 
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are 
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could 
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The 
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index 
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue 
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES 
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using 
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport 
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and 
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings 
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16
CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are 
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which 
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other 
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more 
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.  
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads 
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know 
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), 
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work 
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

Colleen,

Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling 
daily:

CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their 
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10

Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one 
day lag.  After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any 
derived curves.
If you have any questions please let me know.

The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/23/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled "Comments".   The most 
substantive
change is an approximate 1400 dth/day reduction in our daily delivery to WGL
off TCO.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

Effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to 
Oglethorpe on Transco.

Current Process
ENA sales gas to Oglethorpe at St 85
ENA buys gas from EPMI (deal 318335) at St 85 at Gas Daily
ENA sells gas back to EPMI at Doyle Plant at Gas Daily plus variable cost.

New Process
ENA sells gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 (deal 329314, baseload deal  and deal 
318423, gas daily deal)
ENA does an exchange buy (deal 338732) at St 85.  Curretly, this volume will 
match the sale to Oglethorpe at St 85
ENA does an exchange sell (deal 338735), volume on this deal will be the 
amount on deal 338732 less Z4 to Z4 fuel.

Dick;
New Power has an issue with ENA on the TCO capacity that is released to us 
each month by CPA.  I need to put this in an e-mail in order to get others 
included in the topic.

During the purchase of the CES Retail business, we asked for a summary of all 
capacity from CES.  CES could not produce contracts because ENA, as their 
agent, possessed all pipeline contracts.  CES requested a summary of the 
capacity applicable to Retail.  ENA, in response to the request, produced a 
document representing the receipt and delivery points applicable to the 
pipeline capacity.  The capacity allocated from CPA was clearly represented 
as 100% Leach receipt point.  Corresponding, New Power has established all of 
its curves based on this assumption.  We have now determined, as a result of 
a pipeline cut, that we actually have Broadrun and AGG 6 receipt point 
capacity.  

Not only was the receipt point misrepresented on the summary that was 
ultimately incorporated into the CES Purchase Agreement as a schedule, ENA 
also recently executed new TCO capacity on our behalf from CPA and failed to 
provide any notice to us that the allocations changed on receipt point 
capacity giving us a much greater % of AGG 6 capacity.

This is a difficult situation.   We are significantly hurt from an economic 
standpoint as a result.  The Agg 6 gas is as good as worthless since I can 
not find gas here for winter.  It will probably be stranded.  This means I 
have to find delivered gas for the majority of supply which trades at 
exorbitant price.  I also have to pay premiums for Broadrun capacity.  I need 
to get a reply from you as to what options ENA sees in addressing this 
situation.  As our supply manager, we are looking to you for a economic make 
whole.

Take a look at my worksheet and let me know what you think.  Look at column H 
in the Daily Activity tab, this shows my actual daily and monthly 
injections.  Also, on 9/16/200, we did a storage transfer to NIPSCO for 
500,000 dth.

Our total capacity is 6,050,607 dth.  We have all the tariff rules in the 
Strg Rules tab.

his long day at the hospital.  He's probably still there.

Fred with Equitable said he has 2 deals with CES.

1.  Tennessee - Equitable is selling CES 2,500 day delivered to Zone 4 at 
NYMX + .35.  Equitable has the trigger and this deal goes through March 
2000.  CES is currently receiving this gas at Beldon & Blake.

2.  Tetco - CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April and Equitable is giving 
CES 100,000 dth in January 2000 delivered to Tetco M2.  CES has(or will) pay 
Equitable $.65 for the exchange.  We call this a synthetic storage deal.

Do you know anything about these deals?

Can we talk about what we want to pay for this capacity?  PSEG has released 
at $0.16 and $0.15.  Con Ed has released at $0.14.  Do we want to pay those 
prices?  Con Ed will do prearranged non-biddable with us at $0.15 (maybe 
$0.14).

Thanks,

OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES 
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal 
in Sitara with a zero volume.

If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).  
If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production

Chris - did you ask Kate who helped with the Bug deal.  Even if they are not 
the ones for CES, at least they could be at the meeting and help us iron out 
the issues we will face here.  Please let me know.

Also, a side note:  we received the proxy schedule from Melissa, but I'm 
curious if you all have discussed the ending balance for March.  Out of 
curiousity, are they withdrawing right now?  Are they near their required 
minimums or well below?   We need to verify all of this so that we know what 
we're working with when we start doing storage for our own account and use.

Subject: CES Storage

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like 
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?

Why Exercise???

1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day
 when she was 60.
 She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she
 is.

 2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so
 that I could hear
 heavy breathing again.

 3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400
 bucks. Haven't
 lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.

 4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain
 figures out what
 I'm doing.

 5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch
 our toes, he
 would have put them further up our body.

 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken
 by people who
 annoy me.

 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach
 covers them.

 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you
 die healthier.

 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing,
 start with a small
 country.

 10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of
 my glass.

This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  5/31 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    The  file there are three  worksheets labelled
as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':

Please note that for the month of June '00 CES is purchasing additional 
volumes
of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate deal.  The
volumes shown here are entirely separate from the aforementioned deal.

Jeff, the Dynegy scheduler is Jeff North.  His phone number is 713/507-6474.  
His pager is 713/616-1280.  I have left him a voicemail and just paged him, 
so as soon as I talk with him, I'm going to ask him to call you.  Hopefully 
with you guys talking directly, you can figure out why the gas isn't 
flowing.  Please keep me posted as to what I can do to help.

Jeff, I highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in 
yellow.   I'm still working on the purchases.  I do have 2 significant 
purchase items that I want to include on the manual bill.

AND, I'm still working on the pipeline demand charges.  I call you with that

I believe this works.  I'm entering all sales to New Power at Broad Run on 
deal 498019.  I created a purchase deal 498022 priced at FOM Index price.  We 
should bookout these two deals.  The delivery to the citygate should be on 
the big FOM deal ticket comingled with everything else.

I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??






thanks

Subject: CNG Sabine Hub Services

As per our conversation today, we will set up a new service for contract 
I00059 that will be "Park and Lend".

I talked with Scott Mills regarding the Sitara end; he said two tickets were 
necessary:

 1.  An Exchange ticket with the counterparty "CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE" (when 
done with the pipeline) and
 2.  A Storage Capacity Ticket with the pipeline (CNG Sabine Hub Services) as 
the counterparty.  This is where you
  will set up the rate you have negotiated with the pipeline and the service 
that Molly can path on so as to
  get the correct rate for the service.

I will check with Kirk Lenart to confirm the correct way for Global to set 
this up and I will let you know so you may select it on your deal ticket.

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not 
be at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of 
the afternoon. 

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon. 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both. 

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up 
the Enron part. 

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and 
catchup.? :) 

Take care.?? ii

I have more info on this deal - according to Colleen Sullivan, this is a CES 
Retail fuel management deal.  ENA has the right to use the capacity and does 
all the nominations on the CALP contract.  I still need the counterpart set 
up.  Thanks

Victor,  for January, I have set this up as and exchange deal (deals 149775 & 
149776).  We may need to create 2 delivery exchange deals for constrained and 
unconstrained citygates.

Scott, this is the deal we spoke about this morning.  For January, we will 
treat this as an exchange.  We need to chat about Feb and March.

Cindy & Chris, 
I have sold the Equitrans metered production flowing into our Equitrans pool 
for a one year period to Dominion Field Services beginning November 1, 2000.  
Dominion will take whatever the Equitrans monthly estimate is.  I will do the 
deal sheet and have Terry Franklin input into Sitara.
John

We have WV produced TCo.  To my knowledge we have no Mountaineer.  CES never 
wanted to buy Mountaineer production because of the daily balancing for both 
the production and the end-user side.

Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a 
number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller 
pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde 
said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF 
+$.09 for gas this month.

EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell 
it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde 
is going to check around.

Subject: New CNG Facilities to Replace Tennessee Agreement



CNG TRANSMISSION FILES APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE TO BUILD NEW PIPELINE AND
COMPRESSION FACILITIES AS SUBSTITUTE FOR TENNESSEE'S LOOP SERVICE 
  
01/06/2000 
Foster Natural Gas Report 
7 
(c) Copyright 2000, Foster Associates, Inc. 

On December 29 CNG Transmission Corp. (CP00-64) submitted a certificate 
application to FERC
requesting authorization to construct facilities in Pennsylvania and New York 
in order to substitute its own
transportation capacity for market area service entitlements that CNG 
currently holds on Tennessee Gas
Pipeline Co. pursuant to terms of an expiring contract. CNG's contract with 
Tennessee has a primary term
until 11/1/2000 with a one-year notification requirement to terminate. Acting 
quickly on terms of a
settlement (RP00-15) approved by the Commission on 12/21/99, which capped 
CNG's upstream costs
and freed CNG to build its own facilities to replace capacity currently 
purchased from Tennessee, CNG
proposes to construct approximately 13 miles of 30-inch pipeline (TL474x2), a 
loop of its existing pipeline
in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania; to install approximately 13,250 horsepower 
of additional compression
in three Pennsylvania counties and approximately 7,000 hp of compression at 
Brookman Corners Station,
in Montgomery County, New York; to construct and operate approximately 800 
feet of 30-inch pipeline,
known as the Connector Line (TL-510), between TL-474x2 and lines LN-26 and 
LN-380 in Armstrong
County; and to abandon approximately 12.9 miles of a 12-inch diameter 
pipeline in Armstrong County
known as LN-9 (CNG's existing parallel pipeline, LN-19, purportedly is 
sufficient to maintain existing
services to the markets served by this part of CNG's system). These 
facilities are designed to re-create
south-to-north delivery capacity on the CNG system to substitute for looping 
service that has been
purchased from Tennessee.

In support, CNG claims, first, its proposal results in near-term and 
long-term savings to its existing firm
service customers, without degrading service. Second, by not requiring 
assignees to maintain firm
upstream entitlements to service on the Tennessee system, the project will 
reduce the fixed cost burden for
consumers downstream of CNG's LDC customers. Third, CNG's proposal eases the 
constraint for
deliveries on CNG's system from southern receipt points to northern delivery 
points, across the Valley Gate
Junction located in central Pennsylvania. CNG, thus, will be able to 
eliminate its "standing must-flow"
operational flow order. After placing the proposed facilities in service, CNG 
will modify its tariff to eliminate
the requirement that customers with "North of Valley" receipt points -- 
primarily CNG's interconnection with
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. at Leidy, Pennsylvania -- can be 
directed to use their capacity to
tender quantities of gas to CNG throughout the Winter Period. Fourth, the 
proposed construction will
enable CNG to meet its existing market commitments. During the first three 
years after the projected
in-service date of this project, less than 15% of CNG's firm transportation 
capacity will be eligible to expire.
Fifth, to the extent that markets can be served in the future either by CNG's 
own facilities or by the
turned-back capacity that Tennessee accrues in its Zones 3 through 5, the CNG 
construction presents a
competitive alternative. 

Background: CNG's long-haul contract with Tennessee provides for delivery of 
natural gas from the Gulf of
Mexico, plus reliance on an operational loop of CNG's system, operated by 
Tennessee, that allows CNG to
offer more storage and transportation capacity than CNG could provide on its 
own. In the aftermath of
Order No. 636, however, CNG unbundled its storage and transportation services 
and exited the merchant
function. CNG, which no longer required a significant portion of the 
Tennessee capacity from the Gulf to
Tennessee's interconnections with CNG in Tennessee Zone 3, agreed to assign 
its upstream capacity on
Tennessee from the production area to a Zone 3 transfer point (South 
Webster), while retaining the
capacity from South Webster to delivery points interconnecting with CNG in 
Tennessee Zones 4 and 5 to
facilitate dispatching and no-notice service to CNG's customers.

In conjunction with CNG's restructuring settlement, one transaction on the 
Tennessee system thus was
separated into two parts, with CNG and its assignees paying Tennessee 
reservation and usage charges
for the capacity as if Tennessee had a single customer from the Gulf to the 
market area. Tennessee
charged CNG's converting customers the applicable Zone 3 delivery rate for 
transporting gas from Zones 0
and 1 to West Virginia and the South Webster transfer point. CNG, in turn, is 
charged an incremental rate
for transporting gas from South Webster to CNG's delivery points in Zone 4 
and 5, determined by
subtracting the maximum reservation and usage rates applicable to Tennessee's 
Zone 3 (including
applicable surcharges) from the maximum reservation and usage rates 
(including surcharges) for the haul
rate from the Gulf to either Zone 4 or 5. The incremental rate is 
approximately one-third of Tennessee's
maximum tariff rates for Rate Schedule FT-A service from Zones 3 to 5 or 
Zones 4 to 5, respectively.

In negotiations to examine the fate of the expiring contract, Tennessee 
conveyed to CNG that, in order to
preserve revenue neutrality, the assigned upstream contract that feeds the 
CNG/Tennessee market
contract (No. 3919) must match exactly the maximum daily quantity (MDQ) of 
the downstream contract. Any
mismatched quantities will be priced to CNG at Tennessee's maximum tariff 
rates for FT-A service. Unless
CNG were to require all assignees to continue to hold upstream capacity on 
the Tennessee system,
therefore, CNG would no longer qualify for the incremental rate on Tennessee 
on the mismatched capacity
retained by CNG. Meanwhile, as CNG's assignees have elected to turn back 
upstream Tennessee
capacity, CNG's costs would go up unless CNG chooses to turn back an equal 
quantity of service
downstream of South Webster. The cost increase on CNG to its customers, if 
all assignees turned back,
would be approximately $27 million per year.

CNG notified Tennessee on November 1 that it will extend only a portion of 
its current contract for a
one-year period in order to accommodate a new CNG construction schedule. The 
initial termination dates
for CNG's customers' upstream contracts (all assigned from CNG's original 
contract with Tennessee) were
the same. Absent the termination notice, the contract provides for an 
automatic extension for a primary
term of five years.

Proposal to Build Facilities: Given the circumstances, CNG proposes to build 
the facilities needed to serve
its existing market without having to rely on Tennessee for the traditional 
looping service provided under
this contract. Thus, CNG's customers would avoid the anticipated Tennessee 
cost increase that would
result if CNG renewed the contract at Tennessee's maximum rates. Instead, 
CNG's customers will
experience an annual cost decrease as a result when compared to the 
transportation costs approved by
the Commission in CNG's Docket TMOO-1.

CNG proposes to roll the costs of this project into CNG's general system 
transportation rates. Such
treatment, the applicant argued, is supported by the projected cost decrease 
to existing customers as well
as by the system-wide benefits that will result. The benefits outweigh any 
adverse impacts on the affected
interests, as examined pursuant to FERC's policy (PL99-3). No subsidies exist 
under the circumstances,
as the facilities actually will prevent a cost increase to existing 
customers. The proposed construction "also
makes certain cost reductions possible for all of the CNG customers that took 
assignment of upstream firm
services on Tennessee during CNG's restructuring proceeding . . . ." 
Accordingly, CNG has met the
Commission's policy threshold requirement to establish that its project 
satisfies the public convenience
and necessity standard.

Pursuant to the Transportation Cost Recovery Adjustment (TCRA) terms in the 
settlement approved by the
Commission on December 21, CNG will continue to collect its TCRA at agreed 
levels, a specified portion
of which will be attributed to the costs of the project. The annual cost of 
this project to CNG's firm
transportation customers will be $19.8 million, which corresponds to the 
incremental payment that CNG
had been making to Tennessee for Zones 3-4 and 3-5 firm transportation 
services through the TCRA.

CNG related that turnbacks are due to state retail unbundling initiatives 
that reduce the LDCs' need to
maintain pipeline capacity in support of a merchant role. In addition, 
increased liquidity in the commodity
market, largely because of Commission policies supporting market centers, has 
increased opportunities
to purchase gas in the market area. These developments, coupled with the 
potential for significant
fixed-cost savings, motivated CNG's assignees to want to terminate upstream 
capacity contracts.
Therefore, while CNG could have required its assignees to maintain upstream 
Tennessee capacity, the
proposed construction offers a more effective long-term mechanism to enable 
CNG to manage the risk of
future cost increases for its customers.

The applicant said a recognized potential adverse impact on the captive 
customers of Tennessee (who
might face cost shifting) is outweighed by the public benefits of CNG's 
proposal. Moreover, Tennessee
need re-market only a portion of the former CNG market-area capacity in order 
to recoup CNG's
contribution to Tennessee's revenue requirement. Tennessee also has expressed 
confidence in its ability
to secure markets for this newly available capacity.

In order to avoid unnecessary construction, CNG indicated it conducted a 
reverse open season for two
weeks during October, 1999, in which CNG solicited customer interest in 
turning back firm service
entitlements through an announcement on its electronic bulletin board. No 
customer sought to turn back
service entitlements in support of the proposed project. To address potential 
landowner concerns, CNG
plans to construct this pipeline adjacent to an existing natural gas pipeline 
right-of-way, for which CNG
already holds easement agreements. CNG has also directly contacted each 
affected landowner and
secured landowner authorization to conduct both engineering and environmental 
studies on 100% of the
proposed right-of-way.

Cora Pendergrass has been working with Michcon, along with the CES people, to 
try to resolve the penalty issue.  Michcon has advised us that instead of 
assessing CES the $10-$15 penalty they could conceivably charge, they are 
reducing it to $.25.  Just for your info, the penalty could have been as high 
as $585,000; instead, it ends up being about $10,000.

TCO will allow this burn rate until further notice for Hopewell. This 
information has been give to Chuck Barnes at Hopewell Plant and to Cullen 
Harper. 

12 midnight to 10 am = 1200 dkt /hour 10 x 1200  = 12,000
10 am to 12 noon = 2500 dkt/hour 2 x 2500  = 5,000
12 noon to midnight = 3500 dkt/hour 12 x 3500  = 42,000

Total Burn      = 59,000

Note, this is max that hopewell can do... not what they have ordered for each 
day. 

Now we need to find gas and transport to get it there.

Thanks.

If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books 
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES 
- Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to 
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has 
been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized 
after 1/1/00, then it should be entered without the CES prefix (statoil). 
Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with 
the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 
'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use 
the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered 
with the CES prefix.

John, can you fill in the missing details?

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

Here is what I think we have for August

Contract MDQ  Comment
892510  16136  Penn Fuel capacity - Access to M3
892511  7426  Penn Fuel capacity - Access to M3
893145  5000  Access to M3
892875  9496  Access to M3

892872  18705  Access to M2
893741  5000  Access to M2


Now the really bad contract
Offer #17378 from Nat Fuel.  Judy or Scott will need to tell you the contract 
number on this one.  There seems to be a really big difference between 
Ela/Etx and M1.  I think you can physically flow 5000 to 8000 from Access to 
M2.

I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't 
think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this 
deal ticket.

Let me know if there are any problems.

This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month 
scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New 
Power.

Dear Producers and Shippers,

 In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant 
would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many 
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz 
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.  
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen 
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, 
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:

 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 

 2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and
         processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system. 

 We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian 
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.  
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson 
at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.


        Sincerely,


        H. Dale Rexrode
        Director, Producer Services
        and Business Development

Call me when you get a chance.  There is some new capacity to execute for 
November.  Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown 
in yellow.  Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.  I 
won't execute these until I hear from you.











The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.  Scott said Jeff 
gave us the OK on this one.

Hi Scott,

I got your message this morning regarding the releases for the Columbia
customers.  I'll call you as soon as I complete my nominations for the
weekend.

I understand you may be having a problem releasing to EnergyEXPRESS on CNG -
I'll see if I can't resolve that...

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES.  

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
advise.

T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to 
terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question.

ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14.  
The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a 
purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put 
in some of the buy/sale activity.

My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright 
one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days 
we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at 
Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add 
another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy

Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

Hello all:

We will be out of the office June 5 through June 8.  On the mornings of
the 5th and the 8th we will be airborne during the usual IT trading
time.  As such, we would like to sell for Tuesday's gas day on Friday,
June 2 (much like this past Memorial Day Weekend) and for Friday's gas
day on Wednesday, June 7.

Fri June 2 - sell for Sat June 3 through Tues June 6 gas days
Tues June 6 - sell for Wed June 7 gas day
Wed June 7 - sell for Thurs June 8 and Fri June 9 gas day
Fri June 9 - back in the office, sell for Sat June 10 - Mon June 12 gas
days, business as usual

While we are away you can beep us at 860-260-6741.  If you call
203-944-7006 and leave a message, please make it a DETAILED one, because
the voicemail automatically beeps us at the above number, and we call in
to listen to the messages.  Please don't leave a message and then beep
us anyway, you will just be delaying our response to you.  You can also
try us directly at the hotel - 602-955-6600.

Please call either of us at the numbers below if you have any questions.

Robin & Maria

The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/26/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled "Comments".   The only changes
versus Friday's transmittal are to AGL volumes delivered on Transco.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

JoAnn,

Due to the OFO on the BGE system until Friday 01-21-2000, I will need
incremental gas in the amount of 7,000 dth. per day for gas day Wednesday
01-19-2000, Thursday 01-20-2000, and Friday 01-21-2000 a delivered volume of
7,000 dth. each day for a total delivered volume of 21,000 dth.


Kara, if BGE requests call for a reduction for  residential customers  due to
requirements please do not reduce any gas delivered.  We can use this in
addition to the 7,000 dth.also to service our end user customers.   Just let
the gas flow.


Please let me know what K# you will deliver this on.  If you have any 
questions
please give me a call.

Thank You.

Fred

We bought 1800 from CES/Allied Signal (deal 158112) and sold to EES (deal 
158120) for the 29th-31st.  This gas is coming from Allied Signal.  Lee 
Tippet thought the contract number was 62672.

Joany, would you verify that, thanks.

Mary downloaded the purchases and the sales to excel.  I spot checked some of 
the deals and they look good to me.  There are 2 small deals that are 
missing, deals 480324 and 480325.  These deals are related to the CGLF NYMX 
purchase.  I had the buy/sale on CGLF.  I didn't enter the buy/sale on CGAS 
until this afternoon.  Alvin should have these tracked and balance early next 
week.  The dollar impact should be very small.

Remember, I'm out next week.

Chris--the attached file is reflects a change to the version that I sent you a
few  minutes ago.   The only change is a 15000 dth/day increase to the daily
volume in row 364.  Sorry for the confusion.

Chris, I don't believe that this is real. Sounds like a CES system mistake. 
Let

Subject: Equitrans



I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the
end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing shipper 
is
and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

Subject: SST Storage Injection Contract for Choice - PLEASE READ

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

Chris, we are not going to be able to repair this problem in the next few
days.  We need to do some programming work.  If you guys would go ahead and
pay the bill, it'll be washed out in an adjustment hopefully next month.
The bill itself is correct, it's just on the wrong contract.
Let me know if this is ok with you.   Thanks, ii

Paul,

An Amendment to Appendix "C" will need to completed by both the pool that the
meters are being transferred from and the pool that the meters are being
transferred to.  I have discussed this issue with Heidi Boyd at Columbia 
Energy
and I believe she will complete this form on their behalf in order to delete 
the
meters.  You will also need to complete this form in order to add the meters 
to
Clinton's LGA pool once the Pooling Agreement has been completed and the pool
becomes effective.  I will fax the form to Heidi this morning.  It must also 
be
signed by the producer.  Please confirm your fax number (614-760-2794) and I
will be happy to fax the form to you as well.

Carol

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Subject:  Local Production July 00



Hi Karen,

Please nominate a volume of 24,800 dth's for the month of July 00 for CES'
local production.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our
local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the local
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will need
to mention in the letter?

Thanks,

might last until Friday.  Like yesterday, Fred will be determining how much
extra needs to be bought and delivered intraday.  I will work with Enron to 
buy
the gas and get the contract number in order to nom the supply and the 
customer
allocations.  If the customer burns more than 3% over what we have allocated 
to
them, they will be buying gas at the $12.00 Production Rate.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you,
Kara

Elizabeth...  Can you tell us if the terms of the Formosa Plastics/Sport 
Pipeline deals have changed?  The terms USED to be Formosa got the first 
15,000/day (deal 229875), Sport deal #244626 got the next 5,000/day and Sport 
deal #244627 took the swing.  There have been new deals set up in Sitara for 
November production that don't mirror that.  Formosa deal #463959 starts on 
day 4 (what happened to days 1-3?) and gets the first 15,000/day.  Sport deal 
# 456694 covers days 1-3 but the prices are tiered to include what looks like 
Formosa's volume.  Sport deal #463958 covers the rest of the month but the 
prices don't mirror the first 3 day's prices.  Do you see a problem here??!!

Help!!
...Chuck

Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers
behind COH.  Its a similar situation to the one we had in June with C&I
customers taken over from us by Metromedia Energy.  We need to do a separate

Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.

This is just about my intelluctual speed.



  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
  and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
  Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 

  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
  From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say. 

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
  "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth. 

  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
  Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 

  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
  More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

Donnie, I prepared this email a couple weeks ago but was unable to send it 
because of email problems.  It was in my "save as a draft" folder.


ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14.  
The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a 
purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put 
in some of the buy/sale activity.

My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright 
one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days 
we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at 
Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add 
another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy

This was my fault, I mistakenly bought the gas I thought Heidi needed.  I'm
redirecting the gas to BGE.

Hi Joe!!!  I created 2 deal tickets for March they are 243649 and 243650 to 
account for the undertakes on zone SL on Texas Gas.  They are a book out

this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free 
lunch and my New Power golf shirt?

Subject: New Power Set Up on Interstate Pipelines

Are you still willing to provide assistance for establishing New Power to do 
business on the interstate pipelines?  I would welcome the help if the offer 
is still there.  Talk with the appropriate individuals internally and give me 
a call at your convenience. Since ENA is doing all of the nominating upstream 
at the moment, there is not a tremendous sense of urgency.  However, I would 
like to move ahead on this quickly anyway.  

I would see TCO, Transco, Sonat and TETCO as first tier requirement.  CNG, 
NGPL, ANR and Panhandle are probably on the second tier.  

Thanks Chris.

Subject: Questions about CES Capacity

I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to
determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA, with contract
details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am
looking for some of the following; contract #, RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not
sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you
please assist?

1. TCO K#64651-is it CES' or ENA's? delivers to CMD4-25
2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details 
on
this K.
3. TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details.
4. TCO K#65403- believe it delivers 19,000+ to BGE, but need all detail.
5.  CNG NORTH- K#'s 5A2291/5A2181 and 5A2292/5A2182; deliveries to NIMO, CES's
or ENA's?
6.  Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below

7.  TRANSCO Z5-Ex 1 shows 150 capacity, I have no details.
8.  TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA?
9.   Texas Gas Z-4 to DP&L- monthly also?
10. Did CES have any ColGulf capacity that was assigned?

Call me if you have questions.

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked.  You can do what you want, but 
I still think we should book it.  The flexibility in takes is only 10% so 
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't 
book anything.  Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell 
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to.  In addition, per our 
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely 
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or 
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year.  This 
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term.  And finally, what if 
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in 
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you 
want.

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are 
not reflected in the books.  Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to 
book since there is flexibility in the takes.  Also, he said he has a strong 
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it.  Dick 
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now.  So Chris 
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking
contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking 
capability
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system.
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk
Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload 
withdrawal
during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the
contracts which is 2/29/2000.

2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES
retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.  I would work with 
Ed
McMichael's group who should be getting this schedule from CES Retail.

Subject: Storage Questions



I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??






thanks

I talked to John Hodge this morning and here is the scoop.

51407 is the master agreement for CES for Storage withdrawals and injections. 
This master agreement is contract number used for scheduling. This contract 
tracks the withdrawal and injections charges.

Any FSS storage deal that is done will appear on a separate contract number. 
Only the accountants will see this contract number. For billing purposes, it 
will track the demand and capacity charges. This is the case for 63304, which 
is the CES Retail Storage deal. We never use this contract for scheduling. 
Don't think Victor created a separate Sitara deal ticket, so should be okay 
in Sitara.

This concept is similar to Transco, where you have one nominating contract 
for your transport and there are individual contracts for billing purposes.

Hopefully I said this correct... we can ask John Hodge for better 
clarification if needed. His number at enron is X37276.

Thanks.

Chris--see Melissa's note below.....per her note it would appear that part of 
the capacity we valued in the Wholesale book (not Retail) was not really 
capacity they owned.  Can you give me the details on this capacity--what term 
they gave it to us for, rate, receipt and delivery points, volume, etc.  Then 
we need to look at what impact it will have to take it out of the book.  
Thanks for the help.

Colleen,

As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium
Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
how to best proceed with correcting this situation.

Thanks,

With the implementation of SAP, the employee expense report form has been 
modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form
 Wait for it to load
 Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros)

After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a 
new filename.  Do not save as Excel Template (.xlt extension).

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

If you have any questions, contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at 713 
345-7427.

Tco uses a master agreement for the storage's (Contract 51407) and then list
the individual agreements to allocate costs.  Contract 51407 acts as a
balancing agreement to tell you what is available.  There will never be 
charges
on 51497 they will always be on the individual contracts.

I understand that contract 63304 is the retail FSS contract with a total

What

Hi Scott,

I got your message this morning regarding the releases for the Columbia
customers.  I'll call you as soon as I complete my nominations for the
weekend.

I understand you may be having a problem releasing to EnergyEXPRESS on CNG -
I'll see if I can't resolve that...

Thanks,
David Familetto

Scott - I do not see Bridgeline listed on the SE desk spreadsheet for

spreadsheet ?

Sitara # 208196  Bridgeline Storage Company $343,500.00

Additional information on the Transco MarketLink shippers:

Shipper   Phase  Volume  Term  Delivery Pt  Rate

Aquila   I     25,000 Dthd 10 years Manhattan  $0.35
Consolidated Edison I     30,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
ConEdison Energy I     10,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
St. Lawrence Cement I       1,000  10  Camden, NJ  $0.30
Williams Energy I  100,000  10  Manhattan/PSEG $0.35
Virginia Power  II  100,000  10  Trenton-Woodbury $0.30
PPL Energy Plus II     30,000  10  Princeton Junction $0.18

 Phase 1 begins 11/1/01.  Phase II begins 11/1/02.  The rates shown are for 
the demand and are the rates that Transco had been marketing for the 
project.  Each shipper is responsible for fuel and the electric power 
commodity charge and ACA.  There will be no GRI or Great Plains commodity 
surcharges.  The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points are Transco Zone 6 NY 
points.  The Camden, Trenton-Woodbury and Princeton Junction points are 
non-NY.
 Williams reduced their precedent agreement volume from 210,000 Dthd to the 
100,000 Dthd.  Williams' rights to PSEG points are north of the Linden 
allocation point.  Virginia Power is buying a project from Statoil on the 
Trenton-Woodbury line.  Virginia Power's commitment to MarketLink replaces 
one of Statoil's two precedent agreements.  Statoil has also sold another 
project that was underlying their second precedent agreement.  The new and 
unnamed project owner has requested and been granted an extension to the 
90,000 Dthd precedent agreement for a later phase of MarketLink.  Sunset 
Energy Fleet has requested and been granted an extension for their 95,600 
Dthd precedent agreeement.  LFG, a landfill gas developer, has also been 
granted an extension of their 5,000 Dthd precedent agreement to enable LFG to 
finalize a sale with a new owner or to locate an alternative landfill site.  
PPL Energy Plus has the right to deliver into a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL Interstate Energy Company pipeline system in Lower Mt. Bethel 
Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania or a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL's Eden plant in East Drumore Township, Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania on a primary basis.  They also have the right to extend their 
agreement at the $0.18 rate for an additional two five year terms.  Dynegy 
(30,000 Dthd) and Engage (210,000 Dthd) terminated their respective precedent 
agreements.  Due to these terminations and reductions,  Transco only has 
announced precedent agreements of 190,600 Dthd for later phases.  If these 
precedent agreements become contracts, MarketLink would have 486,600 Dthd of 
shipper volume.  Transco has stated that all 700,000 Dthd of MarketLink would 
be built by 11/01/04.

Probably won't get to it until after the 1st is done.  I think it will be 
easy to figure out though.

Chris,

Have you been able to figure out if Enron has billed Ashland for Jan, Feb and
Mar on an old 1022/day Columbia contract?  If so, please let me know so we can
make the appropriate adjustment with the Ashland volumes.

Thanks

Sherry,   Please zero out deal 516286. It's already been actualized.  I 
talked to Chris and he said it should have been killed. It was pathed to 
offset the sale to NEW POWER on 521475.  The sale to 521475 should be coming 
out of our pool.  There is a path out there for you to actualize that has 
been tracked and balanced.  Hopefully that will fix the problem. Let us know 
if you need anything else.THANKS!

521475  20000  8.28  sell to NP for the 6th-31st at the pool - I killed deal 
516286 which was in Sitara as a purchase from NP.

Storage deals require a meter on both the injection side and the withdrawal 
side in order to bridge - even if there is only a demand charge.
A zone is not enough, it must have a meter.  Let me know if that works.

The deal was entered on friday 1/7,  and your right it never bridged over to 
Unify.  I don't understand the location question,
the deal was set up like all other storage tickets.  I'm just trying to get 
the demand to download so VM can draft it.

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

The attached file contains our daily citygate volume requirements for   3/30
and 3/31         .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's
date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.    The AGL volumes in this file are not
up-to-date, so they should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Subject: Re: Meeting  

The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that 
someone much more important may bump us.

This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for 
storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is 
a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the 
same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The 
deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the 
withdrawals.

Which brings up the following issues;
 *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES 
at the storage facility.
  Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for 
storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.

 * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?

 * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will 
bill on the net injections/withdrawals

I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.

Thanks

thanks Joanie.

This morning, Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received 
the payment for the wire transfer.  This is the first I've heard of this.

Mark, would you please verify that the payment went out.  I've copied Joanie 
because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is 
going on.

Also, I have a copy of the March bill.  I will go through it today and give 
Mark a copy.

Thanks.

Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience 
at Enron and what can be done to make it better.  That's why Enron wants to 
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's "Excellence 
Through Communication" employee survey to The Pulse.  This new name more 
accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis helps us 
correct problem areas so we can continue to make Enron a great place to work.

Starting Monday, October 16, you will be asked to provide input into Enron 
and your work environment.  We would like to have 100% participation across 
Enron, because the only way to make things better is to know where we need to 
make improvements.


Will be available:  Monday, October 16 - Friday, Oct. 27
Will be located at: survey.enron.com

There are a few things you should remember about The Pulse:

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.  You can complete your survey 
at your desk via the intranet at survey.enron.com.  If you prefer, special 
computer kiosks will be available in some of our larger offices and group 
computer terminals will be available in smaller field offices.  We want to 
provide you with the most comfortable environment possible, as your 
participation is of vital importance to Enron.
2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best to 
cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action preventative 
processes that will help identify smaller problems before they become major 
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are 
collected in the survey -- your active role will help us identify the best 
solutions.

In last year's survey, employees identified several problem areas regarding 
internal communications and we've already acted on many of your 
recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've accomplished or are 
working on in direct response to your input:

* Educational/informational meetings, like Brown Bag Lunches and Executive 
Floor Meetings
* Flex schedules
* Improved PRC process
* Various employee newsletters, like Enside and eBiz

So take a few minutes to check your pulse and tell us what you think and how 
you feel about your job and about Enron.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Mark

I called Peoples, Karen was out and Deana was swamped so I didn't ask her any 
questions.  I also received one voice mail from the Can Fibre guy and I have 
not heard from him either.

Don't seem like anything is getting done.

I hope you had a good weekend.

There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the 
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of 
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.  
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Thanks

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

Look guys - I suspect these are deal entry problems as opposed to deal 
valuation problems.

Please take a look.   Should I just enter these deals in Sitara for now (just 
for April) and let you know what the new deal numbers are?

I see a deal on our list from CES-Wholesale which includes a deal with CNG 
Field Services with a term of 8/1/99 through 8/1/00 for a monthly volume of 
12,690 MMBtu, at CPA4 at a price of IF TCO Appal + $.12.  So, it appears that 
this deal is ours, not CES-Retail.  Let me know if Brian thinks otherwise.

Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG 
Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61.  
The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell 
him.


I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport).

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.

Chris,

I'm looking for gas delivered to two Tetco M2 interconnects with TCo.

At the minimum, I'm looking for an offer for a flat baseload volume for 
December flow.  My preference is to get an offer for a flat baseload volume 
from December through March.  The points and volumes are:
 Delmont {Volume:  3,712/day}
 Windrifge {Volume:  2,859/day}

Can I get a nymex plus offer?

Thanks.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  7/11 the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Per Chris' memo below, it appears to me the question we need to be asking is 
this:
Was this contract number from CES (columbia gulf k#64502) valued in the 
original deal?  Originally Chris was told that this contract was a volumetric 
FT contract, when in fact it is a 100% demand charge contract.  Since it is a 
deal tied to the Devon production, I don't know how (or if) it was valued by 
us.  Theoretically, we could have taken the difference between the max IT 
rate (which is what we get to deduct from the producers' price) and the 
amount of the demand + variable cost of the FT contract and MTM'd $$$.   Did 
we do this?   If we did, then I believe we have a true up issue with CES.  If 
we did not value anything, then I think we are O.K.   

Please advise.

I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.

CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West 
Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts 
and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric 
demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648

I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the 
worksheet.

"Moths"

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you
naked?" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you."

"Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

"Who the fuck are you?" the man asks

"I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with."

The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

"Those little bastards!"

Do you have a total dollar amount that New Power paid for Oct production?  
According to David Scott at New Power, they did not make any adjustments to 
the bill.  He said they may not have received all of the bill, there might 
have been some Michcon activity missing.

Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

To ensure everyone is on the same page.

500,000 over May's MMIQ was already approved and in TCO's gas control records.
200,000 to 300,000 additional was approved on Thursday, May 25, with Steve 
Stonestreet, Julie Watkins, and Brian Adams, verbally on the phone.

Enron should have a total of 800,000 on gas control's books over May's MMIQ. 
Joann needs a total of 822,000 to overinject for the month. Per my 
conversation with Mike Ng, he will ask for the incremental 22,000; for a 
total of 822,000. Mike will let us know if the incremental 22,000 has been 
approved.

Joann also needs the 59,520 for May 31st for a daily overinjection which has 
already been approved by Don Belcher at TCO.

Julie/Steve, please pass this note to Mike.... I don't have his e-mail 
address.

Thank you for your help.

I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this 
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the 
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

I'm glad you like your gifts.  I got tired of waiting on my assistant so I 
took up sewing (for Hector) and metal working type stuff for your goodies.  
I'm helping Joanie move to Maryland this weekend.  I'm out Friday, Monday, 
and Tuesday.  

AND I've been putting photo's on the web.  I bought a digital camera.  Take a 
look .  Go to ==>  http://www.cartogra.com/home/home.asp
Then go to the box in the bottom right side of the screen where it says "new 
to cartogra?".  Enter my account name "trogg522" in the space beneath and 
click on the arrow.

Later :o)

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not be 
at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of the 
afternoon.

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon.? 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both.

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up the 
Enron part.

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and catchup.? 
:) 

Take care.?? ii

Done, please review the following zones.  They are different from last month's
pricing.

TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change
Tenn Z6
And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline.

I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up 
pricing
to take care of it.

  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
  and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
  Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 

  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
  From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say. 

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
  "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth. 

  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
  Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 

  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
  More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

Subject: CES Daily March Requirements for 3/28 and after


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen 
contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party 
gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.  

I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of 
you is it?

I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this.

No, I'm not buying.   I reviewed my credit card receipts this week and I 
bought
last.  Yawl's turn.

Don has brought me lots of checks, one for $1800 on farm equipment, $3000 from
Gerald for cows, (I think we are suppose to hold this check) and $5900 for
selling the cows.   You want me to hold this till we talk Thursday night.  I
have the checks in my Freezer on ice so they will not be hot.   I can 
continue t
hold or deposit into the account.   Your call Bub.  Also have some on Dad's 
mail
that Don dropped off.

Barb and I will be going up Friday to Alto to check out the place, mow and 
weed
eat etc.   I'll grab the mail and I have Don's check for $10,000 to Mary.   
I'll
probably go by and drop flowers on Dad's grave.

How was your trip?  Did you miss me?   You by a motorcycle YET?   I have not
really looked yet.   Sold the four wheeler to Don for $4000 plus the trailer.
I did not really need it and he asked if I wanted to sell it.

Got the insurance check from Met Life.   I signed it and put my account # on 
it
to deposit after church Sunday morning.  Stuck it and my offering check in my
wallet.  They took up the offering so I pulled out my check and put it in the
offering plate.  When I handed the offering plate to the usher, I noticed
writing on my check, then it hit me, WRONG CHECK.   Barb said my face turned
dark purple and eyes looked like watermelons.    I was stammering, wait wait,
wrong check!   Whooo, that was a close one.   Thought you might enjoy that 
one.

Hey Dow stock is an excellent buy at $24.00.   If we do not buy a scooter 
soon,
I'm going to invest a little in the Dow Stock.

Talk to you this afternoon once you are settled back in.  See Ya

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

I sold the Niagara/Nat Fuel back to the Central Desk for the rest of the 
month.  Please take the 16,500 dt of Trco Z6 to Z6 space to 0 in Sitara for

Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the 
supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.

I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.

Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct?

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and

Stephanie,
Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

I spoke to Rich.? We don't keep records in such a way that would give us the 
temperature at which we restrict Linden.? We determine 
secondary/interruptible space at Linden based on utilization.? Of course 
utilization is ultimately based on temp... but we just don't have an answer

their full contract entitlements?

Chris,

Operational note on DPL Columbia Gas SST contract for April:

The total contract volume will decrease from 241,000 to 120,000 on April 
1st.  By the terms of the deal, Dayton will take what they need on a daily 
basis and Enron will have the remainder of the contract MDQ.

Assuming normal system demand at DPL, Enron should have from 70,000 to 95,000 
of this SST contract during the month of April.

ECONOMIC NOTE:

Enron will not have to pay any variable cost (demand or commodity) to Dayton 
until the cumulative usage of the SST contract by DPL and Enron reaches 
9,239,520 /dth.  Based on the historical data compiled by Columbia during the 
course of the asset management deal, this 9.2 dth figure  will not be hit 
until sometime in June or early July.

It is to our advantage to fill this contract up to the max. allowed by DPL on 
a daily basis until this 9.2 figure comes into play.   It is an immediate 
saving of the commodity charge, which will be about $0.015.

I can provide a copy of the actual contract for your review upon request.

sg

Joan--With respect to CES's TCO storage for the COH choice program, please
schedule 48,000 dth/day to be withdrawn for the last 6 days of Februray.  If
necessary, CES will sell back flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the
storage withdrawal at this level.    If TCO imposes some sort of operational
limits that prevent us from pulling this amount, please pull as much as you 
can
up to this amount without violating the limits or otherwise incurring
penalties.


Thanks and please call me if you have questions, comments, etc.

Here are a couple of real bookout examples for October.

These are deals Brian Perrone did.
New Power purchased gas from ENA for deliveries to WGL.
Deal #377264
The price is NX! + .325 and the volume is 15014/month.

Since New Power is taking all deliveries on CGAS, I buy the TRCO gas back at 

IF CGAS  $5.5500
FOM Prem  $.0075
CGAS Transport $.1468
ENA Oct Demand $.06

Total   $5.7643

The actual volumes for WGL are included in the large sale to New Power on 
CGAS.  The pricing looks strange because ENA is paying New Power a $.06 
demand charge for transport.  Since this is a citygate NYMX deal, I treat it 
the same as if New Power

Depends on how the deals were entered originally.  If the sum of both deals 
will make up the total expense that will be paid to pipeline, then the 
waivers/discounts need to be included on both tickets.  If the tickets have 
been entered by some other method, a review might be necessary.  

Even though we know that we will pay the pipeline based on the net activity 
across all deals, each deal will be treated independently in Unify when 
determining the expense.  If two deals are entered assuming the tariff rate 
applies, then later one deal is modified to a negotiated price, only the 
volumes that are moved on the negotiated price deal will be valued this way, 
the volumes that move on the other ticket will still be valued at tariff rate.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Capacity question

I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel 
waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on 
the secondary capacity deal ticket?

Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing 
from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?

Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00.
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you
yesterday.  Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes), the
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were only
picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the
attached version.

Sorry for any confusion.

I knew we would have to address this eventually.

CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E.  I showed them a $2.66 bid for 
tomorrow.  Before I had worked up the price, CES decided to take the gas into 
CGAS at Lebanon.

This gets real messy.  Is there any way we can refuse this?  At first, I was 
thinking we would have to do this.  Now, I don't like the idea because it 
will be really messy in the summer.

CES has been the billing agent on those contracts since their effective
date.  CES continues to be the billing agent today.  Union Camp will have to
write us a letter to change that.

Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day.  This would 
be
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable 
for
penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.

anyway you can take a stab at what our position is from Nov 00 to Oct 01 by

Surprisingly, 12,485 of our 15,500 dth/d of capacity that TCO had put out
for
bid, has been bid on for between the minimum, $5.171 and $5.1807. CES
currently
has it from 11/99 to 10/00 for $4.56.  We have until 7/6 to tell ENA, as
our
agent, to tell TCO whether we want to match those bids for the next year or
let
it go to the bidders.
Also here is an update on the non theoretical storage.

Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed 
the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool 
(deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.

 2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline.  
1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.

Price = $2.77
 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach
 .0250  demand charge 
 ---------
 2.8995 CGAS price.



Please let me know if you have any questions.

about an hour?  

Thanks.

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

After talking to Victor, he said this was the correct process. I'm thinking 
Joann  can update the CES and Calp tickets in the morning when she runs the 
new navigator reports. Joann can also update Dayton's ticket in the afternoon 
from our spreadsheet or Steve's. 

Joann, let me or Robert know if you need some help in updating these tickets.

Thanks.

Subject: Transport Usage Tickets - Daily Updates

Now that TCO has slowed down... want to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Chris helped TCO out in January by updating the Transport Tickets. Chris 
thought we were updating the tickets in February. We thought Chris was 
updating the tickets. Unfortunately.. they were not updated.

Starting with March Forward... please advise if this is the correct process.

Sitara #

95448 = 180,000  This ticket will be used for Enron North America as Shipper??
   Joann can get this number off her daily navigator reports or maybe we can 
modify a navigator report.

165985 = 50,000  This ticket will be used for Dayton as Shipper??
   We have a daily Dayton spreadsheet that we use to schedule from and Steve 
Gillespie also sends out a daily sheet.

165984 = 20,000  This ticket will be used for Calp as Shipper??  
   Joann can get this number off her daily navigator reports or maybe we can 
modify a navigator report.

Let me know if we are thinking this through correctly.

Thanks for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This 250R/245D should be part of our daily demand for COH 8-35from ENA, not 
in addition to. 
ie 750/d demand = 245(AGG POOL) + 505( sto+ IPP)
Also please pull directly from Agg Pool to transport K, ( not through IPP 
Pool ) as it may get cut

Hi Everybody,

I haven't input my CPA 8 numbers yet, I am still sorting them into market
areas.  I am not sure that my numbers are correct due to production and
wholesale issues.  I am hoping to have a couple of people look over my work,
but so far they have been unavailable when I finally got my numbers together.

I appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience.

Thanks.

Karen - All but S. Ct. and Boston Gas are good to nom.   Please let me know
k#'s.   Scott called me earlier and told me we are expecting a capacity piece
of 1000 dth and we bought the remaining delivered.   Whom did we purchase the
delivered from?   (I would like to call the supplier and give them the
breakdown so that I can get a contract number).

Noel - Also as per our earlier conversation, Yankee is giving me until 4:30
p.m. to turn in a contract # for their noms.   They are quoting their tariff 
as
we have never turned our contract number in to them on time.    I need a
contract number for Tennesse and AGT for Yankee.   It is urgent.

Chris, I just figured out why you did not see the e-mail, I did not send it 
to you!!!!
Sorry, here it is.
Guys,
A friend recommended Capacity Center, a service that e-mails information on 
capacity release, daily activity reports and system notices from pipelines on 
a daily basis.  There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, 
time frame and the critical nature of  the notices.  The cost is based on the 
number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months 
the cost would be approximately $3,000.  If you would like to check it out  I 
have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 11/5/00).  Click here 
http://www.capacitycenter.com/  the login name is sboyle@enron.com and 
password is jackd.  Let me know if you would like an overview or see any 
reports I can forward them to you via my e-mail.  Or you can call

Mark, David;
Enron Corp is expecting 590,609.20 ($463,609.20 + $127,000.00) from ECT.  
Scott Neal wants to see what impact, if any, this will have on the East Desk 
P&L.  I'm hoping we didn't show any of this as East Desk revenue.

Summary
Earlier this year, ECT received a credit from Transco in the amount of 
$463,609.20.  This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron 
Louisiana's PVR replacement contract for 9612 and 9701 production months.  
ECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated 
with this contract.  Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to 
corporate.  The net effect to ECT is $0.00.  Enron Corp is also expecting 
$127,000.00.  This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in 1997 that was 
written off on 1998 (see below).  The actual amount for the 1997 adjustment 
is $121,080.16.  

Enron Corp has had a $600,000.00 receivable (from Transcanada) on their books 
since Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada.  Enron Corp and Transcanada 
thought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT.

Chris,

In order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August 
month-end close,  a wire or check made payable to Co.366 needs to be prepared 
by the end of this week.  

Please advise me the amount that needs to be made so that I can prepare a 
manual wire/check this week.  I'll contact Inez Haberl regarding the payee's 
bank information.

Thanks,
Vivien

The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment 
(K#016-21045-306C) was $121,080.16.  This adjustment however was reversed 
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in 
11/97 GL and subsequently written off in 01/98 GL at the time the company was 
sold.  I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it.

I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are 
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system 
($498,824.82).  He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to 
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct.  

Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what 
the amount would be.  Thanks,

Vivien

The 9612 production adjustment received from Transco was a reduction in 
volume of (33,517).  There was a ($2,734.99) Commodity adjustment and a 
($124,582.69) Cash Out adjustment for a total credit from Transco of 
($127,317.68).  ECT took this credit.  This volume adjustment was entered in 
the sales system in 10/97 reducing the sales volume to Enron Louisiana from 
284,890 to 251,373 on K#016-21045-306C.  I don't know what the offsetting 
dollar amount would be for the sales adjustment but someone in Client 
Services should be able to get this info.

Subject: Enron Louisiana Mtg. 8/3

I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday.  Tracy is expecting 
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's 
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed  in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that  the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production 
month adjustment.  What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to 
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)  pass it through to 
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3) 
cut a check to Trans Canada?  Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.  
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.  
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait 
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00?  I believe it depends on 
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Comments, Questions?

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and

Stephanie,
Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system.

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

Beavy??  I think the CES and CEM agencies are set up.  I know I need to set 
up IT contracts in Sitara.  And I think the agencies with other 
counterparties is at the bottom of the pile.

Here is the letter and an attachment that you will need to complete to move 
the CNG meters from the CES' pools to ENA's pools.  There are some 
highlighted notes that I put on the letter that tells you what you need to 
do.    You will probably just want to attach a spreadsheet list of the meters 
that you are moving for each letter.  The list will need to include the 
producer information also.  You will need to do one of these letters for all 
the agg point pools.  I filled out everything for you on the attachment all 
you need to do is make sure you attach the appropriate list of meters.

Please call me if you have any questions.  (614) 718-6340

I think Mike Garred and Dave Scott will be coordinating with you and Scott 
G.  We will probably not get corp guarantees.  So, this is causing our 
finance guys to scramble a little bit.  We will probably be subject to a lot 
of LC's which could get pretty expensive. 

For August, we will operate "as is" on the pipes.  There will be no changes.  
However, ENA's contract with CES will be assigned effective August 1.  So, 
all the supply invoicing should come to New Power in Sept.  I will need to 
coordinate with Kathleen to ensure the ENA has "approved" the assignment.  

Call Mike and Dave directly to continue coordination on the pipelines.  
Thanks for you help.  I will be sure to get you the golf shirt whenever they 
are produced........??  Meanwhile, you've got my IOU

How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??  EES and ENA 
used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do 
this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free

Are you still willing to provide assistance for establishing New Power to do 
business on the interstate pipelines?  I would welcome the help if the offer 
is still there.  Talk with the appropriate individuals internally and give me 
a call at your convenience. Since ENA is doing all of the nominating upstream 
at the moment, there is not a tremendous sense of urgency.  However, I would 
like to move ahead on this quickly anyway.  

I would see TCO, Transco, Sonat and TETCO as first tier requirement.  CNG, 
NGPL, ANR and Panhandle are probably on the second tier.  

Thanks Chris.

OK.  When accounting did their initial draft for June production, we had a 
volume of 1,089,120 on deal ticket 268094.  Today, this same deal ticket has 
a volume of 497,015.  I think this  was loaded back from Unify.  Can we get 
that fixed?

Doug, we billed you incorrectly for June on the CGAS storage.  We should have 
billed you for 1,089,289 but we only entered 497,015 in our system.  We will 
get that fixed.

Scott and Chris--Yesterday, I asked Scott if you guys could provide me with a
summary of the volumes of gas sold to CES during April, May, June, and July 
for
the theoretical storage services under our 12/99 Agreement with ENA.   
Attached
is a file that I prepared showing the theoretical storage injections for the 4
storage services as they appear on ENA's monthly invoices.   I note that the
June injection for the TCO storage appears to be only about half of what we
requested and what appears in our GMS system.  My ultimate objective here is 
to
provide The New Power Company with  definitive estimates of the end-of-July
inventories (including left-over inventory from last winter) as well as the
volumes "injected" in July alone.  I hope the attached file helps.   If we
could get this resolved next week, that would be great.

FYI ....

There were some minor problems with the setup of VNG on Transco, but they 
have all been addressed
and corrected.  

I have been in contact with Judy Hall at Transco and  Ellen Ingmire at 
Williams and have fixed the following
issues:

10/1 VNG short 1712 at Emporia, ENA transport  RESOLUTION:  Transco pulled in 
a retro nom that was in Transit
 from the weekend that I sent from home.  It was overlooked in the confusion 
by Transco.

10/2 No issues

10/3 No issues

10/4  After several attempts to load by Transco, we cut our transport by 1 dt 
in zone 45 to allow room for FS to
 be scheduled.  We were overlapping entitlements.

10/5  All noms resent for ID 2 to correct any entitlement issues from 10/4 
late due to system downtime in Unify and Sitara.

For your information, the breakdown of telescoped capacity is as follows:

Total Capacity:  35,930

 ENA   WILLIAMS
Z1 3400   2708
Z2 5000   3983
Z3 11600   9239

I spoke with Ellen at Williams and she is going to e-mail me each morning 
with the volumes and/or zones she will be 
nominating from in order for us not to overnominate the total entitlements 
per zones.  This should be baseloaded for
the most part and further changes should not occur.

I apologize for the inconvenience any of this may have caused for VNG.  We 
will remain on top of this issue throughout
the remainder of the deal.  I personally will make sure all of the Transco 
issues remain resolved so this will not happen
in the future.

Thanks for your patience during this time of confusion.

Bev Beaty

Hi Joe.  For today the 6th and tomorrow the 7th, I need the volume you are
delivering off TGT K#6057 to go from 1186 dth per day to 386 dth per day.  You
should be able to confirm this with Chris Germany.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 8/1and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

I have revised Exhibit 1 of the retail supply agreement pursuant to our 
meeting
last week. Two changes were made:

 1)  Tennessee Zone 6 premium for 1/2000 was corrected to +.06.
 2) Volume requirements for Choice programs with storage were
reduced in most cases to account for storage gas being withdrawn. These are 
the
final volumes.

Trish looked at these and said that the Boston releases were done at Peak, but
the re-releases were done at Seasonal.  I would call Trish to discuss possibly
terminating and re-doing the re-releases.

Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please
forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.

The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The
demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating
correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective 
June
1.

Please look at the following contracts/deals.

Contract  Deal      Comment
779234         003589         Boston releasing to CES
771157         003668         CES releasing to ENA
771224         003786         ENA releasing to Energy Express

Contract  Deal      Comment
779233         003581         Boston releasing to CES
771156         003666         CES releasing to ENA

Robert, I changed the volumes on the CES buy/sale deals 204462 and 204471.  I 
just entered a volume for the last day of the month.  You don't need to do 
this right away, when you get a chance go into Unify for Feb and show an 
actual volume of 0 for the 25th - 28th and a volume of 991014 for the 28th.  
Then retrack and balance.  

Jeff, I will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you.  You 
should be able to apply the payments to these deals.

     The anticipated capacity for secondary and interupptible receipts and
deliveries on our system for June,  2000 has been posted in E-Script.  Notice
that the amount of receipt capacity at our Oakford (Tetco) and Lysander

Lydsander has been cut to 60,000 Dt.


                               STORAGE INJECTIONS

     Customers are urged to review their current storage injections.  To 
insure
you are able to get your storage accounts full by November 1,  it is important
that you maintain uniform injections throughout the injection season.
     Dominion Transmission

?s Rate Schedule GSS,  GSSII or GSSTE  Section 7.4
provides that if Storage Gas Balance is less than or equal to 50% then the
maximum storage injection is limited to 1/180 of storage capacity.   When
inventory is greater than 50%,  then the maximum injection is limited to 1/214
of storage capacity.  In addition, our Tariff allows that customers may over
inject during the summer months as follows:

                      April thru July                 115%
                          August                      107%
                         Sept. thru Oct.          102%

I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet.  I would like to discuss

I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before.

Subject: Re: EOG for July, Peoples  

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.


If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 
9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month.

Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts?  Power Gas 
expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

Subject: EOG for July, Peoples

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Hi Chris,

I sent a manual invoice to Oglethorpe today for Doyle.  The deal (Jim Homco's

Can you enter a deal in Sitara for the cashout?  Please give me a call at

For Herald Oil & Gas, I will set up the meters on the deal with deducts and 
OOGEEP, and get the actual volumes in.  Unify will calculate the difference. 
We will pay them on actuals from here on out.  I paid them originally because 
Herald was in that stack of producers we "create"an invoice for.

Power Gas and Phillips were paid yesterday (money going out today).  Kathy 
Kelly and Chris Germany set up some buy/sell deals so we could pay them and 
bill CES.  I gave them a list of similar deals for T & F, Questa, Phoenix 
Dominion.  

I got a call from Jim Spear at CNG Field Services for some CPA gas for 
January.  I left him a message to send me the invoice he previously sent to 
CES.  I'll get a deal set up and refer it to Kathy and Chris to finsh their

For Richard Burkland and William S Burkland (both CPA), I have no 
information.  Can you supply any ?

They are still trying to get transport contracts set up for the various pipes 
for "CES" production in order to be able to path and track and balance all of 
these meters we have entered on deals.  I am sending Global Facilities a list 
of meters for initial set up in the system, meters for tax codes to be set, 
and I will be putting the OOGEEP deducts on the deals.  And last but not 
least, I am setting up and assigning statement groups (a list of parties with 
no payment addresses set up is going out to Global Counter Party shortly) so 
I can draft these statements after the volumes are put in.

In between,I am setting up some spreadsheets for CNG, CGAS, and Gatherco 
information we have received to help track payments and information. 

I need some assistance with the pricing for Kenoil , RB Robertson, Cutter 
Oil, and a question on Oxford.  Please give me a call today when you can.

Attached is the updated (as of Wednesday) spreadsheet of CES Appalachian 
Deals.

Thanks  WRP

We have reached the last ratchet at 67,371. In yesterday's meeting with TCO 
pipeline, it was confirmed that we should call gas control direct  
304-357-2606, when we true-up choice and the storage withdrawal exceeds the 
67,371. Because of TCO's new stance of enforcing penalties, please write down 
the date, time, and person you talk to at TCO to allow this. 

I also bumped up 3/17's storage withdrawal to better match the end of month 
target. 

Thanks.

Subject: Choice Storage Withdrawal - March 2000

Currently we are on target for March's total goal of 1,125,300 (36,300 x 31 
days). So far we have 1,132,935 scheduled to be withdrawn. As we get into the 
last week, we will teak the numbers to match as close as we can to the 
1,125,300.

Because TCO is enforcing penalties a lot tougher, I want everyone to be aware 
of the storage withdrawal ratchet levels.

As of 3/14, the maximum storage withdrawal equals 87,582 daily. The current 
storage level remaining is 10.5 %

The next ratchet level is below 10% and will probably hit this on 3/16. The 
maximum storage withdrawal will equal 67,371 daily.

That means the schedulers (Joann, Robert, and myself) need to watch these 
levels when we do Choice and especially on the weekends.

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Willard Kinzer, via his wholly owned LDC Belfry Gas, has 142/day of firm 
transport available on 8/1/2000 for one year, which delivers into TCO.  He 
has released and sold this in the past, as he has his own supply that he uses 
to feed his Belfry Gas market.  (Kinzer is the largest independent producer 
in Kentucky, with about 18,000/day).

His agent, Milton Beattie, would like to know if we want to bid on this small 
piece of firm transport.  He  can be reached at 1-606-679-8812.

Call me or him if interested, and either way, please let me know.

Noel Bartlo would talk to the Fuel Management Reps and work deals to use the 
idle capacity. Listed below is what is currently idle.

Who     Contract # Rec Delivery Cap Idle

Bethlehem    no idle capacity (spot deals using it right now)
Allied Signal    no idle capacity
Alliance Tubular   no idle capacity

Since Enron is not using all of CES contracts, did not look at Columbia Gulf 
(Mainline), 

Fuel Management Reps for CES:
Fred Lombardo  Int Paper/Bethlehem Steel 724-873-1300
John Whited  Aristech Chem   724-873-1300
Lee Tippet  Allied Signal   614-481-1160

Before doing deals, please check with me to ensure this capacity is still 
available.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Mark, I don't think I'm going to show this money on any of my worksheets.  Do 
we need to let anyone else know?

I just entered a deal in Sitara (deal 399824).  This is a sale to Transco at 
St 65, 50,000/day on the 18th - 30th.  I also entered a transport usage deal 
399826 for 50,000/day starting on the 18th.  This deal captures the commodity 
cost to go from our St 65 pool to the SIMS pool.

We have some small annoying park & loan deals on Iroq for July.  The parking 
deal is 323553 and the loan deal is 323558.  When we get cut by an upstream 
or downstream pipeline, Iroq uses the park & loan contract to balance the 
supplies and markets.

FYI.   Long Ridge Farm Energy is adding two new meters to their existing 
contract.  The meters are going to be in the South pool and the information 
is as follows :

Meter #-3576601 Well Name-Bartlett  County-Ritchie  State-WV  Est. Vol.-10 
dth/day
Meter#-3584401  Well Name-Roberts  County-Ritchie  State-WV  Est. Vol.-2

These are big money makers. Ha

If you have any questions, let me know.

Attached is my demand charge worksheet for October.

Jeff, we should probably chat about the pricing.  I'll explain it to you when 
I get back.  On TCO, I averaged everything together and entered a fixed price 
on the big citygate deal.

Tetco held a 637 "settlement" conference last Fiday to discuss their latest 
proposal dated March 8th.  Their new proposal involved the institution of a 
weekly cash-out mechanism along with a daily variance penalty based on 
overall system position.

In brief:
PENALTIES
Stage One--on any day where a shipper's imbalance in greater than 7% in any 
zone, the "daily imbalance charge" would be 2x the maximum PAL rate for the 
entire balance (not just the piece that's over 7%) in each zone.
Stage Two--on any day where either the Market Area or Access Area is out of 
balance by greater than 4%, Tetco would have the discretion to issue a Stage 
Two notice, establishing a tolerance level (which could be 0, subject to 
Tetco's sole discretion) that all shippers would have not less than 12 hours' 
notice with which to comply.  Under Tetco's propsal, any volumes in excess of 
the level stated in the notice would be assessed a "daily imbalnce charge" 
equal to 4x the maximum PAL rate.
In a Stage 2 situation, if your imbalance is in the opposite direction of the 
pipe, no penalty would be charged (but you'd still cash-out)

CASH-OUT
Weekly monetization of cash-out positions based on a Sunday to Saturday week 
(Tetco needs to revise this so that the weeks are managed depending on how 
the calendar falls so that they minimize problems like a 2-day week).
Monetization by Zone in 2 tiers
 0-4% to be cashed-out at the average of each day's mid point price for the 
weekly period
 4%+ ENTIRE IMBALANCE cashed-out at the weekly highest/lowest common price 
for the week 
This is a significant change since under the current tariff, shippers pay a 
staggered fee, such that volumes with in the first tier are charged that 
tier's price, then overflow into the next tier is charged at that tier's 
price, etc.  Now, the entire amount would be assessed the higher price.

NETTING & TRADING
would be limited to the week in which the imbalance was incurred and would be 
limited by zone (contrary to Order 637)
Any netting or trading would not decrease the daily imbalance charge (the 
positions would be frozen each day) but could decrease the cash-out exposure 
(completely contrary to 637 which indicates that netting & trading should be 
a tool used to limit penalties)

Results:
it would be possible, in fact likely, that a shipper would pay both an 
imbalance penalty and a cash-out fee on the same volume (contrary to Order 
637)
under the Zero tolerance Stage Two scenario, Tetco would have complete 
discretion to set the level (not itself a bad thing, they need to be able to 
control their system)--they've indicated that they'd set a 2% floor for 
penalties but that doesn't really solve the problem.
not only would the cash-out mechanism be more difficult to administer, it 
could significantly increase our cash-out liability and subject us to 
penalties that do not exist today.

Dynegy, PGC and Indicated Shippers indicated to Tetco that we don't see any 
progress towards settlement, or even a foundation to go forward on and that 
we're ready at this point to go to the Commission for a decision on their 637 
filing as a whole.  Several of the LDC's stated that they want to continue to 
pursue settlement so we agreed to submit a status report to Staff indicating 
that we'll continue to talk, setting an April 30th deadline.  At that point, 
I expected that Tetco would attempt to establish an aggressive negotiation 
schedule in an effort to make some progress--instead all they did was agree 
to my request to provide a comparison of the different offers and scheduled a 
follow up meeting for April 10th.

Tetco indicated that they don't plan to make another offer and would not 
agree to entertain counter-offers.  At this point, I doubt that we'll make 
any significant progress and believe that this issue will end up being 
litigated, or at least submitted to  the FERC for a decision.  Based strictly 
on the letter of the Order (or at least our interpretation of it), I think we 
have 

Please let me know if you have any questions / concerns / comments.

Thanks,

I understand we have the CES Cove Point  storage contracts set up as CES-Cove 
Point in global.  What is the status of the paperwork and who is following up 
on it.  Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North America 
now has 3 storage contracts.

Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the 
counterparty  instead of Cove Point for the January payment.  
The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the 
counterparty.

Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services 
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's 
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in 
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and 
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the 
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.   

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates 
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make 
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to 
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

   Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)
3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/6/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/7/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go 
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is 
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to 
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the 
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is 
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the 
scheduler would help tremendously.  

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at 
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that 
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On 
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to 
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day 
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required 
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our 
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to 
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be 
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points 
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT 
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other 
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have 
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we 
could.  



Should you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9138.

Congratulations on your purchase of CES Retail.  Chris and I usually handle 
the capacity so we wanted to touch base with you before August business 
begins.
Are you keeping the CES entity for the month of August or switching to TNPC?  
If you don't switch for August, when do you expect the name change to occur?

If you stay under the CES name, business should proceed as usual.  If you 
switch, keep in mind:

For the Columbia Choice programs, the utility is required to release to the 
party responsible for billing Choice customers.  For July- Columbia Maryland, 
Columbia Virginia, and Columbia Ohio released space to CES then I would 
re-release the capacity to ENA for nomination purposes.  This would refund 
the original shipper the demand charges, then ENA would receive the transport 
charges and bill CES direct.  Do you have an entity for Columbia Gulf and 
Columbia Gas for this?  If you do, please submit paperwork for ENA to have 
agency rights.  If not, call Erin Scott at 713-267-4212 to set up your 
business party.

For Atlanta Gas Light, said they will continue to release to ENA, unless told 
otherwise.  Releases begin 7/19 for August allocations.

I will be out of the office 7/13, returning 7/21, so call Chris with any 
questions.
Scott

NEWS FLASH!!!!

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a 
nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not 
based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it 
could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. However, 
finding enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem.

I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.

CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West 
Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts 
and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric 
demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648

I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the 
worksheet.

This deal has been entered a CNG South Citygate deal and it should be entered 
and CNG Appalachian production.  Jim Javins said he thought the deal was 
behind hastings.  Could you guys move it.  I would but Mr. Tengle yelled at 
me about messing up the risk assignments.

Just to verify, this is Gas Daily Columbia App Midpoint for 3/23/2000 -$0.005.
Correct.

Please let me know if you are interested in learning how to run the 
transportation model to assist you in pricing long term transport deals.  The 
model is not difficult to run once you understand what inputs are necessary.  
Also remember once you've learned to use this model that it is not "cut and 
dry"--it is just one of the tools that we have for pricing forward 
transportation.  

For anyone that would like to learn, I will be more than happy to come by 
your desk or, if you do not currently have access to the model, you can come 
by my desk for a demo.  I believe the instruction will work better either one 
on one or in very small groups.

Also, if I have missed someone that you believe would benefit from the 
transportation model instruction, please advise.

Here is what I know.  We started pulling 430 MCF (443 dth) from pool N424PB 
effective 7-1-00 which was changed to 430 dth effective 7-18-00.  I'm 
assuming pool N424PB is the CES/ENA non-priority pool.  Let me know if we 
need to do anything different on our side.

Subject: Re: PNG Local Production July 00  

Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day 
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 
for the month.  

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will 
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. 

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly 
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

This is just FYI-

I think we really need to ask Dan, Judy and Chris to dedicate some time to 
map the market area points accurately.  (What I mean is making sure each 
location has the proper valuation attached to it in Sitara.)  Just so you 
know, when I print out the market area transport p&l, there are 85 
tickets/paths set up, and only 19 of those show a positive p&l.  I know that 
we are not using that much transport that is out of the money--I'm sure this 
is just a case of no one going in and making sure the mappings for each 
location in the market area are accurate.  I would just go ahead and do this, 
but I I do not know the market area points and valuations well enough.  There 
are a few simple things I could point out that need fixing (i.e., TCO pool vs 
TCO citygate--as prices go up and cost of fuel goes up, no one is adjusting 
the curves between the two points, so your transport starts out in the money 
and ends up out of the money; another example is CNR--the gathering charge on 
CNR is now $.44, but we still have our curve set at TCO pool minus $.32.)

Anyway, I know the market area is a bit more difficult because of valuation 
issues, but I have to believe we could do better than 19 out of 85.  (And on 
some pipes, like Tennessee, the ration is 0/33).

I know this is a pain to fix, but one day I do envision that we will have 
automatic notification of capacity being in or out of the money, but that 
will be meaningless if we are not set up to value points properly.

     As of  March 8, 2000,  the Storage Gas Balance for Contract 530586 was
2,944 dekatherms or 21%  full.

     CNG Transmission Corporation

?s (CNGT) Rate Schedule GSS,  Section 8.4
provides that if Storage Gas Balance is less than or equal to 16%, then CNGT?s
obligation to make deliveries from storage shall be reduced by 30%.  
Therefore,
when Storage Gas Balance falls below 16% or 2,236 dekatherms,  CNGT?s 
obligation
to make deliveries from this storage account shall be reduced from 210
dekatherms to 160 dekatherms.

     Please review,  monitor, and if necessary, adjust the storage withdrawals
to avoid overruns and the resulting penalties as provided in Section 35.3B of
the General Terms and Conditions.  If you have any questions, please feel free
to contact me at 304-623-8546.

The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from 
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of 
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title 
transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user 
customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool 
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer 
fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU  
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.

Jeff Porter is the CES person responsible for looking at their transport.  
Last week, he said he was working on their transport numbers.  Also, 
yesterday I informed Jeff about some transport CGAS had listed on the EBB.

acceptable to cancel all CES transport contracts that they did not transfer.
Or any thaty they did transfer as CES is concerned.  Thanks

Just for your information--this may highlight the reason for the difficulty 
for the East Region dividing its transportation usage tickets by contract 
number.  For the entire month of May, the Central region's transport p&l 
report is 20 pages long (and that's after splitting up transport tickets by 
contract number); the West report is 34 pages long; and the East + Market 
East report is 90 pages long without splitting transport tickets by contract 
number.  If the East began breaking up usage tickets by contract number, it 
could result in a five to seven fold increase in tickets.  

Any thoughts ?

Just a note that as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any
commodity costs. Thanks JPP

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial
holiday" for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.


Contract Changes:

7-1: 67693     11558

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

4/1/2000.  These stations were formerly on Columbia Gas Transmission and due 
to certain lines being sold to Gatherco, will now be Gatherco stations.  
Also, these meters will all be subject to the $.25 Gatherco gathering rate.  
This list should include all the meters for Enron North American and Columbia 
Energy Services combined.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Date(s) of Flow

 November 18 - 21, 2000

Contract Involved:

 38088  ENA delivered 33,250 to Hopewell on this contract for dates below.  
VNG needed volume below to balance at gate, attempted to pull    and contract 
was overrun.

  18 VNG took 29,782 from storage, result of both ENA and VNG was 14,002 
overrun.

  19 VNG took 44,476 from storage, result of both ENA and VNG was 28,696 
overrun.

  20 VNG took 37,643 from storage, result of both ENA and VNG was 21,863 
overrun.

  21 VNG took 56,881 from storage, result of both ENA and VNG was 18,876 
overrun
   ______

 Total Overrun: 83,437 @ $0.1992 =  $16,620.65

 60536  ENA delivered 11,451 back into the VNG storage as payback when VNG 
pulled all 14,625 and overran the contract.  

  21 14,306 overrun
   ______

 Total Overrun: 14,306 @ $0.1992 = $2,849.76

 TFE  Total Firm Entitlement Penalty

  18-21 97,743 @ $5.6684 = $554,050.00

   Total Overrun on both contracts and penalty due to market area 
restrictions when overrun occurred.

******************************************************************************
******************************************************************************
****************
1) Enron NA was never notified by TCO of any penalty, overrun on VNG contract 
or pipeline OFO situation during the November 18-21 time period.

2) Denise Dotson was notified by VNG gas control on the morning of November 
20th about the overrun situation above.  The VNG gas control experienced  the 
problem but did not notify Enron or AGL until Monday morning.

3) Enron immediately placed ranking system in Navigator to make VNG first 
priority.  This was completed Monday afternoon November 20th.

4) On Tuesday morning 11/21, Denise Dotson once again called Enron stating 
that the previous night VNG attempted to pull maximum  volumes from   storage 
contracts only to overrun contract due to ENA nominations to other delivery 
points.  Joann Collins called her Columbia team and was told that the  
ranking was not applicable after the last confirmation cycle on any gas day 
with no-notice contracts.  Ranking has zero effect with the late night   
schedulers.

5) Enron dropped the Hopewell nomination from the VNG contract(s) effective 
11/22.

Subject: Columbia Gas Transmission (TCO) penalties - November 2000


** High Priority **

I received a call this afternoon from the VNG - TCO Account Manager.  VNG 
incurred pipeline overrun charges from  Nov 17th - 21st.  TCO stated ENA used 
VNG capacity to deliver to other markets {Hopewell Power Plant}.  TCO 
notified Enron and VNG of the allocation problem during the month of 
November, 2000.  Although TCO assured Enron that the predetermined allocation 
methodology would be corrected to allow VNG rights to pull under the contract 
first, however, based on the conversation with TCO, corrections were not 
made.  Therefore, VNG incurred overrun charges under the VNG contract @ 
$10.00/dth totaling $560,000+.

Please notify pipeline to reconcile and provide AGLES with pipeline invoices 
for November, 2000.  ENA is responsible for all penalties associated with 
this transaction.

August.  Please.

Also, the Egan Hub inventory report for August shows an ending balance of  
(101).  Since the you mentioned that the deal was over, was anything done to 
take the balance to zero in September?

To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had 
a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have 
misstated something, please let us know.

There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum 
withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached 
spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know 
its different volume requirements.

Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum 
Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ)  based on Enron's SCQ. There is no 
Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO.

TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ;

April = 15%
May = 20%
June = 20%
July = 20%
Aug = 20%
Sept = 13%
Oct = 7 %

If you add these months up, the total Injection is 115%. Essentially, 
shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection 
period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is 
5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done).

For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April 
(15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to 
catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the 
ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval 
(I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve 
overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus 
overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full. 


Some other basic rules;

Shippers do not have to fill storage 100% by October.

Shippers cannot have more than  60% in storage by June 1st, unless 
overinjection is approved by TCO.

Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same 
way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the 
MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324. 
Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember 
Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need 
to be used to avoid overrun charges.


Why do we care about all of this....

Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still 
uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for 
Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay 
below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we 
will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for 
overinjections above 36,304.

TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far. 
April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems 
running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run 
the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these 
reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or 
overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a 
volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing  
penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt.

Please save this note for future reference.

According to Morgan at CES, the 5,000 dth purchase from Sempra is off ANR.  
Morgan is in our office today and will be here tomorrow afternoon.  You may 
already know about this deal.  Morgan handles all the nominations at East 
Ohio.

Hunter, someone on the Central desk needs to talk to Morgan about this deal.

Thanks

This is slightly revised.

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4771 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 196 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

Good Afternoon.

Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany.  We have one customer 
at
PSNC.  Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this
customer as their expires.  I just do not want to have a mix up for April and
have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed.  I am in
the process of notifing PSNC.  Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give 
you
the option to inform Chris.

The STOCK MARKET closed sharply higher on Thursday following the
release of today's report on retail sales for April, which was down.
Today's report eased trader fears about rising interest rates
however; it is unlikely that it will cause the Fed. to abandon its
current policy of higher interest rates until there is further
evidence of a slow-down in the US economy. Technically, today's
action appears corrective in nature leaving the door open for
sideways too lower prices on Friday. It will take closes above
trendline resistance crossing near 10,760 to temper the near-term
bearish outlook in the Dow.

JUNE BONDS closed higher on Thursday following today's release of
friendly retail sales data. This week's rebound off the 62%
retracement level of this year's rally crossing at 92-31 has allowed
June to challenging initial trendline resistance crossing near 94-09.
Multiple closes above this resistance level would signal a minor low
might be in place.
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/USM0-daily.html

CRB INDEX surged to new highs for the second day in a row confirming
Wednesday's trading range breakout above 217.88. Sharp gains in
energies supported today's rally in the CRB, which has renewed its
long-term uptrend. I would not be surprised to see the CRB trade
sideways too lower on Friday as it consolidates some of this week's
gains and possibly retest broken resistance at 217.88. However, this
week's move to new highs has opened the door for a possible test of
weekly resistance at 223.23 later this month.
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/NYCE/CRY0-daily.html

CURRENCIES the June Dollar closed higher on Thursday following
Wednesday's late-session turnaround. The setback off last week's low
as the appearance of a potential bull flag. Closes into new highs
would confirm an upside breakout of weekly resistance at 111.37,
which would open the door for a possible test of the 1981 high at
114.88 later this spring. The Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on
Thursday with the D-mark gapping down and closing below long-term
support at .4624. Closes below last week's lows in both markets are
needed to renew this spring's declines. The June Japanese Yen posted
a key reversal up after session lows fell short of the Feb. low at
.9125. Additional gains on Friday would confirm today's reversal
pattern however; June needs to close above .9394 to confirm a
short-term bottom has likely been posted.

PRECIOUS METALS closed mixed on Thursday. June gold posted a new low
close for the week and in doing so turned a number of short-term
momentum indicators bearish. Follow-through weakness on Friday could
set the stage for a possible test of May's low at 273.60 in the near
future. July silver closed lower following Wednesday's inside day
increasing the odds July will try and test this spring's double
bottom at 4.975. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for
sideways trading on Friday. July copper closed slightly higher on
Thursday after probing last week's gap. Momentum indicators are
overbought and turning bearish warning bulls, time is running out and
downside risk is increasing. Closes below gap support at 82.40 would
confirm a short-term top has been posted.

http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/COMEX/SIN0-daily.html
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/COMEX/GCM0-daily.html

GRAINS closed higher on fund buying and NOAA weather forecast. July
corn posted an inside day with a fractionally higher close as traders
digested Wednesday's bullish long-range weather forecast from NOAA.
Light consolidation ahead of Friday's supply/demand report also
limited today's gains. NOAA is still calling for a potential drought
this summer, as LaNina is likely to persist through August. A steady
too higher close on Friday sets the stage a possible resumption of
last week's rally next week if hot/dry weather returns to the
Midwest. July wheat gapped up and closed sharply higher for the
second day in a row due to strong fund related buying. Expectations
for a friendly supply/demand report on Friday and bullish weather
forecast have been the driving factors behind this week's rally.
Today's close above minor resistance at 2.78 1/2 makes March's high
at 2.84 July's next target, then this winter's high at 2.95 1/2. The
rising ADX signals additional short-term gains are possible during
May. http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/CN0-daily.html
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/WN0-daily.html

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed steady to lower due to consolidation ahead of
Friday's supply/demand reports. July beans posted an inside day in
relatively quiet trading ahead of tomorrow's reports. Never the less,
this week's rally is turning a number of short-term momentum
indicators neutral too bullish leaving July poised to renew this
year's rally if the weather turns hot and dry next week. Closes above
5.82 1/2 would confirm the uptrend has resumed. July soybean meal
spiked to new highs before light profit taking tempered today's
meager gain. Today's high-range close leaves July poised to extend
this month's move to new highs if Friday's reports come in neutral to
friendly. July bean oil closed lower on Thursday in narrow trading as
the market remains poised to extend its decline off May's high should
Friday's reports come in neutral to bearish. Today's bearish export
sales report does not bode well for the longer-term outlook in bean
oil. If the decline resumes, the 50% retracement level of this
spring's rally at 17.50 is July's next target.

http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/SMN0-daily.html
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/BON0-daily.html

LIVESTOCK closed lower on Thursday pressured by weaker cash and
product prices. June hogs closed slightly lower but near session
highs as the market attempted to consolidate recent losses amidst a
sharp rebound in bellies. However, lower cash bids and additional
long-liquidation limited to day's rebound as the market is
consolidating above minor support at 71.96. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling further losses are possible later this
month. June cattle closed into new lows for the week confirming
Wednesday's trendline breakout. Today's close below April's low at
68.22 sets the stage for a test of March's low at 67.70 in the near
future. Expectations for rising grain prices and declining boxed beef
prices continues to weigh on prices.

FOOD & FIBER closed mixed on Thursday. July coffee continues to drift
sideways ahead of the May 19 retention plan meeting. July sugar
closed on spec. buying on ideas world surplus should continue to
shrink due to lower production levels in Brazil and other sugar
producing nations. Profit taking ahead of the close tempered today's
gains. July needs to close above 675 to renew this spring's rally.
July cocoa gapped up and closed higher due to fund short covering.
Today's high is challenging this spring's downtrend line crossing
near 830. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to
confirm a bottom and trend change. Momentum indicators are turning
bullish signaling additional gains are possible. I would not be
surprised to see an inside day on Friday as July consolidates some of
today's gains. July cotton posted a potential key reversal down on
Thursday after session highs fell short of testing the 75%
retracement level of this spring's decline at 62.76. Today's
mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday.
Bullish short-term weather forecast for West Texas and the southeast
US will continue to underpin prices. Momentum indicators are bullish
and suggest additional gains are possible.

The ENERGY MARKETS closed higher on Thursday with July heating oil
posting a new contract high today. July crude oil has retraced over
75% of this spring's decline setting the stage for a possible test of
March's high at 30.46 later this spring.

Can you help with this Dayton issue?  This is the one we discussed where 
Dayton is saying there is a fixed price and we have it in the system at 
index.  Can I get a list of all Dayton sales for CES so I can try to match 
them up?

We need to determine if this is another data entry error, or if CES provided 
us with incorrect data, or if Dayton is wrong and this really is an index 
deal.
Thanks for your help.

Subject: CES - Term Sell for Dayton Power Light on TCO - PLEASE READ

This deal haunts us every month. Need someone to verify that CES GMS pricing 
equals Enron's Sitara pricing. 

Just a reminder, the GMS report I used from CES system only had volumes and 
no pricing. I ensured the physical volumes were correct. Commerical still 
needs to verify the pricing on the deals. I don't think this has been done 
yet.

CES DEAL TICKETS
gms ticket # = s-dpl-0070 
term = 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
volume = 5000

gms ticket # = s-dpl-0079
term = 12/1/99 to 5/1/200
volume = 5000



ENA DEAL TICKETS
135702 = 5000.
It appears I changed volume to 0 on 2/29


145321 = 10,000
This ticket has been used for the total 10,000. This may be incorrect. (April 
forward deal # is 227296).

The physical total volume is correct in Sitara, not sure about the pricing.

Thank you for your assistance.

No intra-day changes today ... and no changes for tomorrow 9/22.

I've attached the file to reflect AGL changes over the last couple of days 
while I was out of the office.

POSTED May 23, 2000

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression 
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a 
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make 
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a 
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE 
compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405.   
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental 
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental 
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the 
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it 
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing 
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure 
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights 
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more 
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for 
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should 
be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close 
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value 
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on 
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.

Please terminate the following CNG contracts effective 6/30/2000.  For June, 
we released this capacity to Energy Express.  Boston Gas recalled this 
capacity effective 6/30/2000.  I changed the deal tickets in Sitara.

There are still several issues in the CES retail contract that need to be 
resolved as soon as possible.  In order to be productive in our meetings, I 
am sending each of you a copy of the Retail agreements to review before we 
meet with CES (they will be hand delivered).  Please review them, especially 
the schedules and exhibits, so we can finalize all the issues without having 
to go back and check on a bunch of items.

I have set up the first meeting with CES on Friday, January 7th at 11:00 
am--I will let you know the conference room location later.  Please advise 
ASAP if you cannot attend.  Also please review the following list of issues 
to be resolved and let me know by 10:00 am January 6th if you know of any 
others to be added so that I can send CES an agenda.


Issues to be resolved:

Transportation Contract #65403
Verification of Exhibit 1 data--make sure documentation reflects agreed upon 
pricing methodology
Finalize storage proxy schedules and agree on pricing mechanism for 
theoretical versus physical storage injections & withdrawals
Intraday nomination procedures

Pittsburgh vs. Herndon issues

Retail vs Wholesale questions: Beth Steel, Erestec, Allied Signal, CALP, GELP

Nomination issues
 load estimation-specifically AGL
 nomination change deadlines and associated pricing

Process for data exchanges both first of the month and daily.

Thanks for your prompt response.

Angel,

Steve Gillespie is managing the day to day operations of the VNG asset mgt. 
deal for our logistics group.  Please include him with your queries.  It is 
my understanding that we are agents for all of their contracts and we pay all 
their transport costs.  In turn, we invoice them and they re-imburse us for 
that transport. 

Chris Germany and Scott Goodell in the Transportation Trading Group  are 
responsible for setting these contracts in UNIFY.  All of these contracts in 
question are storage or transportation tied to storage. Chris/Scott please 
set up the 5 valid contracts below in UNIFY as soon as possible....Contract 
37634 is terminated effective 8/31/1999.

If you have any questions please let us know.
Victor

Hi Joann and Alvin,

As you know, effective October 1, ENA became agent for Virginia Natural Gas.  
Here in Volume Management, as I try to load beginning balances and actualize 
volumes (so that I can pay VNG's transportation charges) for 10/2000, it 
appears that the following contracts for VNG/Cgas are not in Unify.

Contract Number  Type    
38079    FSS...Master Contract
35889    x-133 LNG Storage
60536    SST
37634    ISS
53004    FSS
60537    FSS

I would appreciate any help you can give me in getting these contracts in 
Unify as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Angel

Joann,
Apparently the way our contract works, if we have the primary capacity
available I can request gas from you and it will be priced at GDA Columbia
App.  Otherwise we have to price it through Brian/Chris.  Could you please let
me know if we are able to serve these volumes using old CES contracts:

Mkt 5-2  9615 dth total

Mkt 7-1  7600 dth total

Mkt 7-8  321 dth total

Hi guys.  We need to add the CES demand charges to the East Desk P&L.  The 
impact to the desk is ($694,399).  This includes the demand charge paid to 
CALP and the reimbursements for the Penn Fuel capacity.  It does not include 
any demand charges paid to Dayton Power & Light.  How are we accounting for 
that?

The file is under o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls  Use tab 
CES WHOLESALE.  All the demand charges under CES RETAIL are reimbursed.

I sure we are missing some things.  Scott Goodell will be going through this 
worksheet tomorrow.

FYI.  Effective 4/1/2000, ENA will no longer have the Rubin Resources gas at 
Hastings.  He had about 10,000 dths a month at Hastings.  However, we will 
continue to get his gas at Bridgeport, which was only one meter.

Let me know if you have any questions.

This is slightly revised.

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4771 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 196 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

This deal is gas ENA sold to CES for Energy Express.  The daily volume was 
10,322 dth (a total of 309,660 for the month).  The price is CGAS IF + $.0175 
+ Variable + $.02 demand for ENA transport


I just changed the price in Sitara.  My calculation shows a price of $4.6738.

Jeff, I apologize for this if you have sent out the invoice already.  Please 
correct the invoice for this deal and let me know when you send it out.

Thanks.

RE:  Iroquois' 7th Annual Customer Meeting, October 4-6, 2000
(batchmail 09.21.00)

Just a reminder that TODAY, September 21, 2000 is the cut off date for
hotel reservations at the Mystic Hilton for Iroquois' meeting.

If you haven't done so already, you can make your reservations online
at:

**  http://www.hilton.com/hotels/MYSMHHF/index.html

**  with the hotel directly at 860-572-0731

**  or with Hilton Worldwide at 1-800-HILTONS

Use the group code "IGT" to get the Iroquois rate of $135.  After today
we cannot guarantee room or rate availability.

Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about the the lack of rooms on
Wednesday night at the Hilton.  The golf was originally planned for
Friday afternoon but we had to move it to early Thursday morning because
of the holiday weekend, and could not get additional hotel rooms for
Wednesday night because of another conference.  There are still plenty
of rooms left for Thursday night.

If you are coming on Wednesday night, it is suggested that you make a
reservation at one of the alternate hotels in the area and ask to be
waitlisted for available rooms at the Hilton.  The alternate hotels are
listed on our website at
http://www.iroquois.com/igts/mystic/section-mystic-hotel.html  The first
four properties listed and the Residence Inn are less than a mile from
the Hilton.

While you're at it, if you haven't already RSVP'd for the meeting,
please do so by September 28.  You can register online at
http://www.iroquois.com/mystic.html.  If you have already registered
online and did not receive an e-mail acknowledgment from Lori Rauser,
please phone her at 203-944-7022 to confirm receipt.

Please contact me if you have any problems with accommodations, or any
other questions about the meeting.  We look forward to seeing you in
October.

Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

I think we need to make sure we are doing a "point nom".  Acually since we 
don't EDI, we probably don't even need to do a point nom in Unify.

Subject: Re: Allegany contract on CGAS  

A Service Verification is a statement created in the Settlements module of 
Unify.  The Volume Management group uses this statement to approve a payment 
to a pipeline for a transportation related expense.  The Service Verification 
shows an amount calculated on quantities for a contract in Path Manager, 
times a rate from  either the Unify Tables or a rate on the Sitara deal 
ticket.  I could put a zero rate on the Sitara deal ticket to zero the 
unnecessary expense out but this doesn't resolve the issue.  Since we are 
noming agent only, we don't want something coming across the system for 
calculation of a payment.  Is there a different way to handle these types of 
contracts when they are being entered in Path Manager?  I've heard of 
something like a point nom as way to handle.  Are we doing that on this 
contract?

Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany.  We have one customer 
at
PSNC.  Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this
customer as their expires.  I just do not want to have a mix up for April and
have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed.  I am in
the process of notifing PSNC.  Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give 
you
the option to inform Chris.

CES and CEM will still exist for awhile, maybe forever due to legal issues. I 
wouldn't begin canceling anything as the Choice customers are still in CES's 
name and we don't want any capacity returning or other problems. They should 
begin to be transferred to NPC soon. Why don't you hold off for now. Larry 
Friedeman (419/878-4760) is actually the last CES employee and can be reached 
in his Toledo office through 3/31/01.

I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy

last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM 
should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and 
liability) relationships.

Chris--The attached table is an updated version of the one I sent you last
night.   The only thing missing is the AGL numbers which I am finalizing now,
since we understand our latitude with respect to the storage.   I will forward
a complete version of the attached to you with the AGL numbers shortly, but I
wanted to get you the COH Choice numbers, which now reflect the Baseload
storage withdrawals volumes for March.   Also, the attached version contains
the correct numbers for the programs scheduled by K. Novsek.

One other point, the COH choice volumes shown in the rows labelled 'PRIM' are
total requirements less storage withdrawals only.  I have not subtracted the
volumes of March physical hedged previously hedged by Brian Perrone.

Please call if you have questions.

December flow.  My preference is to get an offer for a flat baseload volume 
from December through March.  The points and volumes are:
 Delmont {Volume:  3,712/day}
 Windrifge {Volume:  2,859/day}

Can I get a nymex plus offer?

Thanks.

mhg

FYI.  I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating 
that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For 
volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me 
know if anyone wants a copy of the letter.

Thanks,
HG

Here is what I have so far.   One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi 
Carter.  His number is 713-853-5580.

I learned some things today.  Ishi said Enron hires techies through 2 
companies New Boston Technologies (713-626-4900) and Comsys (713-547-0700).  
Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not 
make them an offer.

Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him.

But, I'm thinking I should at least know your name first.  

Also, we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat 
with.

I get you more scoop later.

Subject: Re: CES/Aristech deal  

This deal is starting to get confusing.... so here is the whole deal 
effective 3/21 to 3/31.

  gulf / leach/coh 22-3

38011/46 8979/8711/8527
51875/25 3657/3548/3473
60599/7  3159/3065/3000
63895/6  3686/3576/3500
63895/8  0/1917/1876  This piece from TCO pool.

No contracts are currently overrun.

Cindy/Kathy/Jesse - we are pulling 19481 from your p20 pool on contract 
63895, which max's out the contract. Any additional Aristech coh 22-3 sale 
will  have to be from TCO pool.

Kara - we are delivering to coh 22-3 as follows:
38011 = 8527
51875 = 3473
60599 = 3000
63895 = 5376

John - I have 550,154 being pulled from p20 for the month. I hope that ties 
to your number. I cannot pull any additional gas from p20, because this would 
overrun your FTS1 contract. The 1 dkt SIT can be made up from Enron's TCO 
pool. Please verify that this is okay. I'll schedule it for 3/23 gas day.

Thank you everyone for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: CES/Aristech deal

I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st.  
Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed 
the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool 
(deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.

 2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline.  
1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.

Price = $2.77
 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach
 .0250  demand charge 
 ---------
 2.8995 CGAS price.



Please let me know if you have any questions.

Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.  Following are 
the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000


Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment
47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes 
below 4,723 per day. 
          Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.

21881  4,599  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below

21882  518  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below


Comments:
If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand 
charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  

Questions for Tennessee;
What are the rates for October?
Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or 
monthly quantities?

Subject: Questions about CES Capacity

I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to
determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA, with contract
details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am
looking for some of the following; contract #, RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not
sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you
please assist?

1. TCO K#64651-is it CES' or ENA's? delivers to CMD4-25
 Originally CES'.  Assigned to ENA.
 19-26 3
 19-27 23
 19-32 4 
 19E (19-25) 34
 Rec-Leach 64

2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details 
on
this K.  
 I don't see a break between Commerical and Retail, can you provide more 
information?

3. TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details.
 Rec MLI 1000 Volume of 2000
 Del MLI 23-9 Volume of 2000
 Thru 12/31/2000
 
4. TCO K#65403- believe it delivers 19,000+ to BGE, but need all detail.
 Rec- Leach
 Del-4-Baltimore 19,293
 Thru 4/30/2001

5.  CNG NORTH- K#'s 5A2291/5A2181 and 5A2292/5A2182; deliveries to NIMO, CES's
or ENA's? 
 5A2292 Enron North America released from CES 5A2289 2/00   476/d
 5A2291 ENA from CEM 5A2288  2/00  422/d
 5A2181 and 5A2182 Appear in the EBB as CES for January.
  ENA was the agent 
 
6.  Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below
 No info provided,  was a file attached to this original email?

7.  TRANSCO Z5-Ex 1 shows 150 capacity, I have no details.
 Sounds like a PSNC type volume.  Can you verify?

8.  TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA?
 YES
9.   Texas Gas Z-4 to DP&L- monthly also? 
 The 1440/d from Dayton on TXGAS is released monthly (to ENA).

10. Did CES have any ColGulf capacity that was assigned?
 All the retail contract, O&R, CMD, COH, etc.  Both FTS-1 and FTS-2.
 Wholesale capacity 

Call me if you have questions.
Jeff 703/561-6447

   It's a Party and You're Invited


   Occasion:  Farewell Party - Joni Veselack
  Day:  Sunday, September 10
  Time:  4:00 p.m.
  Place:  Woods on Augusta (pool area)

 I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one
last get together around the pool!!! So, I decided to fire up the grill and
bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

 Please bring your own "Cheer".

 Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds
out of the gutter.) So, please let me know if you're attending.

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

I took the volumes on deal 472520 (CPR Storage) to 0 and moved them to the 
following deals.  
Crystal, deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF.

Deal  Comment
473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections
473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.

Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.  

Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.  Please set up the Egan 
to Texas Gas ticket.

All of my information is on the following worksheet  
0:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/Egan_strg_NOV2000.xls if any is interested.

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas 
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I 
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR 
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone 
know the deal tickets by the end of the day.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  6/30 and  7/1 
the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Joann,

Here is the distribution of the CES EU deal that Chris did with Charlie last
week.  The original deal volume was
for 263,580 dth/month. Doug could you please ask Chris if he will keep us 
whole
on the contracted price for
the extra 20,000 dth?

Joann pls call me if you have trouble reading this.  Please note that the
volumes to 8-35 are for TIMET only (k64939).

Thanks,
Kara

I will let you know a final time for our follow up meeting regarding position 
reporting on transportation capacity.  As you recall, I wanted each of you to 
pick one pipeline (a difficult one) and let me know how you would go about 
assessing an initial position for that capacity, and how you know on a daily 
basis what has been used and what is remaining.  Hopefully this will assist 
us in translating that information into a formal position reporting system.

If you are not planning to be here on any days next week, please let me know 
that so that I can plan the meeting accordingly.  As always, I will set the 
meeting up sometime between 11:00 am and 1:00 p.m.

Thank you.

This deal is gas ENA sold to CES for Energy Express.  The daily volume was 
10,322 dth (a total of 309,660 for the month).  The price is CGAS IF + $.0175 
+ Variable + $.02 demand for ENA transport


I just changed the price in Sitara.  My calculation shows a price of $4.6738.

Jeff, I apologize for this if you have sent out the invoice already.  Please 
correct the invoice for this deal and let me know when you send it out.

Thanks.

Chris--see Melissa's note below.....per her note it would appear that part of 
the capacity we valued in the Wholesale book (not Retail) was not really 
capacity they owned.  Can you give me the details on this capacity--what term 
they gave it to us for, rate, receipt and delivery points, volume, etc.  Then 
we need to look at what impact it will have to take it out of the book.  
Thanks for the help.

Colleen,

As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium
Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
how to best proceed with correcting this situation.

Thanks,

I created these deal tickets to account for the term sells as follows:

145328  Allied Signal for 3405/day from TCO pool
149785  International Paper (Union Camp) for 7158/day from TCO pool

The counterparty names says CES-Columbia-Retail, because there was no 
CES-Allied Signal nor CES-International Paper. Not sure if this matters for 
Enron's system. Also, the pricing and ending term date needs to be verified.

Thanks.

Is this note to Brian below incremental gas????????

Meaning... Joann has a number about 250,000/day given to her by the LDC 
Schedulers. This includes daily volume:

Who    Volume  Sitara Deal Ticket
CES Endusers    93689  143336
Choice    107489  148416 
South Jersey   36900  142776
Penn Fuel   5000  151759
Hopewell   4500  139679
Texaco    255  136502
Engage   1966  142656
Florida Power and Light  152  151788

Total    249,951

Is there a way to put all incremental gas on one deal ticket??? It would make 
our pathing life a lot easier too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please read the e-mails below.  I don't have any problem handling this the 
way Tim has suggested, but since you've been working on the storage balance 
issues, I thought I'd ask you if there's any reason you can see not to do it 
this way.  Please advise.....

Doug;

I really don't want to go down the road of putting together any more side 
letter agreements.  They are too time consuming.  I really feel that we 
should have no problem forwarding to you our electronic communications with 
ENA confirming the storage volume.  You can use this as a basis to complete 
your billing reconciliations.  I will promise to forward to you all of the 
volume confirmations that we have with ENA for July 31 injections.

Colleen;
I don't have your view.  If you want to do a side letter, as was completed 
for the hedges, let us know.  However, if you all don't feel strongly about 
this, then I am inclined to carry on as I described above.

ESS, and Sonat CSS).   We would also like ENA to agree in some written format
as to the July 31 volumes in each of these storages, where these volumes
reflect the April 1 starting inventory that was left over from last winter.  
If
these final numbers from ENA agree with the values that Jeff Porter put in the
latest version of the storage exhibit to the purchase agreement, that is
fine.   To the extent that ENA has invoiced CES for a different amount(s), CES
will resolve those differences with ENA.  (We know that there are some
differences, as shown in the attached spreadsheet.)

I have asked Chris Germany at ENA to work with us to get this resolved, and he
has agreed to do so.  However, it might help expedite things if you can weigh
in with Chris or with Colleen Sullivan as well.   Please let me know if you
have questions, etc.  I am going to be out of the office for at least the next
few days, but I will be checking my e-mail and voice messages periodically.

Thanks.

Subject: Cut Gas 1/26


I just found out through COH reports that 500 dth delivered to mkt 5-7 via
K38094 (First Energy) did not show up on the 26th of January.

As a result of this and other factors, a total delivery volume to that agg 
pool
went from the 484 dth requested amount to 217 dth.  This was during the OFO
period.  Not sure how we are going to handle the resulting penalties, but just
wanted to make sure that Enron does not pay First Energy for those volumes.
Sorry I was not notified of this cut sooner.

Please let me know if ?s

Kara

Kate left us a bid form for NYSEG capacity.  For CNG, I would prefer to have 
the Cornwell space.  I think the South Webster goes with Tenn Z4.

Dick, other than CES, do you know what our CNG citygate positions are 
starting April?

Subject: New and Exciting National Fuel Deal


We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements (REVISED) for  7/1 
the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or

Subject: TCO STOW Overage - 1/24

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount 
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn. 
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES 
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. 
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. 
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage 
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what 
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling 
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any 
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the 
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES 
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES 
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to 
cause unnecessary pain.

Subject: AGL supply strategy for Remainder of Feb'00



Chris--At this date, CES has a large overhang of storage inventory on AGL.
To address this situation, I have asked David Scott to increase our IBSS
withdrawals to the maximum daily withdrawal quantities for the rest of
February.   Moreover, we also want to maximize our daily withdrawals on the
directly assigned storage services for the rest February.    We don't want gas
injected into storage unless it is necessary to avoid a penalty.   David will
contact Scott about the Directly Assigned storage withdrawals.

To the extent that maximizing our storage withdrawals requires us to cut back
on flowing gas, the cuts in flowing gas will be sold back to ENA  per our
contract.


Please call me if you have questions, etc.

Thanks.

Robin called NYPA.  The transport contract has been amended and the only 2

Unofficially, according to Transco, NYPA has 4 receipt points on their FT-NT 
contract.  Transco gave me the receipt volumes in MCF's and I used a 1.035 
Btu factor.  I can't 

Point  Volume MCF  dts 
Henry  12,336   12,768
Mamou  7,849   8,124
Carthage 4,934   5,107
Ada  7,401   7,660  (at the east end on the north LA lateral leg in TGT Zone 
1) 

   Total  33,659

My numbers must be off a little somewhere because NYPA's MDQ is 30,840 dts, 
grossed up for fuel of 7.62%, the receipt volume is 33,384 dts.  To my 
knowledge, we have never used ADA (which I know nothing about) or Carthage.

Currently we are giving NYPA half their volume at Mamou (off TGT) and half at 
Henry.  At the very least we should be able to switch these volumes around to 
better suit our needs.

Please note, I have not mentioned any of this to Stacey at NYPA.  The only 
information Stacey was able to provide was her delivered MDQ and her grossed 
up receipt volume.  She relies on us to tell her how much gas she is getting 
at each point.

Is the $10,000/month scheduling fee part of the $1,193,725? Is the demand 
charge for all of the reimbursements on all pipelines combined?

I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't 
think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this 
deal ticket.

Let me know if there are any problems.

This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month 
scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New 
Power.

Lilco released the Transco Capacity to CES for June.  We still have not 
executed
the capacity.  The volume is 84 dth (offer #19858) and you don't get billed a
demand charge from the pipeline.  I believe Lilco bills CES directly for
participating in the program.

Do you want to execute this capacity?

thanks

Hi Team.  I just want to make sure everyone gets this message.  Effective 
September 1, we will be using "The New Power Company" in sitara.  All 
existing deals will need to be changed to "The New Power Company" in sitara. 

If you enter deals in the sitara or you find an existing deal with the 
counterparty "Columbia Energy Services", please change the counterparty to 
"The New Power Company".  

Thanks

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers.  The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume 
of
the increase.  That is an estimate.  Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.

As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.  I don't think we should make any changes to 
the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.  However, we will 
need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in 
Sitara.  Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand

I am working with the EOL system development group on improving the reporting 
capabilities of EOL so that Internal EOL traders can personalised and save 
report formats.  Currently the system only saves the last report format.  If 
you have any ideas, thoughts or requests please let me know.
I have attached a file with examples of reports that can be generated.  The 
goal would be to give you the ability to view the information when you need 
it and in the required format.

Attached are my demand charge calculations for the month of September.

I also included the scheduling fee of $10,000.00.  David and I discussed this.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Mr. Westover, there should be no manual billing for the month of September, 
everything should be billed through the system.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   3/31 thru 4/3
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains 
the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

following points are alternate (secondary) delivery points to Transco Leidy 
for contract .3924;

Iroquois @ Canajoharie, Empire @ Lysanda, TGP @ Sabinsville, TETCO @ Leidy, 
TGP @ Morrisville and  TGP @ Ellisburg

I will forward the written confirmation to Steve Gillespie, I should get that 
in the next few days.
The indications from DTI are for the X-56 and Valley Gate restrictions to be 
imposed mid month (November), however if the mild weather in the NE persists 
it may get pushed towards the end of the month.
Let me know if you have any questions.

For January 2000 for a couple of weekends SJersey tried to do intradays.  Due 
to the interconnect and other supply we were not able to change their 
nominations.  South Jersey have always been told that changing nomination on 
the weekend would be on best available.  Julie Punches from Sjersey due to 
her changes on the weekend is over at some of her CDC markets is asking to 
allocate the excess gas to CES agg pools.  
Would this be something Enron would do???

Secondary non-recallable, you can use $.14 year round

OR

$.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter.

The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in.

Chris,

We have been shorted by Beldon & Blake, 6400 dths of production gas so far for
February at National Fuel Gas.  My understanding is that they had a problem
with the pipeline interconnection and could not deliver.  Enron currently 
holds
the contract with Beldon & Blake for the production.  Unless they are under a
force majuere, they should be delivering this gas.  Please let me know whether
or not we will be able to make up this gas for the month.


Per our conversation, we are also receiving local production gas behind NYSEG
and CPA.  On CPA we receive gas from Power Gas, Phillips, CNG Field Services,
and Stat Oil.

Thanks,

Brian

Got an fax from UGI saying that the capacity they release for our customers
will be on Gulf/Tco from May thru Sep. I believe this is a change from TETCO.
Call me if you need a copy of the fax.

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

Attached is the latest file on capacity.  I have updated the C&I list for
releases from O&R on Columbia Gulf and TCO, from BUG on TETCO and from LILCO 
on
Transco.  I have updated the Choice list for releases from Atlanta on CNG,

the
releases that we have made on Columbia Gulf, TCO and TETCO from capacity
associated with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and for the release from
South Jersey on Transco.  All of these changes are highlighted in blue.  The
following releases have not yet taken place for 1/2000, but should happen on
Monday or Tuesday:

C&I

CNG - Release from Hope for sale to Bayer
CNG - NiMo customers
TCO - Release from Eagle Point for sale to COH customers
TETCO - Dayton Power & Light customers
Texas Gas - Dayton Power & Light customers
Transco - PSNC customers
Trunkline - Dayton Power & Light customers


Choice

East Tennessee - Atlanta customers
Midwestern - NIPSCO customers

You are cordially invited to attend one of Transco's three regionally
scheduled 2000 Winter Operations and 1Line meetings.

The meetings are scheduled as follows:

This year's Winter Operations Meetings have been expanded to include a
variety of material that will be of interest to all customers. The meetings
will focus on three specific areas:  (1) the traditional update on
operational plans for the winter, maintenance outages planned for next year
and a customer service update; (2) a 1Line update and discussion on business

practice changes that will require tariff changes; and (3) a review and
discussion of the EDI and flat file datasets for nominations, confirmations
and schedule quantity reports targeted at those customers and their
information technology staff who have expressed an interest in this
information.  Transco will also be holding a pre-filing meeting in
Washington
DC specifically to address the tariff changes associated with implementation

of the 1Line system.  That meeting will be held in mid-November and
customers
will be notified as to time and location in the near future.

The meetings in Newark and Charlotte will start at 9:00 a.m. and end at
approximately 4:00 p.m.  Coffee, juice and pastries will be provided before
the meeting and lunch will be served at approximately 11:30 a.m.  The
Houston
meeting will start at 12:30 p.m. and end at approximately 5:00 p.m.
Refreshments will be provided mid-afternoon.

The agenda for the Newark and Charlotte meetings as well as the Houston
meeting is included below.  Please note that the agenda for the Houston
meeting is significantly different than the other meetings.

Please RSVP to Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054 or via e-mail at
rosina.l.freeman@williams.com no later than Wednesday, October 25, 2000 so
that we can have an accurate count for each meeting.
If you have any questions, please call Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054.  We

I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy 
Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) 
last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM 
should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and 
liability) relationships.

Comments/questions??

As of today's gas day, ENA has a balance of 658,375 dth in CES's storage.  We 
still have 56,000 dth we can over inject for the month of May to reach our 
"approved" max monthly injection amount.

In Sitara, I am showing all 658,375 dth of ENA gas coming out of storage in 
the month of August.

Steve--who will follow up on this to make sure the Retail volumes get 
booked?  Per Scott's e-mail below, he does want them booked for the remaining 
term.

I definatley think we should book these volumes for all of your reasons below 
plus each month we don't seem to have a decent estimate until the 30th or 
31st.

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked.  You can do what you want, but 
I still think we should book it.  The flexibility in takes is only 10% so 
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't 
book anything.  Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell 
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to.  In addition, per our 
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely 
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or 
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year.  This 
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term.  And finally, what if 
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in 
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you 
want.

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are 
not reflected in the books.  Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to 
book since there is flexibility in the takes.  Also, he said he has a strong 
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it.  Dick 
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now.  So Chris 
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

Bay State did paid for the gas in full.  We were invoicing them the demand 
charge on top of the gas cost. They just did not pay the demand. So they do 
not owe us any of the gas cost.   
Should there be demand charge entery on the purchase side?

Hello Chris,
Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed 
about a week ago?(deal # 233091)  Well, the demand charges need to be in the 
purchase side not the sales side.  Per Bay State, Enron should be paying the 
demand charges.  Are they correct???  Bay State is also charging interest for 
late payment.  Please let me know if you need any more information.
Production month Amount
April   $14,850.00
May   $15,345.00
June   $14,850.00
July   $15,345.00
August   $15,345.00
Interest   $926.32

following?

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could 
you let me know if this correct.  Should Enron be charging demand charges?  
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if 
that is correct.  Please let me know if you are not the correct person to

Lilco released the Transco Capacity to CES for June.  We still have not 
executed
the capacity.  The volume is 84 dth (offer #19858) and you don't get billed a
demand charge from the pipeline.  I believe Lilco bills CES directly for
participating in the program.

Do you want to execute this capacity?

This buy/sell ticket with Calp takes forever. I've been pathing for 4 hours 
on just one side of it. It's very hard to keep physical flow versus this 
accounting flow straight. If Enron wants it done this way... may need to hire 
a full time pathing person. Can you tell... how unhappy this makes me.

Also... not sure how Hopewell should be done and SIT. I just pathed the 
amount of 4500 baseload, plus the extra gas that was bought about a week ago. 
Reality... the hopewell ticket should be actualized to burn and SIT is used 
to make up the difference. Not sure how Enron wants this done.

Kathy and Victor... will definately need your help in the bridging process 
and clean-up. Have no clue how this is done and not sure how time consuming 
this will be.

TCO said the contraints will still be in place through the week... so most 
our time will be scheduling gas and dealing with cuts. 

Need help with accounting 
process!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you.

The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for 7/6 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\July00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':

Please note that for the month of July '00 CES is purchasing additional 
volumes
of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate deal.  The
volumes shown here are entirely separate from the aforementioned deal.

Please take these off deal #216184.  There are probably more,

Hey guys,

Just wanted to confirm that that NIMO gas 300 East Meter and actually just 214
to the West Meter was purchased through the EOM.

ALSO

At NYSEG, I need to purchase TCO  300dth/day from 1/27 to 1/31 to send to Mkt
21.  I believe that it is Op 2, Mkt 21, please check with Joann Collins to
double check that Op area, I don't have my chart with me.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks!

Mike, here is the worksheet.  The 2 tabs you need to use are "CES Retail 
East" and "CES Retail Mrkt".  Also, CGAS contract #67693 goes from 54,327 dt 
per day to around 108,000 dth per day starting Oct 1.

We only took 80% of what we could, so we can increase by Market Zone delivery,
or not. We have advised any new buyer of the options and are keeping them
informed if we are forced to make a move, as in the case of the 15,000 of
capacity on TCO. We are being conservative and keeping everyone informed.

How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys
looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this
option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my
guess)?

Yes, we can adjust by 10/15. If we add, must pay retro to 4/1 and if
reduce, we
may not get any $ back.

Per the note below; this is 13,396/day x 11 days = 147,356. Some of the gas 
is connected to Interconnect Gas. In the past we have kept the Interconnect 
Gas whole by taking it to STOI. We will need some guidance on this tomorrow. 

Joann, let me know if you need help with the nom's... since there will be a 
lot of them to change around.

like donations for a playground in their neighborhood.  If you want to give a

This is slightly revised.

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4771 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 196 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

Subject: Re: SST Storage Injection Contract for Choice - PLEASE READ  

Jeff Porter at CES said in a 3/16 email...

 as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
 submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
 the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
 made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
 Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17.  Is it a problem that it 
wasn't March 15?

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945.  This is the CGAS citygate gas 
for Energy Express.  We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to 
Energy Express.  Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to 
change on this deal.

Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport 
CES actually has.  There should be some big changes in CES's transport 
numbers for June.  (Ex  ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract 
k#65403).  Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS,  
we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.  Any credits 
we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES.

Hope - approximately 1224 dth per day (this does not include Bayer and Eagle
Glass will swing)

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4585 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 382 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

Subject: FT-NT Fuel Percentages - Effective 11/1/00


September 14, 2000

To:  FT-NT Customers

Re:  Texas Gas Transmission Fuel Retention Effective 11/1/00

On August 31, 2000 Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas
Gas) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-518-000
to change the Effective Fuel Retention Percentage (EFRP)
under its Rate Schedule FT which Transco utilizes to render
service to its customers under its Rate Schedule FT-NT.
Texas Gas has proposed to change its EFRP from 3.37% to
3.27% for the Winter Season (November - March) and from
2.68% to 2.96% for the Summer Season (April - October). If
accepted as proposed, the revised Texas Gas fuel percentages
would result in the following changes in Transco's current
Rate Schedule FT-NT Fuel Percentages effective November 1,
2000.

Winter Season - 0.09% decrease
Summer Season - 0.26% increase

Please refer any questions to Risa Desmuke, Rate Department,
at (713) 215-3493.

The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM 
gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to 
get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and

I believe that is correct.  Of course, ENA will pass through to retail 
appropriate charges for retail transport.

I'm sure I asked this question before - ENA will be paying all transport cost 
for January, even if we did not get set up as agent, correct?

We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.  The volume is 34,248 
dts and the price is $2.22.  
I did not Bill CES for this deal.  According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the 
gas and we paid it back in January.  Tom said CES was going to pay us for 
this.  Should I bill the Retail group for this?  It looks more like a 
wholesale transaction.

Introducing your first SAP Paycheck!

This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of=20
Corporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is=20
reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below.

What=01,s Different?
? Your =01+home=01, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay adv=
ice.=20
This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial module=
s=20
of SAP.

? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P=01, represent earning t=
ypes=20
reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time f=
or=20
the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay=20
advice as =01+PVacation=01,.

? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instea=
d=20
of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions wil=
l=20
remain itemized in the deduction section.

? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-=
date=20
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the=20
year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This=
=20
change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your=
=20
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year=
=20
will reflect your earnings by company).

? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick=

day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the=

Payroll FAQ=01,s

My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stan=
d for?
There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For=
=20
some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to=20
print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions an=
d=20
prints them on one line =01) titled =01&other deductions=018.  The detail o=
f all=20
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intrane=
t=20
at eHRonline.enron.com.

What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?
These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at=20
hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.

Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?
Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected =

July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay ad=
vice=20
as =01+POvertime=01,.

What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)?
For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit =
is=20
applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to=20
another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amou=
nt=20
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FIC=
A=20
will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.

What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock=

options?
There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This=

CES has decided to take 600 dth/day of their Texas Gas Zone 4 length into 
CGAS at Lebanon for the 24th-29th.  To keep the deal tickets simple, I am 
showing a purchase from CES at Lebanon for 600 dth/day at the first of the 
month CGAS price. 

Joe, I created a purchase from CES (deal 202576).  Match this up with 600dth 
of deal 159319.

We will effectively be using 600 dth less of Dayton space for CES starting on 
the 24th.

I will let you know if things change.

1) What is the status of CNG Producing Company  - Deal #77755?  The contract  
was called Trag 110, 
and I see that in the service list on CNG Transmission, but it needs to be 
pathed starting 07/99 through current.
Also, the rates are showing up as:
Transportation       $.19910     but should be $.06
ACA                           $.00220     Should not be paying ACA
Compression          $.00000    Should be $.22

2)   What is the status of CNG Field Services - Deal #125711 (Marco Pipeline) 
- Coronado Pipeline  Enterprises?

I have more, but do you think that we could get these 2  taken care of 
today?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for 
production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on 
current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here! 

2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected 
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected 
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made 
effective 12/1999 production forward.  

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If 
necessary, please forward to your teams.
Thanks,
Carrie

Subject: Rates Corrections

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates 
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause 
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled via a manual line item.  

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date, 
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are 
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same 
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be 
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any 
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will 
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to 
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we 
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within 
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by 
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and 
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been 
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be 
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management 
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production 
forward.  

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by 
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, 
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  7/1 the 
following
day(s) as listed .    There are three worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

The metered production from Questa Petroleum is  "Behind CPA city gate".  
Questa's meter is in CES's Columbia of Pa Pool (or CDC Pool).  Heidi Boyd 
nominates this gas to the CES Retail customers each month from the pool.  
This gas is in addition to any other gas provided for CES by ENA.  Since it 
is "Behind the City Gate" no one at ENA has to nominate the physical flow of 
the gas.  The only reason a nomination needs to be made by an ENA scheduler 
is to allow payment to the producer.

 Chris Germany should be including this gas in the invoice for CES Retail.

This gas is under contract through October 2000.

John

The January check just arrived at Chantilly. Kathy is fedexing it directly to
Cash Management for morning delivery.  The late receipt is due to the fact 
that
it was addressed to the old Fairfax office and not to the Irvine CA address
requested on the invoice.   I just spoke to Robin Barbe (who checked with 
their
accounting staff) and understand that Enron feels that the effort to stop the
check, and immediately execute a wire transfer would not be productive.
Regards,
Roman

Subject:  January OPT 60 Payment

Joan,

CALP has received the wire transfer payment for the month of February (thank
you).  However, January's check , which was mailed on March 24th, has still 
not
arrived.  I have to make both a debt payment and a partner distribution on
Monday, April 3rd. Since the partners only receive distributions twice a year,
it would be helpful if CALP received Januarys payment.  Could Enron put a stop
payment on January's check and have the funds wire transferred to CALP's 
account
tomorrow?  Anything you could do would be helpful.

Thanks!

Paulette

Attached is the latest version. The retail numbers have been updated. The
transport numbers are currently being cross referenced to the master list John
Hodge has been cleaning up, in order to make sure everything is included. The
pricing was discussed yesterday between an ENA group and myself. I believe a
few minor changes are in order and need to be agreed upon.

Please forward any changes or questions to me. Thanks.

Brian, correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is the deal you did with Craig
Taylor.  Is this deal for more than 1 month?

Victor, Joann,  I remember not putting in a deal ticket because I thought it 
was
included in the first of the month numbers and we were going to treat this as 
a
financial deal.  Ask Scott Goodell to put it in.  I can't get into our lovely
Sitara system and hopefully I will be gone before you guys get in today.

Joann, if this gas will not flow on secondary transport from the pool for the
10th and the 11th, call my pager and leave a voicemail.  Also, if there are no
constraints and CES can take this gas over a couple of days (I know this will
not work for 7-5) then do that instead of prorating through the rest of the
month.

Sorry guys!!

On Jan 28th Brian did a spot deal with Chris for a total of 26817 dth to COH 
at
$3.06.  I did not include these volumes in my first of the month numbers
unfortunately so if you could hook me up now that would be much appreciated.
Here's the breakdown by market area:

5-2 1577

7-1 1823

7-5 22717

7-9 700

Please start the deliveries on the 10th.  I don't care how you deliver the
others but for 7-5 please prorate for the rest of the month if possible (1136
dth/day).

Thanks very much,
KD

You guys may know this already.  This contract only has 1% fuel when you take 
gas from Emporti to the VNG citygate.  k#65066, MDQ = 38,000


We can learn  more about this contract later.

Here is what I know.  We started pulling 430 MCF (443 dth) from pool N424PB 
effective 7-1-00 which was changed to 430 dth effective 7-18-00.  I'm 
assuming pool N424PB is the CES/ENA non-priority pool.  Let me know if we

Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day 
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 
for the month.  

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will 
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. 

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly 
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

Molly - Chris Germany preferred to have new deals for these.  These are 
necessary due to there being two different transportation adjustments for the

meters, but new deals are needed for the other meters.  Please modify 
existing deals and provide new deals as follows:

Crystal confirmed that items coded as a demand charge on physical forward 
deals in the "External Column" do not show up in our P&L.

Example:  See deal 113266, sale to Reliant.  I was concerned that we would 
double dip the reimbursements for transport demand charges if I show 
reimbursements on the transport sheet and we include the reimbursements on 
the Physical Forward sale as well.

Since they are pulling out of Major Accounts, not Retail, do we know how much 
of their volume at each location falls under Major Accounts?

Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

Scott & Chris-

This is mainly just an FYI so everyone has all the same information.  Earlier 
today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up 
the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any 
longer.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT 
Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business.    
Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a 
lot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some 
negotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees 
until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing, 
but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied 
to the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering 
his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their 
customer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their 
other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process 
confidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other 
questions about this conversation, please let me know. 

Scott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.   

Just as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing 
a hub service for Transco right now.

 Thanks!  -Angie

Linda and Sylvia....this is the counterparty that we spoke about yesterday 
that we have not yet received the signed consent form on so that all trades 
done prior to January (settled in January) need to settle through the CES - 
Cove Point......any additional info you have on this?   Are the 3 storage 
contracts new in 2000 and would be as Cove Point....where as December trades 
settle as CES - Cove Point when the consent has not been received....your

I understand we have the CES Cove Point  storage contracts set up as CES-Cove 
Point in global.  What is the status of the paperwork and who is following up 
on it.  Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North America 
now has 3 storage contracts.

Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the 
counterparty  instead of Cove Point for the January payment.  
The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the 
counterparty.

Chris,
Most companies send us their fixed-price bidweek data in this format. It's 
more
accurate since we just have to transfer the data instead of retyping 
everything
into our master database. It also saves time on days like today when we have 
to
turn everything over in a day. Anyone with questions can give me a call --
thanks!!

Robert, I entered a buy and a sale to capture the financial difference on 
CGAS, deals 318749 and 318750.  I may kill these deals if ENA purchases the 
gas back from CES at Mainline.  I'll keep you posted.

Hi team.  Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.  May not be a

Subject: CES Supply Management Agreement

New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market 
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our 
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below 
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on 
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will 
only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" as 
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct 
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load 
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the 
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being 
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.

2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for 
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would 
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In 
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also 
include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 
64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for 
CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and 
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the 
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase 
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All 
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I 
agreements.

3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity 
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I 
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your 
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity 
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our 
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to 
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for 
un-utilized capacity. 

4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.  
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar 
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power 
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only 
transactions would not be subject to this clause.    

I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss 
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next 
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your 
help.

Attached is the latest file on capacity.  I have updated the C&I list for
releases from O&R on Columbia Gulf and TCO, from BUG on TETCO and from LILCO 
on
Transco.  I have updated the Choice list for releases from Atlanta on CNG,
Sonat, South Georgia and Transco.   On the Wholesale list, I have reflected 
the
releases that we have made on Columbia Gulf, TCO and TETCO from capacity
associated with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and for the release from
South Jersey on Transco.  All of these changes are highlighted in blue.  The
following releases have not yet taken place for 1/2000, but should happen on
Monday or Tuesday:

C&I

CNG - Release from Hope for sale to Bayer
CNG - NiMo customers
TCO - Release from Eagle Point for sale to COH customers
TETCO - Dayton Power & Light customers
Texas Gas - Dayton Power & Light customers
Transco - PSNC customers
Trunkline - Dayton Power & Light customers


Choice

East Tennessee - Atlanta customers
Midwestern - NIPSCO customers
NGPL - NIPSCO customers
Tennessee - Atlanta customers

In the old days, you could only flow 7/12 of the MDQ from secondary points.
That was when these contracts were good for the whole year.  So you are
telling me the "rules have changed"?  I can now flow 100% from secondary
points?

You can use the full contract MDQ to move from and to secondary points.  Of
course,  this would be subject to any secondary restrictions.

We have a FTGSS contract with a MDQ of 40,148 dts.  The primary receipt
point on this contract is storage.  BUT, we can flow some of this gas from
secondary points like Oakford or the Pools.  How much gas can be sourced
from Secondary receipt points?

Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have 
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need 
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;

   "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they 
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM 
gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to 
get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and 
transmission contracts moved over.

   It's a Party and You're Invited


   Occasion:  Farewell Party - Joni Veselack
  Day:  Sunday, September 10
  Time:  4:00 p.m.
  Place:  Woods on Augusta (pool area)

 I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one
last get together around the pool!!! So, I decided to fire up the grill and
bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

 Please bring your own "Cheer".

 Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds
out of the gutter.) So, please let me know if you're attending.

Shawna,
I am Isabel and I work in Gas Settlements.  Could you help me out with the 
following?

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could 
you let me know if this correct.  Should Enron be charging demand charges?  
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if 
that is correct.  Please let me know if you are not the correct person to 
send this note too.  
Thank you for your help!

Subject: CES Central Desk Issues

I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

Scott misspelled your name.  I hope I have the right guy.

I listed one of the CES issues down below.  The other issue I have is 
pricing.  I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the 
pricing.  I will try to get with you this afternoon.  Just a note, I bet I 
spent at least 2.5 hours on the phone with CES last Friday.

Thanks

Subject: CES Central Desk Issues

I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.


Comments?

Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 
capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We 
have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets.  
According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's 
meter in Zone 4.

I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we 
need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01.

I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it 
because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge.

T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to 
terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that 
question.

I don't think we will be able to do any payback at Niagara or Tenn/E Aurora 
on the National Fuel deal.  After adjusting for what we took out today, we 
owe Nat Fuel about 88,500 dth.

Here are the points that I believe will work best

Tenn/Colden (meter #060003)  Tenn Zone 5 close to the Niagara Spur - we can 
use Dracut supply or Iroq/Wright supply.
Tenn/Lamont (meter #020072)  Tenn Zone 4 - we can use Cook School for this or 
Dan can flow long haul - Cook School is baseloaded into CNG.
Trco/Leidy - we currently have 1,000 dth from CGAS going into CNG - we can 
redirect this to Nat Fuel at no additional cost.

Beavy and I changed the following deals for July and August.  We took all the 
August activity to 0.  This is how these deals should be balanced

Deal 318562 with 318686.  And 318691 with 318682.

I'll look at the economics in the morning.

These are all the production purchases I am aware of.

CPA Class 90 - We sold to CES for June and we are trying to sell it to CES 
for July.  We have this production until October.

EOG - sold this to CES for June.  Currently, CES does not have any market for 
July.

NFGD PA and NYSEG, both deals are with Belden & Blake and both deals have 
been terminated.

PNG - we have no market for this gas for June..  We are probably going to 
cash out for the month of June.  Starting in July, I will be selling this gas 
to Clinton.  I don't have enough gas to fill the market so EES is filling in 
for the balance of the sale.  There are very few markets behind PNG.   I can 
handle this gas for the term of the deals  but I would rather transfer all of 
it to EES.

Equitrans

I just had a thought.  Just to keep you guys in the loop, I will send this 
type of stuff to you unless you tell me not too.  You don't need to do 
anything with it.  Its more of an awareness type thing.

We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

     As of  March 8, 2000,  the Storage Gas Balance for Contract 530586 was
2,944 dekatherms or 21%  full.

     CNG Transmission Corporation

?s (CNGT) Rate Schedule GSS,  Section 8.4
provides that if Storage Gas Balance is less than or equal to 16%, then CNGT?s
obligation to make deliveries from storage shall be reduced by 30%.  
Therefore,
when Storage Gas Balance falls below 16% or 2,236 dekatherms,  CNGT?s 
obligation
to make deliveries from this storage account shall be reduced from 210
dekatherms to 160 dekatherms.

     Please review,  monitor, and if necessary, adjust the storage withdrawals
to avoid overruns and the resulting penalties as provided in Section 35.3B of
the General Terms and Conditions.  If you have any questions, please feel free
to contact me at 304-623-8546.

Chris--Sheet2 of the attached file is the latest version of our gas needs for
March '00.   I have input the daily dth requirements for AGL that I sent you
via an earlier e-mail into the spreadsheet.  The daily totals of flowing gas
and storage withdrawals across the various delivery points into AGL are the
same as what I sent you earlier.

Three other caveats apply:
1-) Some of the numbers that we gave you earlier for some of the other 
programs
may have been updated.
2-) The storage withdrawal that is shown for BG&E's choice program is storage
that we control thru BG&E.  It is not storage that your people will nominate.
3-) As I said earlier, the COH Choice volumes shown as PRIMARY equal
(estimated) total requirements less storage withdrawal, only.  To the extent
that some of the March gas requirement has been previously hedged with you for
physical delivery to the TCO pool per Brian Peronne, we have not deducted 
these
volumes from the total gas requirement.

Please call me if you have questions, problems, etc.

Re:     Major 2001 Construction Projects

The projects listed below are the major pipeline and station
construction projects that are currently scheduled for the 2001
construction season.  Dates and duration of these jobs may change prior
to construction.  Additional information will be forthcoming on a
particular job if there are significant impacts to available capacity.

Unless specifically stated to the contrary, the following jobs will not
impact firm transportation.  However, based on past summer operating
conditions, it is anticipated that interruptible transportation services
(IT and secondary FT) may be impacted by some of the work.  The extent
of the impact will depend on operating conditions at the time of the
outages.

I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the 
Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian 
Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron 
experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team.

In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following:

? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters
? Create purchase deals in SITARA
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc.
? Review calc sheets
? Maintain purchase pricing
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co

Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the 
commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner 
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume 
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very 
important area.   

Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to 
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current 
workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we 
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during 
this transition time.

Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!

We bought 500 from COH (deal 155197) and sold it to CES (deal 155195) for the 
26th.  This deal was done without Brian's approval.  He seemed mildly annoyed

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

I just spoke with the lawyer.  We can't do anything until the end of 
September.  Then, if no one contest the will, I will go to court on a Friday 
morning and be appointed executor.  She said there needs to be 2 witnesses ( 
and the sons count, so does Mary) to testify that the signature on the will 
is Dad's.

We have WV produced TCo.  To my knowledge we have no Mountaineer.  CES never 
wanted to buy Mountaineer production because of the daily balancing for both 
the production and the end-user side.

What's the final answer.... do you need the enduser gas or do you want me to 
cut the enduser gas? P

 If you really need the enduser gas... the only other option is for me... is 
to beg TCO to let me inject some pool gas into storage for that gas day to 
avoid the $10 withdrawal penalty... but we would still incur the overrun 
charge plus the additional overrun charge to get the gas into storage. Need a 
decision by 1 pm CST time on Monday, January 31st. Thank you!!!! 

Please pass this note to Melissa... still don't have her e-mail address.

Can't wait for it to warm up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: TCO STOW Overage - 1/24

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount 
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn. 
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES 
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. 
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. 
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage 
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what 
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling 
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any 
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the 
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES 
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES 
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to 
cause unnecessary pain.

Hey Chris,

 It is deal number 348443 that is set up as a sale (for Aug. - Nov.) to 
Clinton Gas Marketing and should be Clinton Energy Management.  I couldn't 
find the other supply numbers that you were asking about...  Could you get 
this changed in the system to reflect Clinton Energy Management?  Thanks...

Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  

I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate 
production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on 
the EOG and 
Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.

Yes, CES Retail did take this gas for Jan, Feb & March.  The Canonsburg 
office was responsible for the noms.  
 Yes, the deal needs to be input into Sitata.  Maybe, Terry can input.  Wade 
has copies of the monthly invoices from T & F Operating for all three months.

Deal details:
Volume = 10,000 MCF per month
Price for Jan, Feb & Mar = $3.465 / MCF
I would not worry about the Mcf issue here.  Just put the volumes and price 
in and pay the bill.

T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to 
terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question.

Need your assistance.   Obviously I need your expertise on Tennessee (and
someone's on Transco).   We need to get gas to S. Ct. and Ct. Natural 
citygates
for February.

Here's a what if...........I just spoke with a Tennessee rep to ask about
Transco Rivervale and Tennessee.   They are currently allowing short hauls at
this point.     However,  could we bring in some Transco at Rivervale and do a
short haul on Tennessee Mawaw (spelling)?   As of today I was told it could
flow to the above citygate meters.   (although this could change overnight).
I know we did this a few times last winter also.

How does Transco look for this?    As you can tell I am not even aware of the
economics.   If this would work what would it cost?  Can you check with Chris
(I don't know his e-mail address)?

Robin only bought 2074 dt's for the 2nd.  According to the sheet, the Tenn Z6 
volumes were 2220 dt's.  I told Brian at CES we were going to short Energy 
North by 146 dt's (the requested 1227 dt's but we only have 1081 dt's).  

Please let me know how you sourced the gas.

Based on the Atlanta requirements for 3/1/00, I have summarized below the
volumes I anticipate flowing on the 1st, assuming Enron elects to continue
basing ETNG, then Transco, and finally Sonat:


IBSS  13,802

ETNG    4,083

Transco  5,332

Sonat/SGNG  3,941


I spoke with Phil Villagomez and got the ETNG contract # ... now I just need
the Transco contract #'s and associated volumes.

Thanks,

David

I need to have a CES counterparty set up in global please.

Customer Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership (CALP)
  12500 Fair Lakes Circle, Suite 200
  Fairfax, VA 22033-3804

I don't think CALP has assigned the contract to ENA.

I have a copy of the agreement if anyone needs to see it.

Thanks

ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14.  
The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a 
purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put 
in some of the buy/sale activity.

My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright 
one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days 
we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at 
Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add 
another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy

Actually, my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year 
round.  This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand 
during the summer.  Depending on the relationship you would like to have with 
the customer, I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and 
the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport 
(at least with the way things work in our systems).

Paulette,

It's not Enron's intention to have Calp fund the OPT 60 payment. Enron
would like for Calp to release the capacity in Enron's name during the
winter period, and this would send the bills directly to Enron and
eliminate funding by Calp and reimbursement of Enron to Calp. We can look
at this again next winter. I'm not sure why there was a delayed payment
once Calp gave Enron the bill a month ago. I'll ask Mark Feldman about wire
transfers.

Thanks again for your patience.

Joan,

The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was
never
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed
February's
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have
January and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?

Thanks!

Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday

Thank you for your patience during this transition.

Attached is additional information from CES regarding administration of the 
GELP deal.  They have given us the contact at CGV to discuss the meter 
reading process--Joan, can you follow up with CGV to find out how this is 
going to work?  Also, Kim saved these documents in the same directory that 
Joan put all the last documents in (in the GELP directory) and she has also 
printed them out.  If you want hard copies, just ask her.  Just for the 
record, the good news is that the winter is almost over and that seems to be 
when most of the work under this contract occurs--once the summer is here 
there is a back to back deal with Duke for gas supplies.  The other good news 
is that it looks like you all will get the opportunity to learn quite a bit 
about fuel oil.  The bad news is that there doesn't seem to be too much up 
side in this deal.  The $5,000 monthly fee is about all you get unless you 
can get gas to them between November and February and receive your $.05 fee 
on that volume.  

Anyway, CES is planning on our taking over both the GELP and CALP contracts 
the first week of March.  This will give us 3 weeks of administering it and 
asking all of our questions before the CES contacts are no longer there.  
This means we need to very quickly decide who is going to prepare which 
reports, how exactly we will handle the fuel oil deliveries (will the gas or 
fuel oil guys handle this?), meter reading, contact lists, etc,   I realize 
it is bid week and very difficult to get you all together, but I'd like to 
have a quick meeting on Monday, February 28 at 11:00 am in Room 3125B to 
discuss the GELP and CALP contracts.  Please let me know if you cannot make 
it.  Thank you.

Subject: GELP, additional information


First, I wanted to follow up yesterday's question on GELP meter reading and 
how
Enron gets this information in the future.  I can't provide a direct answer to
this question, but can provide a contact at Columbia Gas of Virginia to 
discuss
the situation.   Lisa Jesse is the Industrial Account Rep. (at 804-323-5343)
and quite familiar with GELP.  I am making her aware of the transition and 
will
briefly discuss the options available.  You should probably make contact for
more relating to LDC information and equipment.

Also, I wanted to forward some examples of the fuel oil information we handle.
The "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" and "1999_2000 Winter Oil Orders" will give you 
an
idea of where we actually stand as of this morning and where I am in the
February tracking process.  On the "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" attachment you 
will
see delivery by delivery, plant Vs BOL (transporter delivery tickets) and a
summary sheet that identifies any discrepancies fairly quickly.  We are
provided the actual delivery tickets via mail, from the Plant (weekly), and
maintain those records.  The paragraph below is basically a repeat from the
original note, but I wanted to make sure the information wasn't missed.



We are responsible for the procurement, coordination and tracking of their 
fuel
oil activities through the winter period.  We've relied on CITGO, BPAmoco and
Marathon Ashland to provide the bulk of our oil supplies in the past.  The 
only
means of transporting oil to this facility is truck and the above suppliers
have been good about coordinating delivery to the facility.  GELP has a 5
million gallon oil tank on site and need to maintain 4.5 million gallons of
inventory through the winter period (FLASH... due to oil prices and
availability, this is under consideration).  The Plant has very specific
requirements prior to accepting delivery from any supplier... they demand a
specific 'Sulfur content' test (ASTM D-2622 test) be performed, sent, and
approved by Plant personnel prior to allowing any transporters into their
facility.  I have also included basic fax covers sent during this process
including the actual confirmation of placing the order, having the appropriate
oil testing and then faxing the test results to the Plant upon receiving them
from suppliers.

Again, let us know if you need anything further.  Thanks.

CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas 
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is 
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new 
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the 
January transaction is complete.

Here are my questions/comments;

1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.  
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.  
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the 
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.

2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to 
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment 
was due.

3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it 
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?

4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES 
deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who 
should he talk to about that??


Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

Thanks

FYI.  Effective 4/1/2000, ENA will no longer have the Rubin Resources gas at 
Hastings.  He had about 10,000 dths a month at Hastings.  However, we will 
continue to get his gas at Bridgeport, which was only one meter.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Re: PNG Local Production July 00


Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300
day from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be
4,000 for the month.

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to
Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool
gas.

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates
it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do
it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was
not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out
there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I
will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is
the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

65534 is 149349 in Sitara
 65403 was 149346 as ENA agent for CES.  I created deal 214854 for April 1 
forward, since Joann has pathed it for March.
 The demand was not correct on the first so I fixed it also.
I will update the sheet when you exit the original.

Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the 
2000ces02.xls sheet.  I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and 
highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to 
Sitara.

problem for you.

Thanks!

Just got off of the phone with Enron.   Due to the meter bounce that they are
doing because of the restriction, there will be a  reduction @ the gate (meter
#52) of 370 dth.   Donna, you originally requested 2050 dth, it will now be
1680 dth.   I have been told that you should see the entire 1680 dth.
Unfortunately, you will have to redo your Boston noms.

Fred with Equitable said he has 2 deals with CES.

1.  Tennessee - Equitable is selling CES 2,500 day delivered to Zone 4 at 
NYMX + .35.  Equitable has the trigger and this deal goes through March 
2000.  CES is currently receiving this gas at Beldon & Blake.

2.  Tetco - CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April and Equitable is giving 
CES 100,000 dth in January 2000 delivered to Tetco M2.  CES has(or will) pay 
Equitable $.65 for the exchange.  We call this a synthetic storage deal.

Do you know anything about these deals?

  I am pleased to announce the appointment of Paul F. Egner,
III to Director, Customer Services & Scheduling for the Transco pipeline
system. In his new position, Paul will oversee Transco's Northern and
Southern Market Area, Transportation Marketing, Scheduling, Electronic
Development & Commerce, Market Area Operations Accounting, Production Area
Operations Accounting and Imbalance Control.

  This new opportunity comes in recognition of the tremendous
job Paul has done while serving as Director, Gas Management & Control for
Transco, a position he has held since 1997. Prior to that, Paul held various
management positions of increasing responsibility in Gas Control, Customer
Service and Transportation Marketing. Egner joined Transco's engineer
training program in 1984, completing assignments in the Transmission
Department's Corpus Christi division office and in Offshore Pipeline Design.

  His experience in these various areas within Transco make
him an ideal candidate for this position.

  Please join me in congratulating Paul on this well-deserved
appointment.

I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission 
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I 
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.  
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
expense.


According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these 
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small.  
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

Questions??

Subject: market exits


Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

We also sold CES 5000 dth at BG&E, I am entering this deal as a Transco 
sale.  However, we may move it to CGAS.  I'll keep you posted.

Chris,
As we discussed, please get with Brenda Fletcher and set this up as a demand 
to pay the .0153 storage fee, since the pathing does not allow me to pay 
through the Volume system.  As long as it is on the deal, it will show up in 
Settlements and I can pay.  Also, I need it done from January 2000 to current.

Thanks,
Mark

I'm sure I asked this question before - ENA will be paying all transport cost 
for January, even if we did not get set up as agent, correct?

Wade, please forward this to the person that pays Statoil.  AND I just faxed 
you a copy of the invoice Kara faxed me.  I believe Heidi Boyd told me that 
ENA was not  making payments to Statoil so CES made the payments.  Let me 
know what you find out.

Please include Scott Goodell on all responses.

Hello!

As you know, Terry Franklin is beginning to transition into the Appalachian 
coordination role.  We spent time today with Bryce Baxter, Wade Price, and 
Gloria Barkowsky to determine how best to attack the current issues.

As Job 1, we determined that Terry's time is best utilized on transportation 
contract set-up.  Of course, Terry "job description" includes other tasks, 
but at this time, this is her #1 focus.  We decided this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Deals cannot be pathed without transportation contracts set-up in SITARA.
2.  In order to pay the producers and the pipeline, the deals must be pathed 
by Logistics (zero volume paths), and volumes must by allocated (based on 
actuals) by Gloria Barkowsky, Volume Mgmt.
3.  Wade Price, Settlements, is focused on setting up SITARA deals for 
producer wellhead purchases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Thanks,
Carrie

This is just a reminder that there is a confidentiality agreement between ENA 
and CES regarding the retail business that prohibits ENA wholesale from 
discussing any aspect of the CES Retail business with EES.  If you receive 
any calls from EES people about the CES retail business, please inform them 
of this prohibition on discussions. If we receive consent from CEG/Nisource 
at some point in time, I will let you know.  Thank you.

I have confirmed after talking with Jeff Hodge that ENA and EES cannot 
discuss anything regarding the CES retail business.  Both the CA and the 
Retail Agreement have sections that explicity mention that  ENA has to keep 
information confidential.   I talked with Jeff Golden, who is working on the 
EES side and mentioned that there can be no discussions between EES and ENA 
regarding the CES Retail business without first gaining the written consent 
of Nisource/CEG.

Jeff - If I have misstated anything, please let me know.

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 markets until Monday, 12/27.  We will need a
range from 2800 dth to 3600 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for 
these
types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

"Moths"

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you
naked?" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you."

"Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

"Who the fuck are you?" the man asks

"I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with."

The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

"Those little bastards!"

Heidi,

 Per Jim Kuhn @ Belden & Blake, the volumes contracted for for NYSEG 
production are as follows:
 APR = 216 DTH/Day
 MAY = 179 DTH/Day
 JUN = 160 DTH/Day
 JUL = 192 DTH/Day
 AUG = 195 DTH/Day
 SEP = 191 DTH/Day
 OCT = 190 DTH/Day

Does CES need these volumes??

BBC has additional volumes for sale for the period Apr/Sep.  They are trying 
to seel the gas for the entire period vx monthly.  If you have an idea what 
volumes you need monthly for Apr/Oct, I will try to purchase from BBC.

Yesterday, Logistics, Volume Management and the CGAS Trader met to discuss 
pathing arrangements for the CES Storage deal.

 C R I T I C AL   I N F O R M A T I O N   F O R   V O L U M E   M A N A G E M 
E N T
  * All Storage Account Balances for contracts 67713, 51407 and 39607 should 
not be valued as an ENA asset
   - The storage inventory is CES's inventory and NOT owned by ENA.
   - The storage inventory on contracts 67713, 51407 and 39607 should NOT be 
part of the UA4 calculation
   - Fuel associated with storage injection should be part of 
  * The "Select Point" feature will be used to create the sale to CES in 
storage.  This pathing process will allow deal
     to be settled. 
   -The "Point" balances should NOT be part of the UA4 calculation
   

Logistics is in the process of correcting pathing arrangements for the 
injection season to match the schematic as provided below.  Once this is 
completed, Volume Management can complete the actualization process.

Logistics did make part of the corrections needed for the withdrawal season, 
to allow actualization on the storage contract; yet did not redo the 
transportation piece.   Due to this, the pipeline is not in balance.  

Logistics would like to meet with Volume Management and discuss this clean up 
process.  I will try to set up a meeting for next week (Anastas, Kelly, 
Lamadrid, Collins, Fuller, Superty & me).   How does Wednesday afternoon 
(9/20/00 at 2 p.m.) look for you guys?  

Please get with me if you have any questions.  If you could also please 
forward to anyone I may have excluded from this email.

Thanks,

dg

Pathing arrangements for CES Storage deals should be created following the 
schematics below.

I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?  
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts 
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).  
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe 
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my 
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing 
shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks

Subject: Update from India



Friends,
Greetings from India.  Just a brief update to let you all know what is
happening.  This week I finished a 3 week teaching course on the Book of
Romans, with 8 students from one of the schools in Kodai.  I think that is
the most exciting thing I have ever done in my life.  I asked the students
one day who lead them to Christ.  Everyone single one of them have been
saved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing in
their school over the last year.  But what was even more exciting than that
was the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family.  All of the
others were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family.
That young man's name is Anifa.  He came to Christ through one of the
pograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown so
much, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion to
Christ.  Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord.  Anifa
will honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole school
knows that he is a man of prayer.  Recently Anifa asked me if I would teach
him how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go back
and reach his people for Jesus.
Until Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated,
because I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won a
single Muslim to Christ.  Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because I
have won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others.
Please be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates,
and a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler.
They will be coming in June and July.  We will be starting 2 new Churches,
and ministering in the schools.
And please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that was
started last summer by the team from Southwestern.
I look forward to seeing you all this year.  Angela and I are praying about
God's direction for our future.  Please pray with us that for God's guidance
as we plan for our future together.  God bless.

Chad Germany

Chris,
As we discussed, please get with Brenda Fletcher and set this up as a demand 
to pay the .0153 storage fee, since the pathing does not allow me to pay 
through the Volume system.  As long as it is on the deal, it will show up in 
Settlements and I can pay.  Also, I need it done from January 2000 to current.

Thanks,
Mark

It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year.

Subject: Re: Local Production for June  

If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books 
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES 
- Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to 
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has 
been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized 
after 1/1/00, then it should be entered without the CES prefix (statoil). 
Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with 
the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 
'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use 
the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered 
with the CES prefix.

John, can you fill in the missing details?

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Subject: Local Production for June

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

I just entered a commodity rate on deal 299159.  It has very big volumes on 
it each month and there has not been a commodity rate on it.  Joanne just 
verified that this is regular transport, not Dayton or CALP.  This will be a 
big OA variance for June - August.

This deal is for deliveries to Storage.  Would you verify if ACA and GRI are 
billed for storage deliveries please?

FYI - we are moving our local production behind Peoples to Clinton's pool.

John, I assume you will be the one talking to the producer.

Paul,

An Amendment to Appendix "C" will need to completed by both the pool that the
meters are being transferred from and the pool that the meters are being
transferred to.  I have discussed this issue with Heidi Boyd at Columbia 
Energy
and I believe she will complete this form on their behalf in order to delete 
the
meters.  You will also need to complete this form in order to add the meters 
to
Clinton's LGA pool once the Pooling Agreement has been completed and the pool
becomes effective.  I will fax the form to Heidi this morning.  It must also 
be
signed by the producer.  Please confirm your fax number (614-760-2794) and I
will be happy to fax the form to you as well.

Carol

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi Karen,

Please nominate a volume of 24,800 dth's for the month of July 00 for CES'
local production.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our
local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the local
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will need
to mention in the letter?

Thanks,
Heidi Boyd

Revision in bold.  Pass on to any who may need this.

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the "other" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
"Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed."
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent
  contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the Pipeline contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated 
rates, uncheck them as well.  The "primary" deal will carry the MDQ and
  any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.
 Hit Release.
e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number 
in the Service list now read "Multiple".  Right-click/Service Deals will list 
the  specific deals.
f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message 
should not appear again.

This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.
Please file this in your "Call Dave If I Can't Find This" folder.

Thanks, d.n.

I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this 
ticket), 268090, and 268093.

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this 
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the 
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Dominion Transmission Gathering Charges

On Thursday, December 7,2000, IOGA WV and Dominion Transmission (formerly CNG 
Transmission)  announced that they have reached a five year agreement on 
gathering rates.  Although this agreement is subject to FERC's approval, 
there should be no problem having FERC OK.

This agreement becomes effective January 1, 2001.  Under the agreement, 
Dominion WILL NOT invoice either the producer or his agent (i.e. ENA) for 
gathering or processing.  Instead, Dominion will increase the gas retention 
percentages to cover the costs of both gathering and processing.  They are:

                                                       1/1/2001 - 6/30/2003   
                 7/1/2003 - 12/31-2005

Transmission Dry                                       
0                                                          0
Transmission Wet                                  
3.91%                                                  3.51%
Gathering Dry                                           
9.34%                                                   9.34%
Gathering Wet                                          
13.25%                                               12.85%           

As of yesterday, Dominion was not sure exactly how they will communicate  the 
production information to the producer and/or his agent.  My guess is that 
they will send a  monthly statement which willl have two volumes for each 
meter.  The first volume will be the wellhead volume delivered to the meter 
(a gross volume) .  This volume will be adjusted by the retention percentage 
which will equate to the sales volume (gross volume less gathering and/or 
processing).  The sales volume will be the volume we will pay the producer 
for since it will be net of gathering and/or processing.  There will be no 
additional charges.  ENA will not be required send monies to Dominion.

As additional information becomes available, I will forward.

John

After discussing the CES reconciliation project with commercial, I confirmed 
that manual invoices had been generated for CES business on at least CGAS and 
Atlanta Gas Light (Sonat portion).  Deals initially entered into Sitara on 
the CES acquisition could not be utilized especially on CGAS for invoicing 
purposes.  Thus Unify volumes were not used for these invoices / payments / 
netouts.  P/L reports were instead utilized.  In light of this information, 
there's a good possibility that actual volumes on deliveries, storage 
withdrawals / injections and netouts were not captured accurately in 
Unify/Sitara and so we don't show any receivables out there for CES. 

Our scheduler on CGAS, Joann Collins, has requested archived information from 
CGAS for CES volumes from January - March 2000.  In the interim, as we 
discussed, we should definitely invoice and recieve payment from CES for the 
$$$ they want to pay us.  Afterwards, we'll need to review our historical 
manual invoices and imbalance accounts with CES to see where we actually 
stand .  Any thoughts???  THANKS

Scott--The volumes delivered into Central Hudson off Iroquois for Arma 
Textiles
was included in Exhibit 1 of the 12/99 Energy Purchase Agreement such that it
would appear that Enron would be supplying this gas to CES.   However, the gas
to supply Arma was already purchased from Duke Energy, and as far as I can
tell, Enron has had nothing to do with delivering this gas, and Duke Energy 
has
billed us directly for the gas that they supply each month.

I discussed this with Chris Germany, and we agreed that CES would just deal
directly with Duke Energy on this and leave Enron out of it.    Accordingly, 
if
you look at the May'00 first-of-the-month request that I sent to Enron on 
April
24, the table does show 135 dth/day into Central Hudson off Iroquois.  
However,
the table notes that this gas is being supplied by Duke Energy and therefore 
no
volumes are being requested from Enron.

Please let me know if this needs further action or clarification.

Thanks.

Enron is probably not familiar with the deal as they did not have to make
any
nominations.  Although, the deal was documented each month on the memos and
spreadsheets that were sent to Enron.  I do not have a contact at Duke.  It
was
my understanding that both parties (Duke and Arma) knew the deal was a
fixed
quantity.

When I was assigned Central Hudson in January I was told that there was one
customer behind the gate and that was Arma Textiles.  Arma was backed 100%
by a
Duke purchase that subseqently went with the Enron sale.  I was informed by
the
previous scheduler that all CES did was to make the nomination based on GMS
at
bidweek.   It was a stand alone deal that CES nominated based on GMS.

Subject: Arma Textiles

Kim,

 I am in the process of assigning this customer to a new marketer. A
review of the file shows a recent correspondence concerning tariff gas
purchased by Arma between Kurt Marburger & Charlie Dalphon. Are you able to
shed any light on the issue? There is a significant outstanding balance and
I
believe the customer has made the decision to stop payment until credits
are
issued for the tariff charges.

 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Scott

I was wondering if this would work:  

Problem:  Third party demand reimbursements for transport are kept on 
spreadsheets.  I would like to automate this process.  

Solution:  Is it possible to enter a capacity ticket with a counterparty 
(like ConEd), not a pipeline, and show a negative amount (or the opposite of 
what we enter in when we are paying out a charge) therefore resulting in a 
credit to the desk for that amount?    Would the system accept such an entry 
and would this generate the proper documentation for accounting?

For example, if the East Desk has a deal where ConEd releases capacity to ENA 
at max rate, but then reimburses ENA for the demand charge (ENA pays the 
commodity costs), the tickets would be entered as follows:
 1) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charges of $.10, 
Counterparty = Transco   -   ENA will pay $$$ to the pipeline
 2) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charge of -.10, 
Counterparty = Con Ed        -   ENA will receive $$$ from ConEd

It seems like this should work and would eliminate one more manual piece of 
this transport p&l.  
Please advise.

Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change 
the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound 
correct to you?

Please let me know.

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify 
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting 
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in 
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type 
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production 
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the 
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't 
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the 
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream 
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

Just a note that as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

Attached is the backup fro the Jan, Feb and Mar for Belden & Blake's NYSEG 
invoices.  I created these spreadsheets from the information given me by 
Heidi Boyd, who was the person nominating this gas for CES.  Belden & Blake 
invoiced ENA base on these spreadsheets.
 The NYSEG gas is a back to back purchase/sale to CES.  There should be a 
deal for the sale in the system for the sale.  Check with Chris Germany.
There are three price scenarios for the gas.  Should there be a spereate  
deal for each price?

There is a 280/day sell that has been taken out of CES 39999 pool on Southern 
Public's K#'s for January. If I remember correctly, this has happened over 
the past few months. This deal ticket never made it in Enron's System, so I 
created a ticket 149375 (Enron's deal ticket #).

Enron's deal confirmation team says this deal does not exist and there is a 
CES person on this team. 

Pease give us the GMS deal number,and if you know the riskworks deal number. 
If you have a copy of the deal ticket fax it to me at 713-646-2102.

Thanks.

Hey Team.  I need the following services set up on National Fuel.

IAS  <== we just created k# A02353
ISS  <== I think we already have this set up on k#H02262
FSS  <== Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.


Believe me, this all happened really fast.  I just sent some of the paperwork 
to legal and I need it back by Monday morning.

Subject: New and Exciting National Fuel Deal


We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

I need a volunteer.  The "Vol" will be responsible for pricing all of The New 
Power deals in the market area.   99% of this activity takes place on CGAS.  

Who wants it?  Certain people have expressed an interest in learning  more 
about pricing, Tricia Spence, Joe Casas, and Beverly  Beaty.



I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month, and about 
4-6 hours during bidweek.  I also believe this deal will go away effective 
4/1/2001.

Pros
Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing 
guru like myself.
Will learn a great deal about transport pricing.
May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over 
until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing. 
Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con)
Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the 
desk P&L.



Cons
Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be.
May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions.  
I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer.
I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend, AND I'm 
very detail oriented.
I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the 
job very serious.

Subject: Capacity question

I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel 
waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on 
the secondary capacity deal ticket?

Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing 
from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?

Attached is the latest file on capacity.  I have updated the C&I list for
releases from O&R on Columbia Gulf and TCO, from BUG on TETCO and from LILCO 
on
Transco.  I have updated the Choice list for releases from Atlanta on CNG,
Sonat, South Georgia and Transco.   On the Wholesale list, I have reflected 
the
releases that we have made on Columbia Gulf, TCO and TETCO from capacity
associated with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and for the release from
South Jersey on Transco.  All of these changes are highlighted in blue.  The
following releases have not yet taken place for 1/2000, but should happen on
Monday or Tuesday:

C&I

CNG - Release from Hope for sale to Bayer
CNG - NiMo customers
TCO - Release from Eagle Point for sale to COH customers
TETCO - Dayton Power & Light customers
Texas Gas - Dayton Power & Light customers
Transco - PSNC customers
Trunkline - Dayton Power & Light customers


Choice

East Tennessee - Atlanta customers
Midwestern - NIPSCO customers
NGPL - NIPSCO customers
Tennessee - Atlanta customers

If you have any questions, please call Scott Goodell or myself.

Chris-

(It's Clayton, on my UT account from home)

I may have the perfect girl for you; she's a 29-year old *beauty* in
Ukraine, one of my wife's best-friends, about 5'2" in height, slim,
smart but a bit quiet and introspective, who really wants to meet a
quality guy and get married and have children. She had her heart broken
by her first love, a guy who dumped her for a girl in Kiev whose father
gave the guy a good job. It seems the quality guys, as few as they are,
all want to marry a rich girl and want only money andnot children.

I'll bring a picture of her by your office tomorrow.

One hang-up- she doesn't speak English very well (yet). But, where
there's a will, there's a way.

Clayton

Fred and everyone else on the string of E-mails I received:

OK - since I received numerous copied and forwarded E-mails on this
International Paper issue, I felt it best to copy everyone.  As I understand
what is going on -  CES has an obligation to deliver gas to International 
Paper
through March, 2000.  I agree with Colleen that CES is obligated by the terms
of our agreement to purchase this gas from Enron through March, 2000.  As far
as the Energy Management functions, these duties are not part of the Enron
Retail contract.

The real problem that has arisen with International Paper is that they have
some ill feelings towards Enron for some reason.  We have attempted to smooth
this over but it appears that the gentleman at International Paper has a big
burr in his saddle that I nor anyone at CES can remove.  International Paper
refuses to execute any paperwork required by the pipelines to allow Enron to
nominate gas.  Since this is such a short term deal, I would recommend that a
CES transition employee nominate the gas and work out the logistics with Enron
to get the gas to International Paper and keep them happy.  Whatever CES and
Enron need to do from an accounting standpoint to make sure Enron is made 
whole
can be handled fairly easily I would assume.

As far as business after March, 2000, International Paper has no obligation to
purchase gas from CES.  So if they do not purchase gas from CES, then Enron
will not be affected after March 2000.  If International Paper does execute an
extension to their gas purchase agreement or enter into a new purchase
agreement then we will definitely need to get this agency problem worked out.
Please feel free to call me at 713-693-2552 should any of you have any
questions regarding the foregoing.  Thank you.

Kendrick

Melissa,

I'm not sure if you are the correct person to receive this message.  We have 
been checking with all the applicable pipelines to make sure the transport 
and storage capacity is back in BUNY's name as of April 1.  All of the 
pipelines appear to be on board, but Texas Gas and TETCO specifically seem to 
be expecting some correspondence from BUNY to this effect.  We want to make 
sure all of this goes smoothly next week, so could you guys let us know where 
this stands in your shop?

Thanks.
Kate

I created a purchase from CES (deal 149778) to replace the CPR STORAGE deal.  

Victor, please move the daily volumes to deal 149778.  As far as I can tell, 
ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas.  So, we should show a 
purchase from CES for the storage gas.  Of course it will get much more 
complicated once we resolve all of the retail issues.

I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the
end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing shipper 
is
and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks

Dick will be doing some deals with New Power that is seperate from the "Asset 
Management" deal.  Following are the spot deals Dick has done with Mike Garred

Deal  Vol  Price  Comment
516083  10000  8.00  sell to NP for the 5th at the pool
521475  20000  8.28  sell to NP for the 6th-31st at the pool - I killed deal 
516286 which was in Sitara as a purchase from NP.
510586  1435  7.20  buy from NP at WGL on the 1st
513896  1500  7.25  buy from NP at WGL on the 2nd-4th


These deals have no impact on the "asset management" deal with New Power.

Chris,

The term ticket in TAGG is for 1500/d @ .434.  Where is the remaining volume 
so that the hedge ties.

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Subject: Local Production for June

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi Karen,

Please nominate a volume of 24,800 dth's for the month of July 00 for CES'
local production.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our
local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the local
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will need
to mention in the letter?

Thanks,

Paulette,

It's not Enron's intention to have Calp fund the OPT 60 payment. Enron
would like for Calp to release the capacity in Enron's name during the
winter period, and this would send the bills directly to Enron and
eliminate funding by Calp and reimbursement of Enron to Calp. We can look
at this again next winter. I'm not sure why there was a delayed payment
once Calp gave Enron the bill a month ago. I'll ask Mark Feldman about wire
transfers.

Thanks again for your patience.

Joan,

The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was
never
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed
February's
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have
January and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?

Thanks!

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

John

We are trying to schedule this gas for today.  Joann, you are getting 245 
dt's from Reyna off ANR.  I created a sale to CES (deal 160410) at a price of 
$3.75.

Brian, I made need to adjust this price.  It won't be much of an adjustment 
and we can talk about that later.

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi Karen,

Please nominate a volume of 24,800 dth's for the month of July 00 for CES'
local production.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our
local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the local
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will need
to mention in the letter?

Thanks,

Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at 
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example 
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay 
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed 
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for 
overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a 
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn 
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The trader's spread is 
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would 
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.  
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have 
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity. 
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum 
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of 
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and 
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take 
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the 
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline, 
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

Clayton

Subject: Re: Questions  

Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

Subject: Questions


Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

The CGAS exchange deals I set up for CGAS storage end Oct 31st.  I'm thinking 
of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  ENA billed CES (now 
New Power) for the gas delivered to storage.  Now ENA needs to pay New Power 
for the gas taken out of storage.

In my example, we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e 
effective 11/1/2000.

Take a look - let me know if you have any comments.

Subject: storage clarification & issues


Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

I think selling the Power Gas Marketing gas to EES behind EOG is working well 
(other than the price).  I would like to sell it to EES for the term of the 
deal.  You have not sold it to anyone have you?  If not, I'm going to try to 
sell it to EES for the term.  And if I remember correctly, the volume is 
10,000/month and the term is 10/31/2000, correct?

Steve, I talked to Cindy Burnette about SIT Penalties in February on Monday, 
3/13/2000. Unfortunately Joann and I thought the SIT withdrawal Penalty was 
lifted on 2/3/2000 and reinstated on 2/17/2000. We did not realize that TCO 
lifted the penalty for only one day on 2/3/2000 and reinstated it on 
2/4/2000. TCO lifted it again on 2/15/2000 and reinstated it on 2/17/2000. 
Joann and I missed the period from 2/4/2000 to 2/14/2000.

In early February, Cindy talked to Joann and I about matching the burns to 
the best reading around noon of the gas day that just ended. Because TCO 
allows it shippers to  use SIT, our goal is try to match the burn to about 
500 dkt difference. There are some days we will go a little longer and some 
days we will go a little shorter. Our February 2000 monthly goal was to hit 
close to zero. I'm attaching a spreadsheet that shows Enron's net SIT for 
February was +288. Joann and I also realize that when SIT withdrawal is not 
allowed, that we need to send extra gas to the burn and then back off the gas 
once the actuals are received. 

The attached spreadsheet shows that on days 2/4/2000 to 2/6/2000 that Enron 
had 17,753 Broadrun gas going into Enron's IPP pool. Each day the SIT 
withdrawal was less than 500 dkt. On day 2/9/2000, we did adjust the actuals 
to meet the burn and Joann sent the print screens to Cindy on 3/10/2000 for 
proof to waive the penalties. On gas days 2/11/2000 to 2/14/2000, we were 
short less than 500 dkt and we had 5684 broadrun gas going to the pool. On 
2/18, we did adjust the actuals to meet the burn and sent the screen prints 
to Judy on 3/6/2000 for proof to waive the penalties for that day.

Joann and I are very competent and experienced schedulers and were not trying 
to game TCO's system by abusing the SIT withdrawals. We just didn't realize 
that TCO had reinstated the penalties for SIT withdrawal for 2/4/2000 to 
2/14/2000. The way TCO posts on the bulletin board, it is not always clear to 
the shippers when penalties situations are lifted and reinstated.

My other concern was how this penalty was communicated to us. Julie called me 
on 3/6/2000, and said that Judy wanted Julie to send to me the 8 series 
report. I told Julie I had no idea what she was talking about, but go ahead 
and send the report. When I received the report, it was the report we had 
used for overrun charges. We did not occur overrun changes, so I was not 
concerned with the report. Then Cindy called me about an hour later on 
3/6/2000 to tell me we had Hopewell penalties. I told Cindy I didn't 
understand what penalties we had incurred, since there were no overrun 
charges. She said we had SIT withdrawal penalties. Joann and I looked at days 
1, 2, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We faxed over the proof to TCO for day 18, that 
we had matched the burns to the readings available at noon that day. Joann 
specifically asked Judy if this was the only penalty we had, and Judy was not 
100 % sure but thought so. 

There were no further conversations between TCO Team 3 and Enron about the 
SIT withdrawal penalties, until Cindy called Joann on 3/10 around 4:30 pm to 
tell Joann we had incurred several days of penalties. Joann asked Cindy which 
days, since we had already fixed the days we knew about SIT withdrawal 
penalties. Cindy told Joann about days 4,5,6,9,11,12,13, and 14. Joann faxed 
the proof for day 2/9/2000. Joann asked Cindy if she could do the retro's for 
the other days because we had plenty of Broadrun gas going to our pool. Cindy 
told Joann that she would have to run it past Steve, to waive the other days 
penalties.

TCO's philosophy has been vary accommodating to its shippers in the past. 
Judy had always told Joann and I, if CES/Enron made a good faith effort to 
keep SIT to a minimum, the penalties will not be charged. Enron feels it made 
a good faith effort to minimize SIT withdrawals in February 2000, and would 
like the SIT withdrawal penalties to be waived.

In addition, Enron has a win/win request for our Customer ServiceTeam. TCO's 
penalty philosophy appears to be changing and will not be as accommodating as 
it was in the past. Enron would like our Customer Service Team's assistance 
during the month to identify potential penalty situations. This will 
alleviate disagreements between TCO and Enron at the end of the month.

Before I send the this to Jeanne Adkins and Tom Brasselle, I'm running this

My flight is early Saturday morning... September 2nd. I should be home by
10
am. I leave late Monday night, 7 pm. I'll just catch a cab at the airport
on
September 2nd and will probably leave my car at the airport on September
4th.

Thanks again for everyone looking after my cat. If the sale of my condo
goes
as plan... I probably be back in Houston the following weekend to pack and
ship my stuff to Maryland. As these plans materialize, I'll let you know.

Alma, please continue to park in my space. I know you will have a rough
couple of months with your foot surgery. I'll just use your spot when I'm
home.

Thanks for everything... I'm so excited to come home!!!

We borrowed (deal227922) about 22,000 dt from CNG for the 28th and we will 
pay it back (deal 227926) on the 29th.  ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the daily 
balance on the 28th.  This gets confusing because we already have a parking 
deal from the weekend that comes out in April.

The portfolio we have created is "East - Service Deals - No Contract" and can 
be opened up in Deal Manager to view the storage deals on the East desk that 
have no contract.  Since we just created the porftolio, you will have to 
click on the blue refresh arrow icon located in the Open dialogue box in Deal

the one we just created.  If you have any questions, please call me at x35423.

As you are painfully aware, starting October 1 several of the CES / New Power 
utilities will be going to daily requirements.  Therefore, for those of you 
that handle the upstream scheduling for city gate deliveries to New Power 
please provide us with the pipelines you schedule, your pager number and that 
of your designated back-up, if applicable.  Additionally, anytime you know 
that you'll be unavailable please advise us who to contact in your absence.

Our plan is to send e-mails each weekday morning directly to schedulers that 
have changes ... and then follow up with a Daily Requirements summary (which 
several of you have indicated you do not need to see a copy of).  If you 
would prefer a phone call instead of or in addition to the e-mail on mornings 
that we have changes on your pipelines, please advise.  Please notify us via 
e-mail anytime you have a contract change that affects us (during the week) 
and page us on the weekends.

Thanks for your help.

fyi....this is how EnronOnline deals with non-performance issues will be 
handled (see below).
Please discuss with your traders/desk heads, as Bob Superty suggested, to 
ensure there aren't any issues with this.
Thanks for your cooperation.

Subject: Re: Sitara Deal 377626

Please read Jennifer's note below and let me know how you are currently 
dealing with EOL deals that have flow outside the original range of the deal. 
The way the Central desk is handling it is the way we want to across all 
desks. Basically, the original Sitara deal is adjusted to add the additional 
day/days that are agreed to by the traders and the counterparty to meet the 
full commitment and comments need to be added to reflect the same. 

Jennifer, I suggest letting all involved know that this is the way these will 
be handled (traders, desk heads, risk etc.) to ensure the consistency you 
mention is achieved. As you can see I'm only reaching a limited audience.

George, thanks for your explanation.

I reviewed the transaction in EnronOnline (#385131) & Sitara (#377626) and 
found similar treatment in the following deals for the month of August on the 
Central Desk.

Sitara #   EOL#
-----------   -------------
365957   363168
366026   363271
377650   385194 
369869   370402

I agree with the way George & his group are handling these non-performance 
and payback transactions as far as keeping them 
"connected". However, I think it is beneficial to put comments in Sitara as 
to what is happenning. As we know,  all EnronOnline deals are FIRM. If trader 
agees how to handle this on the phone, it is recorded plus it is documented 
in Sitara. I think this is a good audit trail and good record-keeping.  

Everyday, Elizabeth is doing a reconciliation that identifies any changes to 
EnronOnline transactions. If she read the comments
documenting as above, this "alarm" would be eliminated. 

Since we have not seen this on other desks, I wonder how they are handling 
non-performances. I think there should consistency
in the downstream systems. Bob, can you find out how East, West, and Texas do 
this?   

Thanks for your help.
Jennifer

Subject: Re: Sitara Deal 377626  

These deals are not being "retraded". These are instances where the 
counterparty has not performed and trading has made the decision to allow 
payback.
The only way we have to schedule that payback is to add an additional day to 
the deal. We could create a new ticket but I think this would create a 
"disconnect" between the EOL deal and the payback deal. I would appreciate 
your thoughts as to how we handle this in future.

Angie, this is not anything to worry about right now.  When you estimate your 
flowing volumes for May, you need to decrease the total volume at Hastings by 
3000 dth.  I will try to remind you.  

Kim, please send me an AMTEL at 1:00pm on 4/24/2000  "REMIND ANGIE TO REDUCE 
HASTINGS BY 3,000 FOR MAY"

that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For 
volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me

I think I see whats happening.  I believe deal 372088 is a bookout with deals 
229344 and 229357.  Should it also be a bookout with deal 227882?

What about deals 169036and 217764?

Jerry and I went to East Texas this weekend.  we withdrew $750.00 from the 
Fredonia bank and I'm going to deposit that in the Credit Union.  I also took 
the petty funds in the kitchen drawer - $72.00.

AND we did get $2,000.00 deposited into Dad's account from the Credit Union.

I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for 
June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in 
the end of the month.

On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth.
On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.

This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000.

The term is March through Oct.
For March, you use K# 910076
For Apr-Oct, you use K# 910077

The demand is .03,  the ACA is .0022 and the commodity and fuel is
different depending on what zone you use.

If you use STX to M3, the commodity is .0623,  ETX or ELA  to M3, the
commodity is .0570, and the commodity WLA to M3, the commodity is .0586.
 let me know what else you need????

Hi Chris,

I was hoping you'd be available via email today.  This is a test for now.

If this does get through to you, I want to purchase an additional 300 each for
the Nimo East pool and NIMO West pool.  I need the gas.

Thanks

We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:

DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of 
customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the 
imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a 
new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities 
that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.

Real forcast on 12/31 AM.

 We have bought 14,824 at PEPL/Maumee (A3) from EES on K#1300, to be used 
where "Toledo Agg" is noted. Per TCO, we should be fine on all those noms.

We have also bought 1,285 from EES at A06 on K#53858 for COH 8-35 and 8-39. 
This 1,285 includes the 250 we have been buying for Nov & Dec, but is in 
addition to the 1,089 for CPA. So total from EES at A06 for CPA/COH for Jan; 
2,374/d.

Yes, the producer receives a fixed price, however, these deals are probably 
in TAGG as Nymex plus basis deals.  Phillips deal was transferred to ENA, 
Power Gas was triggered on ENA books.
Or does it matter???

I know you all get sick and tired of people asking you for fund-raising 
money, so I promise this will be the only time for me.  (Hopefully it's less 
intrusive for you if I ask by e-mail instead of person to person)

 My son's school is participating in the Texas Marathon, which is a 
fundraiser held at private schools across the state, where 100% of the 
proceeds go directly to the schools.   This year is an especially important 
one for our school because our building needs a new roof---$50,000!   Anyway, 
the kids have to solicit sponsors and they have a special Texas Marathon day 
at school where they walk, together with parents, pets, brothers, sisters and 
teachers, to benefit their schools.  I would really appreciate if you could 
donate to the cause.  With the Enron matching program, it really makes a 
difference!  His school is very small, they keep the tuition low, and they 
teach the old-fashioned way, including Christian values.  I really want to 
support the school and keep it going.  

If you can give anything, please let me know via e-mail and I'll come by and 
collect the check, or you can just drop it by my desk.  The checks should be 
made payable to Carden-Jackson School.  I need to finish the collections by 
October 17 so I can get the matching forms into Enron

Thanks for your help!

ENA pays 89.17% of the demand  and commodity charges and 100% of the fuel.  
Now we pay the pipelines 100% and Boston Gas reimburses us the difference.  
Our Canadian producer group is charged the whole 89.17% of the transportation 
charges and all of the fuel in their netback pricing.

Hope this answers your question...

Per my voicemail message to John.

I talked to Stacy Miller at TCO to better understand the SIT limitations.

TCO has something called TFE (Total Firm ???). Plants can burn up to this 
amount and plus 1.03%.

Allied has the following FTS capacity;

39095 50075
62672 3333

Total 53408
 x 1.03

Total allowed without penalty 55,010

Stacy, Cindy, Steve please verify this amount.

If Allied burns above this amount then they will be subject to penatly, even 
if SIT withdrawal is allowed. TCO has started to enforce this penatly again.

Stacy did say that we could true-up the next day to avoid the penatly, like 
we do for the Cogen's. However, you still need capacity above 55,010 to meet 
the burns. That is why Cindy was letting Allied use its SIT withdrawal and 
Aristech's contract. Unfortunately, this was cut by TCO by about 50%.

Not sure what you want to do John. You are welcome to talk to Chris and Scott 
about using Enron's Capacity... but ours is maxed out for the Cogen's in that 
area. International Paper may have some idle capacity, you would have to talk 
to Amy at Alliance 502-426-4500 x7372.

This brings up another question. When will Allied be transferred to another 
fuel manager?? Lee Tippet said it would be effective April 1st. If it is not 
April 1st, Allied needs to sign the piece of paper to allow Enron access to 
perform Allied's nominations. If Allied still refuses this to do it, you will 
need someone at CES to perform these nominations. I will not have access to 
my CES account on April 1st to do Allied's nominations.

Thanks for your patience and understanding.

Thanks to the help of Terry Franklin and Dominion Transmission, all our CES 
and CEM appalachian pools will now be combined into ENA pools beginning June 
1.  Hopefully this should help to alleviate some confusion and hassle for 
everyone.   -AZ

To ensure we are all on the same page, this is the order to fill Choice for 
high burn days:

67693 =  54327  (note... we have some CES EU on this contract... about 1000 
to 1500 dkt)

67829 = 8527 (Aristech's capacity, seq 1 = coh 7-1 and seq 2 = coh 7-5)

67831 = 3473 (Aristech's capacity, seq 1 = coh 7-1 and seq 2 = coh 7-5)

67830 = 3000  (Aristech's capacity, seq 1 = coh 7-1 and seq 2 = coh 7-5)

We don't need to make it up b/c it's daily balancing.

Thanks,

I think we need to get scheduling, volume management, and accounting together 
somehow.  I don't think a happy hour would do it because people tend to get 
in their groups and talk.

Let me know what you guys think.  I would like to talk to Bob Hall and Bob 
Supperty about this,.

Subject: CES Storage

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

I just adjusted the November Market East demand charge from $1,233,260 to 
$1,194,758.  This is on deal 508891.  Would you please send out an adjustment

Hi gang.  A few updates from last month.

Purchase from Statoil (deal 226563) behind CPA.  The volume is 1,500 dth per 
day.  I changed the end date from 9/30/2000 to 10/31/2000.  David, please 
check the risk assignment.

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Subject: Local Production for June

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

Subject: CES Daily March Requirements for 3/31, 4/1 thru 4/3


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   3/31 thru 4/3
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains 
the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Brian, we have  a deal we can't identify.  Do you show anything in your 
records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st?  It looks like a 1 
day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio.  The delivery 
point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong.  The price would be 
somewhere around $16.00.

We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we 
are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is 
paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.

Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the 
weekend and they are a little long.  Clarissa will let you know.

nomming those 3 contracts that are being cut, though.

I just updated the volumes on deals 523444 and 523459 for the 12th.  This is 
a bookout.  The volumes on these deals should always match, if they don't

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas 
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I 
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR 
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone 
know the deal tickets by the end of the day.

I talked with Chris G a little while ago---Two important items to note:

* He will be working on the rest of the CES business on Saturday and should 
be ready for us to bill out on Monday.

* On the manual invoice that was sent this past week.... CGAS was actually 
netted (the net of Sales and Purchase for this pipe only) so we need to find 
out what the real sales and purchase prices are when it's time to fix it in 
Unify (Chris, this one's a heads up for you when we see you for clean ups).

Ok....c'est tout.

I just spoke with CES.  CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June 
since June is the last month.   Please call me when you get a chance to 
discuss everything.

I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES.  I want to talk to Scott about 
that tomorrow.

No home yet. May have to take to Penn Fuel.  I left a message with Equitable 
to see if they are interested in Peoples, EOG, Equitrans and Penn Fuel.
What are you going to do with the CPA.  Bary Vanderhorst w/EES might be 
interested.  If not I wll contact Equitable.

I will contact Dominion to see if they are interested in any of this gas.

This is the true amount that Enron is buying back from Allied.

mainline to leach to allied = 12809/12426/12163
tco pool to allied  = 2898/2837

Total delivery cut  = 12163+2837 = 15,000
Total at pool  = 12426+2898 = 15,324

By golly.... the 15,000 grossed up is 15,324. Chris, thinking you want the 
15,324 on the ticket for the 5 days. John ... do you agree too?!?!  The deal 
ticket is 225366.

In case anyone cares.... did the SIT withdrawal nom's to Allied Plant on the

burns for Allied.

39095/84 was = 0  now = 12163

John, per voicemail. Reduced deliveries to Allied Plant by 90,000 or

39095/124  was = 12809/12426/12163 now = 0  (super nom from mainline pool to 
Allied plant)
37862/14  was = 0    now = 12809/12426 (mainline to leach)
37147/2478 was = 0   now = 12426/12426 (leach to TCO)
62672/12  was = 3405/3333  now = 507/496 (TCO agg to Allied plant)

Total reduced to Allied Plant:

39095/14  12163 reduction
62672/12  2837  reduction

Total  15,000 reduction

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better 
winter riding gear.

We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.  All we are doing is 
verifying Dad's signature on the will.  Once the judge sees us it should only 
take about five minutes.

That's all I have for now.

Subject: Terry Franklin-Appalachian Coordinator

I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the 
Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian 
Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron 
experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team.

In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following:

? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters
? Create purchase deals in SITARA
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc.
? Review calc sheets
? Maintain purchase pricing
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co

Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the 
commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner 
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume 
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very 
important area.   

Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to 
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current 
workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we 
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during 
this transition time.

Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!

I wish I could write such sweet words.  There are starting to be way to many 
Driscoll's, I think there was a Mark and Mike that I came close to sending 
this to.



  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
  and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
  Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 

  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
  From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say. 

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
  "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth. 

  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
  Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 

  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
  More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

New Virus Taking Offices By Storm
  This virus warning is genuine.

There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort
of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a
colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.

This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have
been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their
social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you
do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to
purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough
of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically
forget the "work".

If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and
drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to
the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum
punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work"
will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the
greatest cartoon ever.

Brian,

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking
contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking 
capability
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system.
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk
Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload 
withdrawal
during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the
contracts which is 2/29/2000.

2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES
retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.  I would work with 
Ed
McMichael's group who should be getting this schedule from CES Retail.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??






thanks

will be phased in by 11/1/04.
The first phase will start construction in 4/01 and involves looping 30 miles 
of pipe in Pennsylvannia and 30 miles of pipe in New Jersey at a cost of $123 
MM. The second phase will cost $119 MM.  I will let you know the primary 
delivery points of the shipper's capacity when I see the filing.

Chris-

What about Transco Zone 3?

Hey, I'm coming by with a picture of Natasha for you.

It's a huge long-shot, of course, a shot in the dark, but, hey- what the 
hell. The hardest thing about meeting her would be her getting a visa to come 
here. They're almost unavailable except for family members of US citizens. 
And, you'd be uncomfortable travelling there without an "escort," so to 
speak, because you don't speak Russian.

Yo buddy!!  I do have a worksheet but I still need to go through CES 
officially.  Let me chat with Doug Kinney.  I think it will be ok.  I also 
told Doug that my worksheet was probably easier to use when looking at total 
by Pipeline.  Get back with you soon.

Chris,

How the hell are you?

Hope all is well.

I was wondering if you could forward to me a list of all of the pipeline 
capacity and storage assets that you have on behalf of CES.  I am in the 
process of setting up New Power on the respective pipes.

Credit is an issue.  To better know how much credit NPC needs, I thought it 
would be good to see how much FT CES gets on each pipe.
  
Do you maintain a spreadsheet similar to the one you used to maintain for 
EES' assets?

Can you tell what I have?  Make sense?

Thanks.
Mike

Subject: Updated CES Jun'00 FOM Requirements


The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/26/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled "Comments".   The only changes
versus Friday's transmittal are to AGL volumes delivered on Transco.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

Subject: Re: CNG/Peoples Natural Gas  

Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from 
Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I 
may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables 
are netting to 0.

For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match 
the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment 
to Clinton.

Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually 
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I 
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes 
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to 
make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these 
deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money!

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

Kimat, It looks like we have some deals booked twice.  Take a look at my 
worksheet.  All volumes are monthly, positive is supply, negative is a sale.  
Also, I believe deals 231667 and 226703 should be moved to New Power.

What about deal 202939?  Normally, I move this deal to CGAS and its very 
confusing the way I do it.

Per the sales reps and GMS I will need the following:


100 dth per day to meter # 020030
596 dth per day to meter # 020028

I will receive a final number for these next week but this is an estimate.
(should not be that far off).

I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage true 
up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via 
interoffice to Jeff.

There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably 
be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.

How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his 
understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.

Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

My only suggestion are as follows:
(1)  We need to be more explicit about the de-coupling of the assets from the 
gas that is delivered to CES by ENA.  As such, I would recommend that we 
expand Sections 4.1 and 4.2  to include a CES paper pool storage or bank 
which gets credits (theoretical injections) and debits (theoretical 
withdrawals).  The credits to the bank would be made in accordance with the 
"Theoretical Storage Injection Schedule (TSIS)" as per 4.2 and Exhibit 2.  
The debits to the bank would be made per the daily CES nominations on days 
when the retail demand is greater than the daily purchase quantity defined on 
Exhibit 1.  The one exception to this de-coupling is that all of the 
debits/credits would be subject to operational constraints imposed by the Gas 
Storage Contracts and the Gas Transportation Contracts.  The constraints 
should only come into play with the debits, as the TSIS (which by definition 
will be less than the daily MDIQ) would rarely be impacted by constraints.  
At the end of the term, the bank balance and the physical storage balance 
will need to be equal.  If not, provision needs to be made for a post term 
true-up.

(2)  In the last sentence of Section 4.1, should the remedy for CES's failure 
to notify in a timely manner be "penalties" or "ENA damages," which would 
include both penalties and trading losses &/or opportunity costs?  I am not 
certain, but I understood it to be the latter.

  Per Jeff Hodge.

Here is an initial draft of an Agreement to finalize the retail issues.  
Please note that I have not included anything on gas buy back yet.  I would 
like to get some confirmation on that issue before drafting.

Otherwise, your thoughts and comments will be appreciated.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.

In anticipation of re-opening, you have an opportunity to pre-select your new 
locker location.  All active Body Shop members who had a permanent locker at 
the time of the September 1st construction close have been given first 
consideration when selecting their new locker location before December 29th.  
 Priority will be given to member's original locker location (i.e. a member 
who requests their original locker area will be given priority for that 
space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm. 



Follow these simple steps to secure your locker location:
Open and review the attached Men's Locker Design template.
Select your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice location preference.
Complete the Locker Selection Request Form.  
Complete and Sign the Locker Payroll Deduction Form.
Return all completed forms before December 29th to the Body Shop at EB1355, 
drop off at our offices on EB1372 or at the Body Shop Table in the lobby from

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Let's meet at Sullivan's just inside the 610 West loop on Westheimer at 7 PM  
because
a) It's central to the 3 Enron parties going on that night.
b) Matt and I haven't been kicked out of that place yet.
c) I can make fun of the people that are older than even me..
See you Saturday

I just spoke with John Hodge about Dayton's PEPL storage (see items in BLUE 
below).  According to John, CES was not able to utilize the PEPL storage 
volumes.  
Hunter, someone on your desk needs to speak with Marke Breese and John Hodge 
about the Dayton Storage.

NOTICE: COH OFO/OMO

Date Issued: December 11, 2000 

As a result of returning cold weather and significant under-deliveries by 
shippers on the Columbia Gas of Ohio (COH) system, COH is calling an 
Operational Flow Order and an Operational Matching Order (OMO) for all COH 
Gas Transportation Customers. The OFO/OMO is effective on gas day December 
13, 2000 and will remain in effect until further notice. If conditions 
warrant, these orders will be lifted to reflect the changing conditions and 
COH will advise you of such changes. Customer and marketer banks are not 
available during the OFO/OMO period. 

This notice is applicable to the Customer Choice program. CHOICE deliveries 
should always equal the customers demand curve. The OFO requires the same 
level of delivery, but the tariff provides for additional costs for failure 
to comply.

Customers with daily measurement devices are subject to the OMO. Those 
customers or their shippers are directed to adjust the customer's consumption 
and/or their deliveries to COH so that their deliveries to COH are equal to 
the customer's actual consumption.

Customers without daily measurement devices are subject to the OFO. Those 
customers are hereby directed to adjust their daily scheduled deliveries to 
COH so that those deliveries are equal to 60% of the customer's maximum daily 
volume as specified in the customer's gas transportation contract with COH.

Those customers or their shippers who fail to comply with this OFO/OMO shall 
be subject to penalties for the difference as provided for in COH's tariff. 
COH will continue to monitor weather conditions and demand, in order to 
remove the OFO/OMO as soon as possible.

If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact your Columbia Gas 
Representative.

I made a few small changes to the storage balances on CGAS.  I had to create 
a new deal ticket starting Sep 1st because the name changed from CES to "The 
New Power Company".

Joanne,  I made a change to Aug 31st.

Kyle, I think you need to change tagg.  

Let me know if anyone has questions.

Singer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Re: storage clarification & issues  

Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2:  The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month 
changes does appear to be an issue.  Since the contract didn't spell out in 
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we 
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly 
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.  I know Chris 
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not 
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.  I will ask that he forward 
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.  Let me know if 
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3.  Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms 
here.   Here is what is happening:  Your people are nominating this 
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), 
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.  That 
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are 
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between 
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual 
contract prices with the producers.  So, this is one issue we will have to 
address as indemnification items.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that I 
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all 
the nominations.  We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is 
what you want).  For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the 
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from 
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll 
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4.  Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like 
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the 
pipeline invoices on to you.  Maybe we should change this process to one 
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his 
confirmation and review of all the charges.  This means you may see quite a 
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.  Let us know what 
you would prefer.  Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that 
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to 
your office yesterday, March 29.  Chris will get all remaining demand charge 
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is 
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.  I apologize for the delay.

5.  Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a 
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on 
Monday.  Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you?  If not, please 
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory 
balances.

Subject: storage clarification & issues

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

Subject: Conversion of Gatherco Stations

Effective 04/1/2000, Columbia Gas Transmission will be transferring certain 
facilities to Gatherco, Inc.  There should have been a message in Columbia 
Navigator stating that there were certain meters that were going out of your 
IPP pool 37147 effective 4/2000.  The subject for this e-mail message was 
"Appalachian Meter Allocation".  The meters listed in this e-mail will now be 
on Gatherco's gathering lines and are going to be subject to the $.25 
gathering rate.  Per Dave Fusek at Gatherco, our final estimates for 04/2000 
SHOULD reflect these meters that were changed from Columbia Gas Transmission 
to Gatherco.  He said he is not 100% positive that they will get this 
finished in time, but they are hoping to have everything complete by the time 
they release our nominations.

Gloria and Wade,

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these 
meters.  Some of these meters were previously subject to Columbia's $.27 
gathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any 
gathering.  Again, these meters will now have a $.25 gathering charge.


Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heidi Griffith

I think we can change the ranks pretty easily.  As far as the business party 
Ids go, I think we need to have you, Diane and the Transco rep (Bharati?) 
discuss what needs to come across in the proprietary file.  Transco was 
making some changes on their side for the BUG stuff that we may not be taking 
advantage of.  We will see how the CES stuff fits in there as well.

Thanks, d.n.

Dave,

As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES 
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union.  Our proprietary file contacts the 
business party id, rather
than the DUNS number.  Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's 
business party id.  These
are the valid business parties we use:

ENA    5304
Brooklyn Union   21995 
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various 
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well.  For now, this is all we 
need.  In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert 
into Unify as do not
send??

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking.  We spend a 
great deal of time 
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to 
be cut as we need
it.  Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing 
activity to 899??

Thanks for you help.

Beverly

Willard Kinzer, via his wholly owned LDC Belfry Gas, has 142/day of firm 
transport available on 8/1/2000 for one year, which delivers into TCO.  He 
has released and sold this in the past, as he has his own supply that he uses 
to feed his Belfry Gas market.  (Kinzer is the largest independent producer 
in Kentucky, with about 18,000/day).

His agent, Milton Beattie, would like to know if we want to bid on this small 
piece of firm transport.  He  can be reached at 1-606-679-8812.

Call me or him if interested, and either way, please let me know.

Scott, Chris and Dan,

Attached you will find the contract minimum for Dayton capacity for January.

We did not have a basis trader over here so I had to guess at the numbers for
Jan.  You will see those listed in Red.

I'll update ASAP on Monday after visiting with Dayton and our trading staff.

That's ok.  I need to buy back  the gas CES is not taking.  I think that will 
be easier to do after the month is over.  I will calculate the volume and 
pricing in a worksheet and just enter a buy and a sale with CES on the last 
day of the month.

James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.  I 
don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.  

He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.  The demand charge and 
commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.  This is what we know about the 
contract:

MDQ = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000
The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and 
discounted demand of $6.08
If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61

What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for 
volumes over 4723 day.
What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November - 
 is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61.

We have end-users that get some type of discount for using Pennsylvania
production gas.  We usually supply these endusers with CNR (TETCO M2) gas or
Finnefrock (CNG N PT).  Finnefrock has been constrained (PL-l) so we have been
using CNR gas to supply them.

I'll be in this afternoon, so we can talk further if needed.

sorry, got Aug mixed up with Sep. Should be 786,579 dth for the month of Sep,
or 26,219.3/day. Chris, since it doesn't round evenly to a daily number, 
please
credit us for the monthly volume. That is why we were off by 26 dth ending
July.

Chris;
The 23,060/day volume is an annual imbalance true-up that we needed to buy 
from
CES and take physically.  We are not geared to market yet, so I baseloaded 
with
Dick.

Chris;
Have you received an answer on the the COH injection?  Jeff, please follow up.

Some questions about the 1st.

Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.  You are
showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.  AND I see a citygate load of 29,461
dt/day.

This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.  Is this to reduce 
the
citygate load or is this additional New Power supply?

Hi gang.  You guys may or may not be interested in this.  The files 
"febsaleinv1.xls" and "febsaleinv2.xls" are excel formats of ENA's invoice to 
CES for the month of Feb.  The "2000ces02.xls" file is where Goodell and I 
keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport 
pricing.  There is also a tab in this file called CGAS.  I use the data in 
this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS.  It is a completly manual 
process.

I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the 
pricing (excellent performance review stuff).  I do want to go over the data 
in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly.

Thanks.

Jeff, I believe the manual billing items are in the "febsaleinv2.xls" file.  
I will be out for the rest of the afternoon.  I will try to touch base with 
you later today.



Brian, all of the support for the billing is in the "2000ces02.xls" worksheet.

I changed the Oct 2000 volume on deal 203062 (tagg NA1167.8) from 95244 dth 
to 95246 dth.

Please make the following change:
Deal 203030 (NA1137.4)  change the volume for April from 50,857 dth to 13,527 
dth, and change the volume for May from 17,866 dth to 4,752 dth.

Please verify the following info;
The confirm for deal 169036 (NA0713.1) shows a price of $2.295 + $.6800, 
according to CES this should be a price of $2.795 + $.6800.  Please verify 
which price is correct.

The confirm for deal 168997 (NA0713.4) shows a basis price of $.455 for April 
and CES is showing $.175.  Please verify which price is correct.

We need to talk about issues surrounding assignment of CES assets.  I will 
need someone to champion things on your end.  Our deal is closing on 
7/31/00.  All activity related to August will accrue to New Power.  I.e. all 
Aug. hedges should settle with New Power.  All Aug invoices should be 
rendered to New Power.  We are assuming the Master Physical and Financial 
Swap agreements and the mass market portions of the Asset Assignment 
Agreement and related Gas purchase agreement and amendments as discussed.

We have had some discussion over things that we both want relative to the 
changeover but have not formalized anything.(monthly demand fee, honor 
storage and physical positions, BGE capacity control, right to seek other 
markets for pricing, etc.)  The most pertinent item should be having ENA 
quickly review and approve assignment of the master agreements.  Then we will 
need to be recognized as the holder of all underlying transactions. Can you 
run this charge?  Do you need a formal notice from CES on assignment? Have 
you received one yet?  Secondly, we probably need paper in place to formalize 
our position assuming the mass market portion of the agreements referenced 
above.  

I may be hard to get a hold of today, but would be available first thing 
Monday morning to discuss.  Let me know what's available on your schedule.  
Thanks

Okay... to ensure we are all on the same page. I've talked to Jill 
Linkenauger and Heidi Griffith... and the following will be done.

Jill has forwarded to Heidi the CNR file for CES customers and their 
addresses. Jill also forwarded the appropriate form that needs to be sent to 
the producers, signed, and return to Enron.

Terry Franklin will be the Enron North America contact on the form for these 
CNR producers (Jill estimates about 50 CES producers). 

Later this week, Heidi will send the form to the CNR's CES customers. Heidi 
will put Terry's phone number and address on the form.

We will need the Appalachian Traders (John Singer, Jim Javins, Jill 
Linkenauger) to encourage the producers to sign this paper work and get it 
back to Enron ASAP. We want the change over done by April estimates.

Jill said if the change did not happen in time for April estimates, she would 
help send out the ascii file one more time. At the end of March, Jill will 
end her employment with CES... so we can't depend on her in the future months 
for this ascii file.

Thanks again for everyone's help in getting the change over done ASAP.

I called Jill Linkenauger Friday afternoon... haven't heard back. My plan is 
to talk to her and then Kevin McCracken at CNR to have this agency switch 
over by April 1st. I thought it was done... but not 100% sure.

Hey cats. Sylvia needs to know if we are agent for CES regarding CNR 
contracts. I began setting up the contracts on Friday, but she stopped me in 
the middle cuz she wants to make sure that we are setting them up correctly. 
I have 50 to 70 to set up. Please let me know what you know. - Thanks, Rob

For the Ohio gas, we should be pulling any additional volume out of our Bank
and we will bill first of month, any thing we dont burn should be put into our
bank, MME will have to buy the bank at the end of the month anyway.

For the other Major account areas unless it is a major adjustment, I was
assuming gas daily plus transport + premium

My CES buddy is starting to focus on local production now.  What's bad is CES 
has seen some of the pricing for the local production, I was going to bill 
them a lot more for it.  That does not mean they agree to the pricing.

Comments, questions??  Will this cause any problems with the Choice program

Sylvia - I have received the invoices for the direct meters for 01/00 for CNG
for CES and CEM, but the contracts are not in path manager and I can't pull
them up in Global contracts.  Can you take care of this?  Let me know if I
need to send this to someone else, also, let me know if you need anything
from me.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

FYI.  I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating 
that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For 
volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me 
know if anyone wants a copy of the letter.

Thanks,

Call me when you get a chance.  There is some new capacity to execute for 
November.  Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown 
in yellow.  Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.  I 
won't execute these until I hear from you.











The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.  Scott said Jeff 
gave us the OK on this one.

Subject: CES Daily for Aug'00 Requirements for 8/1/00 and after


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 8/1and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day 
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 
for the month.  

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will 
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. 

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly 
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Subject: PNG Local Production July 00


Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

A quick summary of the Dominion Transmission Pool Operators Meeting:

1.  Two Pooling/Aggregations points:
  Appalachian Northpointe( Finnefrock & Misc) 
  Appalachian Southpointe (Bridgeport, Cornwell, Hastings & Misc)
2.  Two pool types:
   Transmission pool when the gas is delivered into a transmission line;
   Gathering pool when gas is delivered into gathering line.
3.  Pool operatores can do pool-to-pool tranfers between Transmission pools 
or between Gathering pools.  NO pool-to-pool transfers between a Transmission 
pool and a Gathering pool. 
4.  Pool-to-pool transfers will be allowed between North and South Points.  A 
transportation fee will be incurred. 
5..  Seperate agreements for Gathering (pooling & transport) and Transmission 
(pooling & transport) are needed.
6.. MARQ disappears Jan 1,2000.
7.  New "PROPOSED" gathering/extraction rates are:
 Gathering: $.3726 .
 Extraction:  $.3261.
 Fuel remains @ 2.28%
(IOGA WV is attempting to force Dominion into lowering these rates)
8.  Nominations for flowing gas moved back one business day.
9.  Appalachian Notices will be posted at www.dom.com

 I will bring the handouts with me  Bid week.  
John

We are agent for Enterprise, Petsec, and Pennzoil (Devon) on Stingray.  Petsec
and Pennzoil (Devon) are filling out the appropriate forms and should send to
you for your signature today.  There in nobody at Enterprise to sign the
form.   I am still working with Stingray regarding the agency between Enron 
and
CES.  I thought this was taken care of but maybe not.  I am working with a
backup that is confusing.  I will follow up.  In summary, I think Enron will
have to nominate on CES contracts because I do not feel all this will get done
today.  Especially, Enterprise Oil.

NEWS FLASH!!!!

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a 
nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not 
based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it 
could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. Finding 
enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem.

Just got this clarified by Scott G., that this is not a special pricing but
like any other contract. ENA will bill CES for both demand and commodity
charges, ENA is billed by TCO for $0.01 demand and commodity and Aristech pays
TCO the remaining demand.

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any
commodity costs. Thanks JPP

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial
holiday" for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.


Contract Changes:

7-1: 67693     11558

Subject: Equitabel Gas Company Exchange on Tetco

CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas 
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is 
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new 
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the 
January transaction is complete.

Here are my questions/comments;

1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.  
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.  
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the 
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.

2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to 
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment 
was due.

3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it 
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?

4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES 
deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who 
should he talk to about that??


Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

Thanks

I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas, K#T016336, AND the OLD total for 
Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442.

We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES.  For now, I'm 
taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000

That's all for now.

I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new 
demand charges.  The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not 
subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424.

Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you 
eliminate segmenting.

Example #1

Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary 
delivery point of PECO in Z6.
What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day 
of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios;

PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from 
Tetco/Ragley to Z6?

PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65, and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to 
Z6?


Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity.

Enron schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?

There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the 
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of 
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.  
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Thanks

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

Here are the January daily volumes for each of the gates.    This is the

and
we will know that on Thursday.   The number on the attached spreadsheet is our
estimate of what Boston Gas and S.Ct. should be.    We will fine tune those 
two
ldc's on Thursday.    For the month of January we will need a range from 3200
dth to 4300 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of
markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

This transaction involves 5 contracts.  Nat Fuel is billing ENA a total of 
($.125 x 1,000,000 dth) or $41,666.67/month for 3 months.  I don't think Nat 
Fuel knows how we will be billed yet so I am going to show this as a demand 
charge on contract A02353 until we figure it out.

Subject: New and Exciting National Fuel Deal


We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

I have revised Exhibit 1 of the retail supply agreement pursuant to our 
meeting
last week. Two changes were made:

 1)  Tennessee Zone 6 premium for 1/2000 was corrected to +.06.
 2) Volume requirements for Choice programs with storage were
reduced in most cases to account for storage gas being withdrawn. These are 
the
final volumes.

Actually, the deal is for 773/day @ into CPA via the Carnegie-Jefferson 
interconnect.  The price is NX1 + $0.12/Dth; the contract expires 11/01/00.
 This gas only flowed for a part of February and is not flowing for  March.  
CPA closed the interconnect with Carnegie for their own needs/system supply.
This gas may not flow for the rest of the contract.  CPA will only operate 
the interconnect on a day-to-day basis; no firm is available.  I am to check 
with CPA to see if they will do an exchange for this gas.

Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG 
Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61.  
The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell 
him.


I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport).

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.

What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on 
Feb 23rd?  I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.  MDQ = 5000 and the 
rate is $.01?  Who did this deal?

The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery 
point is Rayne.  It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.  I'm 
setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I 
entered it in Sitara deal 223022.

Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify.

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers.  The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume 
of
the increase.  That is an estimate.  Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.

The attached file contains updated July 2000 volume requirements for CES.  The
changes relative to the original request sent on 6/23/00.   Changes are
described on the worksheet labelled 'Comments' under the date 06/26/00.   The
only other change that I currently anticipate is to NIPSCO when they post our
July requirements on their EBB.

Please call me if you have questions, etc.

Chris--So as not to delay things more than I already have, the table below
shows our March '00 Requirements on AGL by pipeline.  I will put these values
into the spreadsheet that I sent earlier, but this will give you an idea of
what the numbers look like.



The above values for storage withdrawals assume that we are maximizing the
withdrawals from the so-called "Directly Assigned Storage" that ENA schedules
on our behalf.  I believe that notwithstanding the above storage withdrawal
values, we will still have storage inventory left at the end of March since 
our
withdrawals to date have been so low.   Both the Storage withdrawals shown
above and the Flowing gas should flow on Primary firm capacity since we have
been assigned this capacity by AGL.    The above numbers also assume that we
will be maximizing our withdrawals of AGL's IBSS (Incremental Bundled Storage
Service) during March.  The IBSS withdrawals are not  included in the storage
withdrawal volumes shown above, since we schedule the IBSS ourselves at AGL's
citygate.

Please call me if you have questions and I will be forwarding you a final copy
of the spreadsheet with these numbers in a short while.

Sorry for the delay!

I show the following 12 "fixed price" deals between ENA and CES that were 
assigned to New Power.  Negative dollar amounts based on the volumes of the 
1st 3 shown below were on the August invoice ... which I interpreted to be 
where ENA was buying the gas back at Index.  I assumed all 12 deals should be 
similarly represented on the invoice.

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount 
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn. 
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES 
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. 
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. 
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage 
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what 
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling 
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any 
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the 
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES 
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES 
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to 
cause unnecessary pain.

Subject: CES FOM August 2000 Volume request


The attached file contains CES's first-of-the-month daily volume requirements
for August 2000.  This request is submitted 3 business days prior to NYMEX
close for the month of August.   The file contains volumes to be delivered to
the citygate as well as volumes to be injected into storage consistent with 
the
theoretical storage injection schedule.


Please note that for the month of August '00 CES is not purchasing additional
volumes of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate 
deal,
as was done in June and July.   Also, CES is not ordering any volumes in 
August
for Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal) which ceased to be a CES customer at 
the
end of March 2000.


Please call me if you have questions or problems with the attached request.

CDC could invoke $30 per dth penalty plus the tariff cost.   I will not know 
if
they will invoke this until after they close the month.

Subject: CKY 6-12 January 2000 - cut 29th 767 dth

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from 
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.   However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.   They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.     When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.   I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.   I 
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.   I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.   I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.    She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.   She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).   I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.   However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.   I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short,  we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).   Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.   
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville.  Lambertvile is in Tetco M3 
(in New Jersey).  This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on 
a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.  Lambertville on 
Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6.  

The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle.  
E Town
N Jersey
PSE&G
Con Ed
Lilco
Bug
Belle Mead (interconnect with Transco)
Hanover (interconnect with Algonquin)

Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville.  Also, deliveries to Algonquin 
at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint.

Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how 
much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville.

Meredith, when you get a chance, please confirm which points are downstream 
of Lambertiville.

Hi Joann and Alvin,

As you know, effective October 1, ENA became agent for Virginia Natural Gas.  
Here in Volume Management, as I try to load beginning balances and actualize 
volumes (so that I can pay VNG's transportation charges) for 10/2000, it 
appears that the following contracts for VNG/Cgas are not in Unify.

Contract Number  Type    
38079    FSS...Master Contract
35889    x-133 LNG Storage
60536    SST
37634    ISS
53004    FSS
60537    FSS

I would appreciate any help you can give me in getting these contracts in 
Unify as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Angel
