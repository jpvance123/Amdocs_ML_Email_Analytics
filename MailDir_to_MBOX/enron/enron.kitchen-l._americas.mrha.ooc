Page 37=20
Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.=20

Somewhere near 500 Internet-based exchanges for energy, oil, petrochemicals=
, and hydrocarbon shipping have been launched worldwide over the past two y=
ears. But most have since folded or been acquired. It's interesting to note=
 that virtually all of those exchanges--both the survivors and the deceased=
--have two things in common. -- They were created from scratch by entrepren=
eurs from the technology world, or from the industries their exchanges are =
(or were) intended to serve. -- The businessmen and women behind them have =
followed the same train of thought in concluding that on-line trading was a=
 business they could succeed at.=20

This train of thought can be broken down into four parts.

Premise 1: On-line trading is ``more efficient'' and will save its particip=
ants money.

Premise 2: I can capture some of those savings as site revenue.

Premise 3: My site will be the best site out there, so everyone will use it=
.

Premise 4: With all this liquidity, I can construct benchmarks. My benchmar=
ks will be unimpeachably scientific and replace the existing, unscientific =
benchmarks currently used by the industry. As a result, I will make even mo=
re money, because I will become an information provider.

This article will examine those premises and the limits of their inherent l=
ogic, with a view to showing why very few--if any--of the 500 launched exch=
anges will survive. In particular, it will show why the logic of Premise 4 =
is not valid for markets in physical commodities, such as oil and petrochem=
icals.

Premise 1: On-line trading is more efficient

Few would question that, in theory, electronic trading has the potential to=
 make liquid markets much more efficient. The history of EnronOnline, proba=
bly the most successful electronic energy trading system in the world today=
, supports that view. According to Enron, EnronOnline has succeeded in rais=
ing the number of transactions completed by each of its market makers from =
an average 672 in 1999 to 3,084 last year, while lowering the marginal cost=
 per transaction by 75% over the two-year period.

However, the markets that EnronOnline predominantly serves are two of the m=
ost liquid and homogeneous in the energy business: natural gas and electric=
ity. Moreover, the exchange has achieved its efficiency gains using a model=
 very different from any deployed by--or available to--most on-line exchang=
es. Essentially, Enron has used on-line trading to extend and complement it=
s existing, off-line trading business. Enron's focus remains the transactio=
n, rather than the transaction system.

By contrast, the majority of transaction platforms for physical commodities=
 are interlopers. Their operators assume that commodities traders are willi=
ng to depersonalize their business by having their complex transactions exe=
cuted not by humans, but by an electronic system that can do deals faster a=
nd more anonymously, and--at least in theory--with more players.

This assumption is a risky one, largely because it is based on a buyer's pe=
rception of how marketplaces should operate. It fails to take into account =
the concerns of physical commodity sellers and--more importantly--producers=
. Typically, producers wish to ensure that the uptake of their commodity is=
 continuous, because that minimizes the volatility of the commodity's price=
. Relationships become all-important under such conditions--but relationshi=
ps are hardly enhanced by electronic dealing. To quote the November/Decembe=
r 2000 issue of the Harvard Business Review, ``Few suppliers want to be ano=
nymous contestants in ruthless bidding wars.''

Premise 2: I can make money selling gains in efficiency

The logic underlying Premise 2 is potentially seriously flawed. For while t=
here is no doubt that market participants are prepared to pay for more effi=
cient services, such as electronic trading, the nature of the forces drivin=
g physical energy commodity markets casts doubt on whether a trading system=
 can, in the long term, make a profit by charging per-transaction fees.

Here's why: Although the era of competition is just beginning, it's clear t=
hat pressure on transaction fees is already downward, and will remain in th=
at direction even if the number of participants in an exchange shrinks to a=
 handful. In the energy business, the potential for efficiency gains--as a =
percentage of total industry cost--simply is not that great. For example, r=
esearch done for Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, New York,=
 indicates that the total potential efficiency ``pool'' in the oil industry=
 is only $150 million/year. Even if only 10 businesses were to try to carve=
 a profitable enterprise out of such a pool, each would be hard-pressed to =
do so.

What's more, such businesses would have an even harder time turning a profi=
t because some of their competitors wouldn't be using a per-trade revenue m=
odel. In particular, sites operated by market participants, such as EnronOn=
line, will tend to charge nothing per trade, because their business models =
seek to profit not from commissions on transactions, but rather from the tr=
ansactions themselves. By implication, it seems likely that an exchange wil=
l be able to make money only if its owners sell something else: clearing fa=
cilities, back-office integration, or information to decision-makers.

Premise 3: My site will be the best, so it will capture all the market liqu=
idity available

This statement--which essentially says that given enough marketing support,=
 a site can change the trading patterns of an industry to capture all of it=
s liquidity--is a fallacy.

The logical problem with the premise is clear. Because no one has yet devel=
oped a trading software package that is clearly superior to others, what ``=
best site'' really means is ``most liquid site.'' So the pre-condition for =
capturing ``all'' the liquidity is that the site must already be the most l=
iquid site.

Some startup exchanges have attempted to solve this problem by insisting th=
at their participants make volume guarantees. But volume guarantees conflic=
t directly with traders' focus on profits. Trading businesses that tell the=
ir traders to sacrifice profits for the sake of the common good are playing=
 a risky game; if the common good means lower trading profits, the traders =
will simply leave for greener pastures.

To become the ``best'' site, then, a site must somehow find a way to bootst=
rap its liquidity, perhaps by offering substantial, non-volume-related ince=
ntives or efficiencies to users.

However, the paradox is that most sites' revenue models depend almost exclu=
sively on volume.

Premise 4: Once I capture lots of liquidity, I can build benchmarks

This premise is the most startling and--in some ways--the most flawed of th=
e four. It raises many serious questions, the answers to any of which can i=
nvalidate the model. Worse, these questions are all highly theoretical, mak=
ing persuasive answers even harder to come by.

Among the questions are: -- How much liquidity is enough? -- Do indexes (vo=
lumetric averages) make good physical benchmarks? -- Can a trading site ben=
chmark with the bid/offer range? -- Can a trading site generate a close? An=
d, last but not least: What is a benchmark, anyway?

Benchmarks and indices

A benchmark is a price or series of prices that a market's participants agr=
ee to use as the basis for determining other prices. Useful benchmarks are =
good indicators of transactable value. A benchmark allows market participan=
ts to determine at what price they should buy or sell the commodity.

Benchmarks are typically used in complex markets with multi-dimensional var=
iables for arbitrage. In oil, for example, benchmark pricing has grown up a=
round the need to compute relative values for differing commodities across =
time, geographical distance, commodity type, and the degree to which one co=
mmodity may be substituted for another.

It is a common error, however, to believe that markets should or do use the=
ir most liquidly traded commodities as benchmarks. Although liquidity is a =
major asset of benchmarks, many markets use illiquid benchmarks whose other=
 characteristics outweigh the liquidity advantage. These include market tra=
nsparency; the free and open availability of the commodity; the absence of =
political or partisan control of the commodity; the absence of delivery res=
trictions on it; and the size of the end-user market where the commodity wi=
ll be consumed. For example, although the physical volume of Dubai crude oi=
l actually produced is tiny, it nonetheless is used as a key benchmark for =
all of Asia because--unlike its Persian Gulf competitors--it is the only cr=
ude oil that has these characteristics.

One way to compute a commodity's benchmark price is through strict indexati=
on, the process of constructing a price marker from a volumetric average of=
 concluded business. However, this process will have little chance of produ=
cing a useful benchmark unless the contributing volumes are high. If it doe=
sn't reflect a sufficient number of trades, an index has little or no stati=
stical validity as an indication of transactable price.

This represents a problem for benchmarking oil prices, whether for crude or=
 products. Of the 77 million barrels of crude produced worldwide each day, =
the vast majority are sold on the long-term contract market, leaving perhap=
s as little as 10% to be traded ``spot.'' In reality, this figure is booste=
d in multiple ways, primarily by transaction chaining--the repeated on-sell=
ing of cargos--but, even assuming threefold transaction growth as a result =
of electronic trading, is still perilously low to be used as a valid basis =
for strict indexation, especially considering the great diversity of crude =
oil specifications around the world. For many crude oils, the trading basis=
 for establishing price can be just a few transactions per month. Even for =
``liquid'' benchmark crudes, the basis is typically just a handful of trade=
s per day. Oil markets, however, don't seem to care. For example, the settl=
ement basis for the International Petroleum Exchange's Brent crude oil futu=
res contract is an index based on a smattering of
 physical trades taking place on the day of expiry. Acceptance of an indexa=
tion mechanism such as this has difficult prerequisites. These include open=
 participation in the mechanism, the perceived existence of a ``level playi=
ng field,'' the existence of comparative historical data, and achieving ``b=
uy in'' from the market's dominant players.

The nature of today's on-line exchanges makes these conditions hard to meet=
. Not everyone uses exchanges; they may be owned by industry players; they =
typically have little or no historical data; their daily volume fluctuates =
wildly; and major players' commitment to them is either fragmentary or comp=
romised by volume commitments. In today's environment, the chance that an i=
ndex will be able to gain market acceptance as a benchmark is extremely sli=
m.

Are strict volumetric indices useful? Another big question surrounding volu=
metric indices is how useful they are as benchmarks for physical commoditie=
s. Advocates of indexation argue that its statistical methodology helps eli=
minate market distortions caused, for example, by market closes. In additio=
n, they argue that the alternative approach--``market assessment,'' based o=
n human judgements about transactable prices--is too subjective to be relie=
d on to determine benchmark prices. Indexation, its proponents argue, ``eli=
minates'' this subjectivity.

In practice, however, this argument doesn't pass the ``so what?'' test. Eve=
n if a system such as indexation succeeds in taking judgement out of the de=
termination of market prices, it cannot prevent attempts to distort the ind=
ex by exploiting the ``rules'' on which the system is based.

In many markets, human judgement is the only effective defense against mark=
et plays whose goal is profit, not price transparency. Even in highly liqui=
d markets--such as, for example, the monthly natural gas market in the U.S.=
--the indices generated by information companies like Platts are subject to=
 human review and analysis. During their generation, Platts' market special=
ists undertake a string of comparative tests to unearth potential distortio=
ns in reported prices. Whenever such distortions become apparent, Platts' e=
ditors investigate the market further and, where necessary, eliminate certa=
in trades from the assessment picture. There are good reasons for their dil=
igence. A volumetric index can be manipulated by volume plays, by a few pla=
yers under the cloak of ``anonymous dealing,'' by selective trading, or by =
hedging in one marketplace and trading in another.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how players with exposure to a particular price =
on the buy side might--and actually do--manipulate a volumetric index. By d=
oing lots of business early in the day when the market is rising, they can =
skew the volumetric average for the day lower (Figure 1). When the market i=
s falling, they reverse the pattern and shift their transactions to late in=
 the day, again pushing the market down (Figure 2). When players do this co=
nsistently, the impact on an index can be considerable over time.

There are other, potentially more serious problems with indices. Because an=
 index is a theoretical construct, in a rapidly moving market it will manif=
est lag--and become useless to market participants seeking the answer to th=
e question, ``At what price should I buy or sell?'' Indeed, an index may ev=
en actively mislead people asking this question. For example, in a fast ris=
ing market, an index generated over the course of one day will be significa=
ntly below the opening market price on the following day. This creates the =
impression that prices have somehow moved overnight, whereas in fact they m=
ay not have moved at all.

But perhaps the biggest problem with indices relates to their use in heavil=
y interlinked markets, where prices are constrained by a complex of spread =
and arbitrage values. This description applies to most energy markets, and =
is particularly apt for today's global, physical market for oil. In markets=
 where spread relationships are as or more important than outright prices, =
the process of generating averaged indices tends to generate sets of prices=
 that cannot be reconciled with each other.

Figure 3 depicts a dramatized version of this problem. Price 1 and Price 2 =
are interdependent; here, there is always a 5 cents difference between them=
. However, the volume pattern for the day's trade (shown in the lower part =
of the figure) is such that while Price 1 has very high volume early in the=
 day, Price 2 does not enjoy its volume boost until later. The result: Cont=
rary to market reality, the volumetric averages for Price 1 and Price 2 say=
 that they only differ by 1 cents.

Other routes to price discovery

So, if an on-line trading system cannot generate a reliable benchmark from =
an index, are there other routes to price discovery? Yes, two. The first is=
 to benchmark from a bid-offer range, and the second is to use a close of s=
ome kind.

Bid-offer ranges are widely used as market measurement tools by Platts and =
others. However, the automated application of bid-offer ranges in pursuit o=
f ``scientific'' benchmarks is fraught with difficulty. What happens when t=
here is a bid, but no offer? An offer, but no bid? What rules can be writte=
n to discriminate between an ``off-market'' bid and an ``on-market'' one? H=
ow should a system decide when a bid or offer's timing is not representativ=
e of the typical market? Most on-line exchanges have not even begun to answ=
er these questions, and at best offer their users a ``last bid-last offer''=
 price range that can accidentally distort their perception of the market, =
if the two are not aligned in time, or if it turns out, for example, that t=
he ``last bid'' was actually withdrawn in response to the ``last offer.''

Some exchanges, implicitly acknowledging that creating useful benchmarks is=
 difficult, have tried to incorporate their transactions and bid/offers int=
o published benchmarks. Obviously, they hope that their system will attract=
 more liquidity if it is tied to a traditional benchmark. But it's safe to =
say that a publisher will be interested in incorporating an exchange's prop=
rietary markers only if transaction bid/offers are open and transparent.

Can an on-line site benchmark from a close? In theory, yes. But if human ha=
nds and brains intervene, the process is no longer a mechanical one, but ra=
ther an editorial/judgement effort. Here too, there are many obstacles. One=
 of the biggest is that closing prices work best in two kinds of markets: c=
ompletely ``open'' markets, in which assessments are derived by surveying a=
ll participants; and ``sole-operator'' markets--like futures markets--where=
 the traded instrument exists only on that exchange.

Physical commodities, by contrast, are traded across a broad spectrum of in=
struments and sub-markets. It would be virtually impossible for the owner o=
f a single sub-market--or on-line exchange--to assert the superiority of it=
s close over someone else's, or to build market acceptance for a price deri=
ved from a trading pool that doesn't include all players.

Even a system used by most players--for example, the oil industry's derivat=
ives-trading Intercontinental Exchange--would have a hard time convincing a=
nyone to rely exclusively on its closing prices. That's not only because ``=
most'' is not the same as ``all,'' but also because liquidity is frequently=
 too low to assure that there will in fact be a traded market to close ever=
y day. What happens to the benchmark on days when no one comes out to play?

In conclusion, it appears that price discovery may not necessarily be an em=
ergent property of on-line trading systems. That may be the case because th=
e creators of most on-line trading systems have confused its mechanism with=
 its function. Trading systems are neither new markets nor new marketplaces=
; they are simply new vehicles for participating in existing marketplaces. =
A telephone is also a vehicle for participating in markets--but no one expe=
cts their phone to be able to tell them the price of a commodity.=20

These are the events that took place concerning the New York Customer Holiday Event:

In order to reserve rooms for the first weekend in NY at the Four Seasons, I have to book no later than 9 months out.
To hold these rooms, a contract had to be signed and a $15,000 deposit sent.  The contract allowed us to cancel the entire event by the end of July with no penalty and the deposit was fully refundable.
In speaking with Dave Duran and Frank Vickers in May, they wanted to proceed with this event. ( Attached is a memo that I sent to Frank Vickers outlining the cancellation policy.)
The cost estimate went through several revisions and the final was sent to you for your approval in July.
After the approval form was rejected, I spoke with Dave Duran and he was planning to revise his guest list and re-submit the approval form.
I talked to both Frank and Dave numerous times and reminded them of the hotel penalty issues and had not heard back from either one until I received an e-mail on September 20th from Frank canceling his portion of the trip.
I called my Four Seasons national sales rep and she is working with NY in canceling the contract and minimizing the hotel liquidated damages.  I should have an answer from her no later than tomorrow.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this in more detail.
Thanks.

As I never approved this, I just wondered if the rumours were true that we did spend money on this trip.

Let me know

1. US is under attack.  We are in state of emergency.  Casualties are likely to be in the thousands. Two US "critical infrastructures"--transportation and finance--the cornerstones of the US economy have been severely damaged. 

2. Discount all gossip.  Responsibility will be put on many groups and many groups will claim responsibility.  There are no facts at this time.

3. Nonetheless, there are a limited number of terrorist groups that could coordinate an attack with this many targets and this level of sophisticaton.  Indeed, it is likely that a state sponsor of some kind would be required to provide financial and intelligence support for such an attack.

4. It is virtually certain that these groups or countries are based in the Middle East.  It is almost equally certain that a massive US response against a Middle Eastern target is forthcoming. There will be enormous domestic political pressure on the Bush Administration for a vengeance attack. This will be at least partially offset by a reluctance to further inflame Arab radicalism in the Middle East and Persian Gulf.

5. As mentioned above, in addition to the horrendous human cost, there are economic and market consequences:

Oil- IPE and NYMEX are closed.  Oil futures will of course react strongly to the dramatic uptick in Middle Eastern uncertainty.

Equities- General flight to quality.  Investors are selling equities and putting funds into cash.  Many major brokerages and trading firms have been wiped out in the WTC collapse. It will take some time--days or weeks--for these firms to restore operations.

Currencies- Swiss Franc and US dollar will benefit from flight to quality.

Shipping- major ports and border crossing closed, surrounding areas jammed with traffic.  Impact on all commodities--steel, lumber, pulp/paper, crude/products shipments, LNG, etc.  Ships at sea will back up, affecting pipeline deliveries.  Freight impacted by road chaos in major US cities.

Metals- gold/platinum benefit from flight to quality.

We will update as soon as we get information.

Hi Chris!

Thanks for the message and the great experience at Harvard last week!  Harvard's hospitality was the best!!

I'm travelling right now and only have a minute, but I've passed along your request to Louise and will follow up with her and the totality of your request on  Monday. ( I also told Louise she was a "star in absentia" at Harvard last week!!!)

Take care and we'll speak soon!

Best!

--Christie.

Subject:	Enron Online case


Christie:

Following up on my message of last week, I have now finished the minor
edits required to clarify the Enron Online case (correcting the stock
price, clarifying the "One to Many" versus "Many to Many" models of
trading, etc.).  The one piece that remains for me to insert is some
information that will allow the students to make some estimates about the
economic risk involved in this bold move.  I know that wholesale services
contributed about 89% of Enron's total profit in 1999, but it is unclear
what extent of this was provided by the traditional trading activities that
subsequently were enhanced by Enron Online. My suspicion is that it is the
majority of the sales volume, and perhaps the majority of profitability,
but if we could give some clue to that in the case, it would be
helpful.  This might simply be that "trading activities constituted the
majority of wholesale services profits" or "the vast majority" or "over
80%" or whatever you think would give the students some sense of
quantification.  The alternative might be to provide data that was
disguised and could be footnoted as such.  For example, we could identify
that trading contributed "over $750 million to Enron's net profits" with
that number footnoted as a disguised figure.

The other thing that would be very helpful would be again to provide some
data on the profitability of operations in 1999 versus the profitability in
2000 when Enron Online became a dominant part of its activities.  Once
again, we could include broad-level generalizations or disguised
data.  It's your choice, but it will give the students a sense of the size
of the issue facing them.

If it is helpful to talk about this in person, please feel free to call me
on 617-495-6308 today (Thursday); or tomorrow (Friday) in the afternoon at
802-457-1880.

Once again, thanks so much not only for the cooperation on the case, but
also for the terrific organization you did in getting your executive team
up here for last week's classes.  I think you probably realized that it was
a "home run" with the students, who are still talking about it.

Best wishes,
Chris

House Speaker Hastert has decided to close the entire Capitol complex,
including the office buildings on the House side, at the end of the working
day today through Monday, as a precautionary move to allow for special
agents and germ experts to conduct a sweep of the ventilation systems and
all remaining unopened mail. The Senate side is expected to do the same.

It has also been confirmed that the anthrax-laden letter sent to Senate
majority leader Daschle's office was of a particularly potent, high grade
military quality anthrax that quickly spread once opened. Some 29 staff in
Dachle's office or the mail room have tested positive, and some anthrax
spores were found in the ventilation system of the Hart building (where
Daschle's office is located) and in one of the tunnels leading to the
Capitol itself.

If there is even a hint that this military grade anthrax came from Iraq, there 
will be a strike by the U.S. against Iraq.  Another possibility is that the
anthrax is of Russian origin and was somehow illicitly acquired by Al Qaeda or 
the Taliban.

There has not been a second anthrax letter or a new outbreak of anthrax,
nor is there any evidence of anthrax spores spreading to committee rooms
located in the other Senate or House buildings. This was a pre-cautionary
move by House Speaker hastert, though it in no way diminishes how ugly the
situation is.

N.B.  Spoke with Koenig and we'll be chatting with Palmer tomorrow.  Koenig said he'll try and make it, but also thinks Palmer should be involved because of the Fortune angle.  Will fill you in later tomorrow.

Louise - Let me clarify a point I obviously mangled in my previous email.  We are going to change Gary's Drift allocation amounts to North America.  I talked to Mike about this yesterday and he agrees the current allocation is aggressive.  I need to talk to Gary on Thursday about these changes and if nothing else, give him a heads up that we are going to do this.  The costs allocated to you related to Drift will definitely be reduced and I will have the revised numbers for you on Thursday.  

Regards, 

Brent

Clearly this is an incorrect allocation.  Gary is allocating North America for 19 people for just managing drift.

It has now taken two months to get nowhere on this issue.

I revert back to Mike for resolution on this.

Subject:	RE: Drift

Louise - Current status on Drift expense allocations....  We have reviewed the $11.8 million in question and that amount is correct given the methodology being used by Gary to allocate costs.  When Gary is back in the office on Thursday, I will go through his allocations with him to determine if we need to change that methodology and thus change the allocation percentages.  I will let you know the outcome of that meeting.

Also, keep in mind that the $11.8 million represents a Plan amount.  Actuals should be much less since we are currently well under Plan headcount amounts and not all Plan expenses have been made.  Let me know if you have any questions - I will keep you updated.

Regards,

Brent

Brent, 

Mike and I have discussed the Drift plan and clearly there was an allocation issue somewhere along the line.  Please let us have our new numbers.

Thanks

EarningsVisibili ty Enhanced


Good Afternoon:

Attached, please find our recent FC note on Calpine.

 <<cpn071801.pdf>> 
Summary
1) We reiterate our Strong Buy rating on Calpine.  Over the last 2 days, the
company has announced a number of significant power sales agreements
associated with its Texas capacity.
2) On July 17, CPN announced that it had entered into 2 agreements with
Reliant Energy services to provide 1,000 MW of power over a 5 year period.
On July 18, CPN announced an agreement with Shell Oil to provide up to 3,000
MW of power, also over a 5 year period.  All the contracts commence on
January 1, 2002, which coincides with the beginning of retail competition in
Texas.
3) Other details relating to pricing and contract structure were not
disclosed.
4) In Texas, CPN currently owns 2,337 MW capacity in operation, 3,786 MW
under construction and 1,007 MW under development.
5) Importantly, as a result of these announcements and other recent
agreements, Calpine's Texas capacity is now 85% sold forward for the next 2
years.  Overall, this hedged position gives us additional comfort in CPN's
ability to meet or exceed our 2001-2003 EPS estimates of $1.94, $2.35 and
$3.08, respectively.
6) Some investors have expressed concern about Calpine's exposure to
potential overbuilding in the Texas market.  CPN's recent contract
announcements should reassure investors that the company is actively taking
steps to manage and minimize its market price risk in this region.  

Regards,

Last year, Enron employees generously donated a record $2.8 million to the United Way, an amount which exceeded our goal of $2.3 million by nearly half a million dollars.  This year we are setting our sights even higher with a goal of $2.9 million.  When matched dollar for dollar by Enron, our total contribution would be $5.8 million.

This goal is a challenging one, but we believe it is achievable with your help.  It is also a far-reaching goal with the United Way touching 1 out of every 2 lives in the greater Houston area.  

To kick-off this year's campaign, please join us for the EWS Leadership Giving Reception in the Bluebonnet Ballroom at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 1700 Smith St. on Tuesday, July 31 from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m.  The adopted agency for EWS this year is the Center for the Retarded.  Representatives from the center and recipients of Enron's United Way Scholars program will be there to share their experiences with you.  We will also review the campaign objectives for this year.

Given the fact that Enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and bonus programs, we invite you to help by joining us as a member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society with your generous donation of $10,000 or more to the United Way.  In 2000, Enron was the Society's leader in Houston with 49 members, and we also ranked in the top 25 nationally in total membership.  Your support this year will help Enron to continue as a leader among companies in this distinguished group.

Whatever your decision regarding your pledge, we need 100% participation from our executives in order to set a good example for the rest of EWS.  Your contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our community.  When you give, you change a life right here in the Houston area.

Please RSVP to Zulie Flores via e-mail at zulie.flores@enron.com or by phone at ext. 3-3908 by Friday, July 27 and join us in setting the standard for EWS by giving generously and getting your pledge in by August 10.

Mark and Greg

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Karen:  I was out of town yesterday, and am just now getting your message.  I will give you a call this morning to discuss.  The thing that concerns me the most is the reference to "inside view"-----if they have not talked to anyone at Enron, or don't attribute the "inside view" to some credible former Enron person, then it is misleading to call it an "inside view".  Absent false statements or breaches of confidentiality, if this is nothing more than someone's opinion of Enron and how it operates, then we probably can't stop them (I'm surprised that there is not more of this "stuff").  It would definately be helpful to get a copy of the report (even if we have to pay for it); without knowing what it says, it would be hard to say what action we can take. I will give you a call and we can discuss.  Thanks, Rex.

Rex -- Apparently this organization is attempting to sell this report about Enron that's purported to be an "inside view."  I called this morning and they never talked to anyone inside the company.  The president of the company is supposed to call me back -- I want to get a copy of this report.  But I wanted to send to you anyway.  Is there anything we can do to prevent them from marketing this? 

Thanks!

Attached is the Enron Americas gas VAR limit violation for April 20, 2001.  The head trader for Enron Americas is responsible for printing out a hard copy of this memo, signing it and returning the hard copy to Chris Abel who will forward it to RAC to obtain the appropriate signatures.  However, this is to be considered preliminary until the discretionary VAR memo has been signed.  I will follow up with a final memo at this time.

To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site and team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown

Per Sarah Davis' voice mail:

As we prepare to open Enron's child care center this fall, we invite you to join Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney and Sarah Davis on a tour of local child care centers to observe best practices in the Houston child care community. Your feedback is vital in helping us develop the best child care center for our employees. Though the tour will consume a significant part of your day, we believe that the knowledge gained from our site visits will be worth it. 

The tour will take place on Thursday, May 3rd. Our agenda follows:

	10:30 AM	Depart from front of Enron building via van
	11:15 AM	Tour Creme de la Creme Town and Country facility
	12:45 PM	Tour Knowledge Beginnings Katy facility
	2:15 PM	Tour Cathedral House Montessori School downtown facility
	3:30 PM	Debriefing Session (EB 1679) 
	4:15 PM	Adjourn


Thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedules to participate in this tour! Please RSVP to me at X-36202 no later than Wednesday at 10:00 AM to confirm your attendance. We look forward to seeing you Thursday!


Regards,

Charla Stuart

Nothing but good news everyday. Not sure I mentioned this: kerrigan's now running non-reg finance side at txu in dallas. We started talking about possibility of txu resetting eastern contract and writing us a big check (discount for early pay to be negotiated based on size). No word yet from legal on rolling el paso - ecp swaps back into ena and arguing setoff rights to get our collateral back we are posting el paso.

Thank you, first of all, for supporting us in our decision to
     reschedule the Summit. The following letter has been sent to all
     participants. Though we've been in touch with you by phone, we would
     greatly appreciate your reconfirming, as soon as you can, for our
     March event, as follows....


     TO:        FORTUNE Most Powerful Women in Business Summit
                Participants

     FROM:      Pattie Sellers

     DATE:      September 19, 2001

     RE:        Postponement of Summit


     My FORTUNE colleagues join me in hoping that you and your loved ones
     are safe during this time of tragedy.

     In the aftermath of last week's horrific events, we have decided to
     postpone the upcoming FORTUNE Most Powerful Women in Business Summit
     scheduled for October 3-5 in Pasadena.  The new dates and location are
     March 6-8, 2002, at La Quinta Resort & Club in Palm Springs,
     California.

     While certainly much could have been gained from bringing together
     this remarkable group of leaders at this time, it's clear that our
     participants need to stay close to their homes and businesses.

     Already, the March program promises to be every bit as strong as the
     October Summit.  Almost all of our speakers have confirmed that
     they can join us at La Quinta March 6-8. Carly Fiorina, Jack Welch,
     Oprah Winfrey, Andrea Jung, Shelly Lazarus, Pat Russo, Sherry
     Lansing, Gerry Laybourne, Jamie Gorelick, Lisa Caputo, Betsy Bernard,
     Lynn Forester, Louise Kitchen, Ann Richards, Stacey Snider, Ginger
     Graham, Nancy Peretsman, Anna Catalano, Marie Wilson, Peggy Brill,
     and Anna Deavere Smith have all locked in the new dates... and we
     hope you will too.

     Kindly let us know as soon as possible whether you can be with us next
     March by contacting Suzanne O'Leary at 212-522-9444 or
     Suzanne_o'leary@timeinc.com. Suzanne can arrange a full refund of your
     registration fee if you cannot join us at La Quinta. If you have
     already made reservations at The Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel & Spa
     in Pasadena, we will take care of canceling your room reservation for
     next month.

     Like you, we were anticipating an outstanding Summit next month. But
     we hope you agree with our decision to postpone it. We look forward to
     coming together in strength on March 6-8 to forge new and lasting
     relationships and to explore how extraordinary women rise to meet the
     challenges of extraordinary times.

Also, I will be finishing my next Monthly report today and would like to sit down with you to discuss this and all of the personnel changes that are on-going at ENA.

I've asked Margaret Carson to take a stab.  We have a meeting with DOE and Michael Miller this morning but will try and have something late afternoon.  Do you want to get together to go through our materials?

Jim,

Would someone in your group be able to put something together for me on the issues below (only about 2-3 pages),  Mark is speaking on several panels at the Natural Gas CEO summit in a week and the questions below are probably be best answered by you as I worry that we need to be consistent.  Could you get me something and I will combine it will the others.

I really need something by end of play Tuesday.

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

Sorry for the confusion. Attached is revised look at this report. You can now see the approver for each shopping basket created (Note: if approver is blank, the requistioner had authority to approve themselves). I have also opened the columns which show the shopping cart line item descriptions and amount. The shopping cart column was showing you the total of the shopping cart with each item in the basket which really is not very helpful. (i.e., 3 items ordered for $100, $200 and $300 respectively all in one shopping basket with the report showing that the shopping basket was $600).

Thanks
John

I am a bit confused I thought we had agreed to the following last week.

Expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved.

Issues:

Why are there so many repeat lines, each request is  issuing 3 times in some cases.  Will this mean we order three by accident?
I have no idea what has been ordered - last week I could see this time its all in code.  Please resend with descriptors.

Thanks

Louise

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Good Morning Louise!

Here is the first draft of the article for the ENSIDE Newsletter.  Please read and make any changes or corrections and send it back to me.
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you. 

 Also, what did you decide about the photo opportunity?  My photographer promises to give you several options for posing - behind your desk!

Please let me know and I will schedule him at your convenience.

Best regards,

John, we have completed the 3 year alliance starting Nov 1 with Syncrude. Great work by Dean Drozdiak and Gerry Hrap on closing arguably our most significant end-user gas deal to date. This should lead additional opportunities with other oil sands counterparties.

Everyone.

Dale Furrow is being considered for the position of Vice President - EWS/EES Retail Utility Risk Management.

Louise and John,

Thank you for having the meeting with all Gas and Power origination this morning.  I was very impressed by the employee attendance and your responses to individuals' concerns.  I would recommend having periodic meetings in the future.  My only disappointment was the most of my questions should have been articulated by my employees because they were concerns and queries articulated to me these past few days.  I have appropriately chided them and will chalk it up to stage fright.

Regards, Mrha

Louise, I would like you to re-consider our original proposal for a few rea=
sons.  I have a lot of history on this one given I've been on both sides of=
 the fence and was the original creator of what ultimately became the EIM g=
roup.  As a result, I  have been in many discussions with Lou and Jeff on t=
hese issues.

In the original agreement between EES and ENA the following SIC codes were =
excluded from EES as part of the minority shareholder agreement in 1996/199=
7:
=09Mining (except Oil and Gas);
=09Oil and Gas Extraction
=09Textile Manufacturing
=09Paper Manufacturing
=09Chemical Manufacturing
=09Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing
=09Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
=09Glass Manufacturing
=09Primary Metal Manufacturing
=09Fabricated and Metals Products Manufacturing
=09Machinery Manufacturing
=09Rail Transportation.

All other SIC codes fell within EES.  In 2000, with the buy-back of the min=
ority shareholders, Lou, Jeff and I agreed to move several of the lower pro=
cess load SIC codes into EES including Textile Manufacturing (like Springs =
Industries), Glass Manufacturing (like Owens Corning), Fabricated and Metal=
s Product Manufacturing (like General Cable and American National Can) and =
Machinery Manufacturing (like Lockheed Martin).  This was primarily because=
 these customers tend to be of lower energy sophistication and consumption,=
 numerous sites (in deregulated and regulated environments) and of small si=
ze.  The EES value proposition fit these customers much better than wholesa=
le.  We have completed numerous significant term transactions and outsource=
s in these industries (see parenthesis for several).

For the other SIC codes, these remained in ENA and EIM.  EES has no interes=
t in paper mills, smelters, fertilizer manufacturers, refiners, etc.  We ne=
ither have the products or pricing capability to manage or close very large=
 process oriented consumers.  However, there are divisions inside these com=
panies that we have been able to have some success.  For example, the speci=
ality chemicals divisions of the large chemical companies tend to be signif=
icantly smaller loads and ignored from a capital, DSM and commodity point o=
f view by the large purchasing agents.  Another example, is the gasoline re=
tailing networks for the large oil and gas/refining companies which can be =
very small loads spread over thousands of sites.  Another example, is the s=
pecialty paper/container board divisions of the paper companies.  In severa=
l of the large oil and gas and petrochemical companies we have found fertil=
e ground in their office buildings and research centers.  Our proposal to l=
imit EES's activities in the ENA SIC codes by consumption size was to give =
us some freedom to target these divisions inside these companies which ENA =
would normally ignore.  If there is a better way to split this out than by =
a size definition lets discuss.  Finally, given the more targeted and sophi=
sticated sales process utilized in EES (by necessity), it would be easier t=
o coordinate between the companies based on a size sort where EES had limit=
ed access to ENA's SIC codes versus the opposite.

On the surface your proposal looks reasonable; however, it fails to suffici=
ently manage the issues. For example:
=09- how would you manage a customer like Wal-Mart which may use more than =
10 MW at a site but requires a national or regional  solution for all 10,00=
0 sites in both deregulated and regulated jurisdictions;
=09- how will we sufficiently manage the ENA sales force which tends to ove=
r-cover and "under-product" for the vast majority of these industries and c=
ustomers ie) I think it would be a disaster for EES and ENA;
=09- and EES has the relationship based selling capability and basic produc=
ts to successfully manage these customers (you could argue right now that i=
s all we have!).

On a final note,  I believe strongly that John and I should send out a note=
 to both organizations clarifying these issues because:
=09a) it is way overdue - years in fact - it was always difficult when I wa=
s upstairs to get Lou to cooperate;
=09b) it is extremely destructive and un-productive for multiple Enron grou=
ps to communicate and target the same customer;
=09c) I don't believe that the employees (on both side of the fence) will h=
onor the obligation unless it is expressly stated, openly communicated and =
enforced by the two management teams;
=09and d) we need to be proactive, because "cleaning" it up after the dual =
call, etc significantly damages our credibility as Enron with a number of t=
hese customers.

It may be worthwhile in the same exercise to let you know what we may be do=
ing in the the utility and generator markets in the interest of open commun=
ication and ensure your buy-in.

I look forward to futher discussing this with you. Our motivations are not =
to try and  enter ENA markets but to split the industrial and commercial se=
gments between the two companies clearly which increases productivity and s=
hareholder value.

Regards
Delainey

Janet,

Tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon.  I have r=
emoved the split from East to West.

Load

Power
ENA > 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand
EES < 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand

Gas=20
ENA > 1,000 MMBTUs/day
EES < 1,000 MMBTUs/day

I am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like Fertilize=
r companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion =
tha add value.

Louise

Louise,

Sempra Energy has called and asked to "cover' outstanding positions with Enron.
They have done some deals with me this morning via EOL, as well as a "sleeve" with EPNG in order to minimize their exposure with us.  Indications were that they have longer dated power and other gas positions that they want to minimize as well,  I advised them to call the respected traders first, as apposed to calling voice brokers,  to see what they can facilitate.

The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

Thanks for your fast response.  I look forward to hearing back from you
and/or Louise with the data requested.  We have already had a large number
of inquiries about the case, even though it's not yet officially listed for
release.  I have a feeling we have a "best seller" on our hands.

My suggestions:

1)	Mountains (Jackson Hole, Aspen, Banff) are a nice respite from the Houston summer.  San Diego (or the Baja peninsula) are also nice - can combine golf, fishing and all kinds of outdoor activities.  More exotic locales could include Dominican Republic, Cabo San Lucas (5 championship courses in vicinity), Virgin Islands, Bermuda.  I'm not a big fan of Las Vegas (although there is some good golf in the area).

2)	Focus should be on (i) improving communication across business units (I'm surprised by the number of people on this e-mail that I don't know (well)) - perhaps presentations by each business unit reviewing 2000 and 1H 2001, (ii) identifying opportunities to profit from volatility in commodity and financial markets, (iii) create a "road map" strategic plan for the balance of 2001 and full year 2002.

3)	I love mountain climbing (lived in Switzerland for four years) and am happy to organize beginner course and/or expedition with trained mountaineers.  Great team building therapy.  Otherwise, I'm always up for golf, deep sea fishing, go kart racing, kayaking, skeet shooting, paint ball.

4)	Occasional off-sites are a great way to build/maintain morale and make sure everyone's on the same page regarding strategy/direction.

Call if you want to discuss in more detail.  I'm serious about organizing mountain climbing.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A	
Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3%

Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
---	pay and benefits
---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Louise--Enjoyed talking with you. We're inviting our Summit speakers and
panelists to invite a guest for Thursday evening, as follows.....ignore the
Aug. 13 deadline, but please let us know as soon as you can. Thanks!....

Louise--We're so looking forward to seeing you at the FORTUNE Most Powerful
Women Summit, and we'd like to extend an additional invitation: Would you
like to have a notable Los Angeles-area woman as your guest for our gala
evening Thursday, October 4? The dinner, at the Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena,
will include our keynote session with Jack Welch and also a special
performance by Tracey Ullman on "Women of Style and Substance."

The idea here is two-fold: to give speakers like you the opportunity to
include a special guest in one of the highlight sessions of the summit, and
to sprinkle the evening with some of LA's most influential women. We ask
that you keep this theme--powerful women of LA--in mind as you decide whom
to invite.

Please let Suzanne O'Leary (212-522-9444) or me know your suggested guest's
name and contact information by e-mail or phone by Monday, August 13, which
will allow us to coordinate the list and invitations. In the next few
weeks, we'll send an invitation to the person you suggest and note that
we'd like her to join us for the evening as your guest.

Thanks much, and all the best--Pattie, 212-522-2120

Thanks got a copy of several presentations. Looks like morale is pretty down in the US and London and the picture is looking too bright for the next six months.
Things are going well on this side of the world as we stay on track for our targets this year.  Brought in two originators, Rob Stewart from project Dolphin, and Martin Webb, who was in the UK office before going to Spain, to help build a more physical profile in the market.  Working on making Australia a good news story for growth and see the potential for some large global products deals - just got to convert potential to $$$.

See you sometime in Q3.

Cheers

Paul

Subject:	Re: HBS Case Study

Hi Rahil,

I'm attaching two EnronOnline cases that were put into our system couple of
weeks ago.
The second, short case, is a classroom handout that summarizes EOL's
success and signals new challenges.
Just FYI--we are now developing a multimedia EOL case, which will be
released on CD ROM.  It will have links to video interviews with Jeff, Ken
and Louise.

We are very happy with our Enron cases; they will most likely become
bestsellers.  It was a great learning experience for me and Prof. Bartlett,
and you were a big part of that experience.  Thank you so much for all your
help!  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or need
anything else.
Regards,
Meg

Louise-
 
Please accept my sincerest apology for the mistake of including the EA message in the last EnTouch. As you know, this electronic newsletter is to be a vehicle for information and Eric and I mistakenly thought this was news for all.  It will not happen again.
 
In addition, I am trying to find out why the Messaging Administration changed the EOL bullets into question marks. I intend to find out where the disconnect is between what I submit and later approve, and what is printed the next day. 
 
I have told them that this should never happen.
 
Please let me know what else I can do to make our internal communications better.
 
Kathie

Thank you for the offsite.  It was great to spend time with people from other parts of Enron Americas and to hear Greg speak so frankly about the issues and opportunities within the Company.  Next year I need to go into training before we go.

John:

Thanks for the e-mail.  I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specifically, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks at PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this "loss" of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, should be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only that each of these investments are "positions" that should be "owned" by someone, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't show up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Garland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset for a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon disposition, how do you evaluate the performance?

With respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.  I think he is doing a great job and showing a great deal of integrity in trying to get the best deal for Enron.  Let me know if you disagree.

Interesting reading.  Here's a quote:
Fastow's expert balancing act, in fact, has earned him this year's CFO Excellence Award for Capital Structure Management. "We needed someone to rethink the entire financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts," says Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron president and chief operating officer. "We didn't want someone stuck in the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways. He deserves every accolade tossed his way."

Hi Kim -

Dennis Vegas and I would like to set up a brief 15 minute meeting with John.  experienceENRON has already been supporting his commercial team, however, we would like to increase John's awareness about the repertoire of services in our group that can potentially help his team achieve their revenue goals.  By talking to John, it will also help us understand what opportunities exist in his organization and where we can add value. 

Dennis and I have been meeting with the wholesale services business unit leaders and would like a few minutes to meet John.  If possible we would like to combine a meeting with John and Louise, but let us know what John prefers.

Thank you.
Carrie

US Financial Markets

Emergency Site Relocation
The emergency site relocation for firms affected by the WTC bombing is going well on the fixed income and commodities trading side. Trading is being relocated largely to New Jersey and Connecticut. There was very significant contingency planning here, and it is being put to good use. The futures and equities markets are not moving as quickly due to telecommunications problems. Bond trading, which will resume in Tokyo tonight (as reported in the press), means that the cash market in the US should start to come back tomorrow.
Forex
The foreign exchange markets have been quiet, as the Fed reportedly stepped in and told people to settle their outstanding issues, but not to initiate new directional positions or large arbitrages.
Insurance
The insurance firms most affected by the crisis are ING Reinsurance and Allianz. These firms may have capital issues from insuring losses related to the crisis - they were overconcentrated in this area.
Transportation/Infrastructure Issues
Telecommunications
Communication issues continue to be the biggest problem. This is the only area where sufficient redundancy was lacking. For example, Citigroup is having problems with e-mail capacity and is cutting back on all non-essential e-mails. This continues to be the chief barrier to resuming operations.
Crude/Products/Refineries
LOOP Terminal now restored to regular operations.
Maritime Traffic
According to Dow Jones, dry bulk shipowners were reluctant to lease out vessels on long-term contracts Wednesday, after terrorist attacks in the U.S. Tuesday brought security issues to the fore

Air Traffic

Midway Airlines announced today that effective immediately it has suspended all future flight operations. Their press release states that "this action is being taken at this time in order to preserve the value available for Midway's interest holders and with the recognition that following the recent terrorist attacks demand for air transportation is expected to decline sharply." 

US-Canada Border  

BC border open but moving very slowly. Delay for trucks at BC truck crossing now up to about 6 hrs. Truckers being sorted into two groups, those with papers and order and those without papers in order.All trucks being checked extensively. Only US residents and those on important business are being let back into the US. 
Rail Traffic
All Canadian Pacfiic Railway (CPR - freight) operations in Canada and the US continuing to operate as normal. All CPR border crossings open and moving as planned.

Politics

Saudi Oil Minister states that Saudi Arabia and OPEC to cooperate to cover any oil supply shortage.

NATO expresses support for US; bolstering likelihood of massive reprisal.

Louise,

I absolutely agree with you about the panels the last two years -- they have been weak.  I think, though, that this should be looked at a little differently.  The purpose for this is to highlight the operations of our business and to showcase the next level of leadership.  I think rather than just focusing on one or two businesses, this format will allow us to hit each of them at a high level.  Mark will introduce each of you, talk a little about your backgrounds to help the VPs get familiar with our new leadership, and interject questions and generate discussion as appropriate.  To be honest, I see it as "rapid fire business unit presentations" as opposed to the typical panel.  

Let me know if you get a different sense from Mark.

Best,
Terrie

I'll talk to Frevert but I really thought the panel session last year was incredibly weak and don't think something of that format should be pursued again.  I would hope for a major change in format.

Yes, partly.  I saw John last week and he told me that his wife was due to deliver their second child on November 9 and he would possibly miss the conference.  However, I know Mark was also interested in having women represented and liked having both you and Janet on the panel to balance things out.

I know you'll do a great job -- you always do!

Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 << File: Sample Bullet Slide.ppt >> 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Regards,
Terrie James

Report below continues our reporting from yesterday and covers the impact of the terrorist attacks on US market openings/closings, energy infrastructure, and political outlook.  We will be providing a full strategy memo on the broader impact of the crisis on the US economy, world energy markets, and international security later today.

A.	Market Updates

U.S. Markets

?	US equity markets are closed today but may open Friday. NYSE/NASDAQ/AMEX officials will reconvene later today to decide on restart.
?	Regular NYMEX trading is cancelled for Thursday and no restart date has been determined.  NYMEX is trying to start ACCESS trade via internet on Thursday afternoon.
?	CBOT to close a/c/e electronic futures early at 1300 CDT.
?	The Federal Reserve Board injected $38.25 billion into the financial system yesterday by buying government bonds from investment houses. Typically it buys only a few billion dollars in bonds in a day.
?	Marsh & McClennan reports that about 700 employees who worked in one of the two towers are still missing.
?	Morgan Stanley chief executive Philip J. Purcell told MSDW employees that the "vast majority" of its 3,500 employees in the center had been accounted for.
?	Keefe Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank with headquarters near the top of the south tower, is searching for 69 of its 172 employees from its offices on the 89th and 90th floors.
?	The Securities and Exchange Commission's Northeast regional office was destroyed when the 7 World Trade Center building collapsed. Commission officials said they believed that all 300 employees were evacuated unharmed but hundreds of investigations, like a broad inquiry into initial public sales of stock in the late 1990's, would be hampered by the loss of notes and files that were kept only in that building.
?	IATA expects week's costs for airlines industry to reach $10B

Asia Overnight

?	Tokyo equities stabilize: TOPIX closes up, regaining and holding 1000 level; Nikkei tested below 9500 in morning session before closing unchanged; other Asia mostly higher

Europe

?	Mid-session all indices up marginally, FTSE strongest, within striking distance of 5000
?	ECB leaves rate unchanged; no coordinated G7 action on rates or currency
?	Gold: up marginally near $280 in range trading, no moves to support eary Wed. spike into low $290s
?	Brent Crude: down on Saudi, Kuwaiti support, pledges to make up any shortages

Forex

?	Eurodollars pricing inter-meeting Fed cut, but G-7 communique; BoE Eddie George's comments argue for consideration, monitoring over near term rather than any immediate action
?	The German Finance Ministry said on Thursday the upcoming meetings of the International Monetary Fund and G7 finance ministers may not take place as scheduled although final decisions had not been taken.

 B.	Transportation/Infrastructure Updates

Gas/Power/Nuclear Infrastructure
?	Pipelines, under a heightened state of security, are operating at normal levels.	
?	All 103 nuclear facilities remain at a heightened state of alert.
?	Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham (on Wednesday) ordered a halt to all shipments of nuclear materials and the suspension will remain in effect indefinitely.
?	Consolidated Edison, whose operations were most directly affect by Tuesday's events, said the attack on the WTC had damaged 3 substations (2 sustaining permanent damage) as well as major transmission lines into lower Manhattan.
?	As a result of the fire at the Pentagon, Washington Gas shut off gas to the building.  The distributor will turn service back on when Pentagon officials indicate that they are ready to restore service.
?	FERC does not plan to re-schedule the regular bi-monthly meeting that was canceled this week , said a spokeswoman for the agency. Instead, its next meeting will be Sept. 26.   Some of the orders that the Commission was to have considered "are time-sensitive and probably will have to go out prior to the meeting on the 26th," she noted.
	
Crude/Products/Refineries

?	Some analysts believe that additional attacks could be in the works.  One opinion is that future targets could include transportation or petroleum infrastructure.  For this reason, the resumption of normal operation at some petroleum import terminals might be delayed
?	Saudi and other Gulf states have pledged to maintain market stability.  The UAE oil minister said that if the price of oil remains above $30 during the OPEC meeting on September 26, "OPEC will concentrate on taking appropriate measures to stabilize the market at an appropriate level."
?	US government waives summer gasoline specs 3 days before expiry
?	In this situation (Mideast tensions and likely recession), OPEC will find great difficulty with its normal policy cutting production in order to keep prices strong. 
?	If the market comes to believe that OPEC is not capable of enforcing its price floor, it might renew its attack on the bottom of the band and drive prices lower.  If the market comes to believe that OPEC is not capable of enforcing its price floor, it might renew its attack on the bottom of the band and drive prices lower.
?	ExxonMobil Corp. released a statement urging consumers not to horde gasoline. "We have supply available for retail customers and to meet contractual obligations, and encourage customers to maintain their normal buying habits to avoid artificial runouts," the statement said.
?	House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, (R-La), stated that "The oil supply is hugely adequate?there is no reason for any American to gouge another American. Anyone who is doing that is aiding and abetting the terrorists."

Air Travel

?	Newark, La Guardia, Bush Intercontinental, Chicago O'Hare and Kennedy Airports are expected to be open only to incoming flights that were diverted to Canada on Tuesday.  Diverted flights expected to resume at 11am.
?	Logan Airport in Boston still closed.
?	Continental has suspended all scheduled flights today; diverted flights may operate
?	American Airlines has suspended regularly scheduled flights until noon CDT; most diverted flights will remain grounded until further notice.
?	Southwest has cancelled all flights until further notice and will not resume scheduled service today.
?	United will operate diverted flights today; scheduled service cancelled until noon.
?	US Airways has canceled flights until further notice; diverted flights will operate before scheduled service
?	American West expects to resume a portion of its flights at 3pm EDT, ramping up operations gradually over the weekend.
?	Delta expects to conduct very limited operations after noon EDT today. Inbound flights expected to begin arriving from Canada later today.  Westbound service from Europe expected to begin on Friday. Also, their website indicates that the Atlanta airport (Hartsfield) has been "certified" by the FAA.

Rail Travel

?	Amtrak operating a normal schedule.
	
Maritime Transportation

?	All major port cargo operations other than New York are open and continuing to do business.  Delays continue due to inspections in major ports, especially for tanker vessels.

C.	Political Updates

?	Bush administration building case for massive military reprisal; shoring up public support from NATO and key allies; seeking logistical and intelligence support from Pakistan.  Itar-Tass reportiing Pakistani delegation to Kabul to discuss bin Laden extradition w/ Taliban
?	Pentagon tasked with drawing up plans for military reprisal, but Secretary of State Powell has stated that "we're far from selecting any particular military targets."
?	The options under consideration include more powerful, sustained attacks that accept greater risk to American forces, and may include bombing attacks by manned aircraft and landing special forces troops on the ground.
?	This is a nightmare scenario for Arab leaders.  The situation was already tense due to Arab-Israeli fighting; it will now get worse as the Bush Administration demands absolute cooperation in its anti-terrorism policy, which may include military attacks against states in the region.  Mideast leaders are very worried by reports that some of the terrorists may have been nationals of their countries (Saudi, Egypt, UAE).  They are also uncomfortable with displays of celebration in some Arab lands.  Their immediate priority is to demonstrate that they are on America's side, thus the rapid reassurances on oil supplies.  
?	Israeli officials and intelligence analysts reportedly believe that the attacks were too large an operation for any one group. Iraq is viewed as the most likely sponsor.
?	Iraq says US and British planes raid southern Iraq, hit homes.  US and UK deny the report.
?	Israel steps up attacks on Palestinians; 13 Palestinians killed since Wednesday
?	Senate's comprehensive energy bill, like most legislation in Congress, is on hold following Tuesday's attacks.  No updated legislative calendar has been announced.

Interesting piece on Skilling's departure (mentions EnronOnline as the only success we've seen in recent times).

Went VERY well.  Lots of positive vibes afterwards and goodwill towards both of you.  People most appreciated executives admitting to the fact that things were wrong and they were frustrated too, but everyone needs to get over it.  Big change from past history of blaming everyone but ourselves and just glossing over the real problems and making them sound better....

Side note:  JL uses the word "I" a bit too much.

With Luce - not Shively (he'd gone).  They are all upset by Jean's approach, nothing to do with John Grass at all.  I think we move on NUG and worry about the way forward for Jean when we have our gas meeting - the origination heads plus Hunter and Arnold.  
 
I think both her and Hunter feel that Jean is saying they do not know how to do their own jobs - eg managing Peoples.  Apparently there have been a few conversations between Jean and Origination/Trading Group heads but not Laura.  
 
She fully agreed we want to keep Grass.

Louise - Current status on Drift expense allocations....  We have reviewed the $11.8 million in question and that amount is correct given the methodology being used by Gary to allocate costs.  When Gary is back in the office on Thursday, I will go through his allocations with him to determine if we need to change that methodology and thus change the allocation percentages.  I will let you know the outcome of that meeting.

Also, keep in mind that the $11.8 million represents a Plan amount.  Actuals should be much less since we are currently well under Plan headcount amounts and not all Plan expenses have been made.  Let me know if you have any questions - I will keep you updated.

Regards,

Brent

Mike and I have discussed the Drift plan and clearly there was an allocation issue somewhere along the line.  Please let us have our new numbers.

Good morning,
Below is the preliminary information for the August meeting that I sent to John last week.  There are some time sensitive issues with deposits for some of the venues.  Would you please review the information and if I could have a few minutes of your time, I would really appreciate it.
Thanks.

Attached is a file containing the following information for your management meeting in Beaver Creek (August 16-19, 2001):
	Preliminary Agenda
	Cost Estimate
	Outside Speaker Options
I am holding 3 Enron aircraft for this event and have included that price in the cost estimate.
I have reviewed all the video tapes for the outside speakers with the exception of the political humorists.  The only one that I would not recommend is Joe Malarkey.  I thought his material was 'pure malarkey' - but that is just my opinion.  I have bios if you would like to see them.  We are not limited to this list - I can check pricing and availability for anyone that you would like to suggest.
Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks.

Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Attached is the Enron Americas master schedule of events for 2001.
The approval process that was established in EA has enabled my department to easily track event costs and provide overall savings by leveraging the fees for items such as hotel rates, audio/visual, transportation and printing charges.
I will update this schedule after each quarter.

Karen,

Thanks so much; I will touch base with Greg before Saturday to provide him
with additional details and logistics.

Actually, one of our Advisory Board members at Genesis Park, Paul Hobby,
submitted his name as a nominee.  Obviously, Jeff is one of those leaders
that comes to everyone's mind when you think of the power of eCommerce and
the Internet!

We appreciate your support and will get you copies of photos from the event
as well as press coverage that is received.

Enron's Departure from Core Business
Takes a Toll on Performance=20

  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) stock sustained further he=
avy losses on October 19 as investor confidence in the former Wall Street f=
avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in=
 over four years. The energy giant's stock was off $3.32 or 11.45 percent a=
t $25.68 per share at mid-day trade on Oct. 19, making a cumulative loss of=
 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third-quarter loss of $638 mi=
llion. As of early morning trading on Oct. 22, Enron shares were priced at =
$21.99, a reflection of new developments (including a new Securities and Ex=
change inquiry) that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest=
ors.=20

Analysis: Enron's first financial report since the departure of former CEO =
Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor=
 confidence in the company, which has experienced one of its most turbulent=
 years in recent memory. While Skilling cited personal reasons for his depa=
rture, many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enron's share pri=
ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role. A=
t the time of Skilling's departure, Enron's stock had tumbled to a 52-week =
low. However, based on the new 3Q report, it now appears that Enron's downw=
ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company=
's top spot. In essence, Enron's financial problems have been caused by bus=
inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor=
e focus on wholesale power sales. It appears that Enron is learning a costl=
y lesson-namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company'=
s innovation, especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis=
ed. The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron, as a good number of unre=
solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry in=
to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow=
 the company.=20

Let's first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t=
hird quarter. As noted, as a whole the company reported $638 million in los=
ses, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its n=
on-core businesses. When we break down the losses, it becomes clear that En=
ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses: water, broadband=
 and the retail power market. Specifically, Enron reported $287 million in =
charges from Azurix, its water and wastewater business; $180 million in cha=
rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations (including sever=
ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts); and $544 =
million in what the company is calling "investment losses." Evidently, abou=
t half of the $544-million figure is related to Enron's investment in NewPo=
wer Company, the retail electricity and natural-gas provider that Enron lau=
nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM. Enron owns =
45 percent of NewPower. In addition, Enron's debt to total capitalization r=
atio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent, although Lay says that p=
ending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002.=
 However, it is important to note that Enron's 3Q recurring net income (bef=
ore the write-offs) did increase 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a =
diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 bi=
llion in 3Q 2000.=20

The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting. As one of=
 the leading investors in the company, Enron drove NewPower's aggressive bu=
siness focus on retail residential power sales, despite ongoing concerns ab=
out the development of retail competition across the United States. NewPowe=
r went public last year at an opening price of $21, and in the early days o=
f its initial public offering was trading above that price. However, the co=
mpany's stock has experienced a devastating drop in value, and is currently=
 priced at $1.25. NewPower is not scheduled to release its own 3Q financial=
 statement until early November, but it is expected that the company will c=
ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Specificall=
y, NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3Q loss of $6=
5 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. Third-quarter revenue =
reportedly will be slightly lower than the $60 million to $65 million that =
the company had forecast in August.=20

In analyzing NewPower's 2Q financial losses (see IssueAlert from 8/8/01 at =
www.scientech.com/rci <http://www.secure.scientech.com/IssueAlert>), I argu=
ed that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negativ=
e factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in re=
sidential and small business markets in the United States. On the positive =
side, NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts=
, most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from=
 AES Corp. and DTE Energy. These purchases prompted an impressive growth sp=
urt for NewPower, and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 =
markets in 10 states. However, the bad news for NewPower is that its losses=
 continue to widen, apparently resulting from a combination of weather fact=
ors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the compa=
ny operates. This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better, and t=
he company's stock has continued to drop as a result.=20

In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes, NewPower recently rev=
ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp. and several of i=
ts subsidiaries. The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas=
h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th=
rough Jan. 4, 2002. With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak=
e to Enron, NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour=
ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset=
-based financing.=20

However, from Enron's perspective, the losses associated with NewPower (and=
, by the same token, the losses in water and broadband) have contributed to=
 a steady drop in its own stock price. The message is clear: The businesses=
 that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as =
a whole. Further, what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enron's p=
art has not translated into measurable profits, and consequently Wall Stree=
t has reacted by sending Enron's stock to a level that is about half of whe=
re it was a year ago. The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all=
 unique, but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh=
at was a successful core business. Further, they are similar in that Enron =
aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i=
t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth. The problem with Enron'=
s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f=
iber-optic lines, which has prevented the demand for the division's service=
s from materializing as anticipated. The problem with Azurix, which has bee=
n losing money since its formation in 1998, is that privatization of the wa=
ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant=
icipated. In addition to these problem areas, Enron also faces challenges r=
elated to its investments in India (where it is locked into a legal battle =
with the state government) and California (from which Enron has yet to rece=
ive full payment for previous power sales).=20

In addition to the losses outlined in the 3Q report, there are new issues t=
hat are brewing at the start of this week. First, the SEC has requested tha=
t Enron provide information regarding "certain related party transactions."=
 Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry.=
 However, it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate=
d to the dealings of Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who up =
until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E=
nron. Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SEC's reque=
st. In a separate development, several mutual funds (including AIM Constell=
ation that once held large positions in Enron) have either liquidated or re=
duced their holdings in the company, which has further weakened Enron's sto=
ck value. Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about =
Enron's ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an =
energy trader.=20

The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r=
emains on solid ground despite the losses. Thus, Lay has been quick to reit=
erate that earnings from the company's energy and gas-pipeline business are=
 still strong. Further, Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua=
rter should be seen as a way to "clear away issues that have clouded the pe=
rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses." Neverthele=
ss, the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i=
ts diversification effort, and in addition to water and broadband the compa=
ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well. Thus, se=
veral questions remain at this juncture. Are the losses reported in the thi=
rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t=
he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad=
ing? Or, will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002? Moving =
forward, will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the=
 various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably? On=
ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En=
ron, which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change.=20

We can talk about it at 10:00am, however, I do not think the split will work as you propose. The vast majority of the industrial process load uses more than 25 MW on peak which is and should continue to be the focus of ENA. The target companies and sites we will focus on down here will  average somewhere in the 10-20 MW peak range(remember, non-process load, aggregation of sites).

After EES bought back the minority shareholders, there has been increasing overlap in the marketplace between EES/ENA. The reasoning behind deliniating where and how each group will focus was to alleviate the external overlap, reduce any friction between the groups, and increase both groups productivity. 

I don't think there should be any issue on the Fertilizer companies, but I'll doublecheck.

Talk to you at 10:00am.

Believe it or not - I am still finalizing the individual plans for each of hte Enron Americas. I notice we are currently picking up all 19 people from Gary Hickerson's group which I presume is a mistake.  I assume we will get some form of allocation based on the work he does for ENA but  probably not $11.64 million/annum.  I am going to let the accounts team know there is an issue but could one of you let me know who is responsible for the plans in your group.

Just thought I'd check that I wasn't missing something.

         April 17, 2001      Economy Electricity Facilities Sprout Near Tin=
y Tennessee Town By JOHN J. FIALKA  Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURN=
AL NUTBUSH, Tenn. -- This town of about 100 people hasn't seen anything qui=
te this electrifying since the 1950s when a local teenager, Annie Mae Bullo=
ck, left town and became Tina Turner, the queen of rock 'n' roll. Power pla=
nts are sprouting in the flat, rich cotton fields nearby. One is under cons=
truction; another is about to start. Bulldozers are grooming a site for a t=
hird. "We think it's great," says Alvin Williams, owner of the Nutbush Groc=
ery and Deli, as he prepares for the surge of construction workers who come=
 in for lunch. While this may seem promising at a time of growing energy sh=
ortages, the new plants are part of a power clash that presents the Bush ad=
ministration and federal and state regulators with one of their knottiest p=
roblems: Who controls the nation's power grid? On one side is a new breed o=
f freewheeling energy dealers called merchant traders, spurred by deregulat=
ion to generate and trade electricity. Led here by Enron  Corp., they build=
 small gas-fired generating plants, but most don't construct their own powe=
r lines. Instead, they hook up the plants to existing lines and sell electr=
icity wholesale over long distances when prices peak during the summer. Thu=
s, many of their plants are called "peakers." On the other side are old-lin=
e utilities, represented here by the federally owned Tennessee Valley Autho=
rity. They operate the power lines and warn that the system could become ov=
erloaded, leading to blackouts from the imbalance. Near Nutbush here in Ten=
nessee's southwest corner, natural-gas pipelines run from the Gulf Coast an=
d intersect with some of the TVA's 17,000 miles of transmission lines, whic=
h are spread over seven Southern states. That is what is making Nutbush boo=
m: It is an attractive place to connect to the grid.  By 2003, at least 13 =
new merchant plants altogether will be hooked up across the TVA's system. T=
here will be dozens more on neighboring systems that will also use TVA line=
s, says W. Terry Boston, a TVA executive vice president. This year, TVA exp=
ects 300,000 requests for wholesale power deals on its system, up from 250,=
000 last year and just 25,000 in 1996. Mr. Boston foresees a congestion pro=
blem that will make it more difficult for the utility to maintain its recor=
d of 99% reliability. "This summer is going to be interesting," he says. Co=
mbat started here in the spring of 1999, when an Enron plant at nearby Brow=
nsville began bombarding TVA with about 800 requests for summer transmissio=
n service, up from 33 the TVA had received from merchant plants the year be=
fore. Some were huge, elaborate trades involving brokered electricity from =
other sources that Enron wanted to ship across the TVA system. Kevin Presto=
, an Enron vice president, recalled: The TVA "pretty much fought us the who=
le way, even though they needed the megawatts." That June, TVA pulled the p=
lug, telling Enron that from then on, its wheeling and dealing would be con=
fined to the amount of electricity produced in Enron plants. Enron claimed =
foul and appealed to the North American Electric Reliability Council, or NE=
RC,, a voluntary organization of utilities and electricity consumers. Along=
 with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state regulators, NERC f=
unctions as the traffic cop for North America's power grid. Enron also sued=
 the TVA and the dispute "raised a number of issues that we are trying to p=
ut our fingers on," says Don Benjamin, NERC's director of operations. One u=
pshot is that it is busy rewriting the rules for how the national grid is c=
ontrolled. The Bush administration's energy task force and Congress are als=
o looking at the control issue and ways to expand the grid's capacity. So f=
ar, they have found no easy or inexpensive answers.  The grid, with its den=
se webs surrounding major cities and few links in between, resembles a U.S.=
 highway map from the 1930s before the Interstate system was built. And it =
is governed by rules that were negotiated by utilities at about that time, =
as they began to interconnect their systems with their neighbors'. Big util=
ities became "control areas" that perform the moment-to-moment adjustments =
that keep lines from overloading and equipment from melting down. With elec=
tricity, supply must always match demand. But lately, operators of merchant=
 plants, such as Enron, have also qualified to become control areas. Regula=
tors have ordered utilities to give merchant power plants open access to th=
e grid, though the utilities sometimes curtail access for "reliability" rea=
sons. "This was a very good system," sighs Thomas Overbye, an engineering p=
rofessor at the University of Illinois. But while merchant plants have more=
 access to the grid, he notes, they have little incentive to build more pow=
er lines. "When you restructure that way," asserts Mr. Overbye. "You're goi=
ng to overload the system, and that's exactly what's happening." NERC's Mr.=
 Benjamin worries that control will get harder this summer. "We've got to b=
e able to look at this and see what effects these deals are having on the w=
hole system," he says. Some ad hoc curtailment of wholesale deals and servi=
ce to customers may be necessary to protect the grid, but the result will b=
e expensive, he notes. "It means that merchants won't make money on that de=
al, and that the customer they sold power to will have to buy it from someb=
ody else." In the summer of 1999 there were such 70 curtailments; last summ=
er there were 180. Lynn Church, president of the Electric Power Supply Asso=
ciation, which represents 40 merchant power companies and electricity trade=
rs, suspects that decisions taken by big utilities for "reliability" reason=
s are sometimes used to block legitimate competition from her members. To p=
revent this, her group wants more federal control over the grid. "We're see=
ing lots of discrimination." The TVA's Mr. Boston counters that his system =
can't take more "surprises," such as the one on Aug. 19, 1999, when a serie=
s of wholesale trades brought the TVA's part of the grid to the brink of co=
llapse from the overload. This year, Enron settled its fight with the TVA w=
ith a secret out-of-court settlement. Enron says it is also in the process =
of selling the plant near here and two others it had hooked to the TVA syst=
em to other merchant power producers. But it is still waging war over who c=
ontrols the grid. In a separate case now before the U.S. Supreme Court, Enr=
on argues that FERC has the power to open more of the grid's capacity to me=
rchant power plants. Utility commissioners from several states argue it doe=
sn't. While this is going on, FERC is pondering how to cut back the grid's =
proliferating number of control areas. Right now there are about 150. Accor=
ding to one FERC expert, who asked not to be identified, to avoid "complica=
tions" there should be around 14. Meanwhile, officials in Tina Turner's hom=
e turf still want the power plant construction to keep on rocking. "There's=
 going to be others," predicts John Sharpe, the executive of Haywood County=
, who has been out recruiting more power plants to keep the local economic =
boost going. "I'm working my pants off to try and make that happen." Write =

The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

Transportation as a commodity.
By BILL HENSEL JR.

09/10/2001
JoC Week

Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy giant, is familiar with commodity
markets. In addition to energy, the business for which it is best known,
Enron is the world's largest metals trader. The company also understands
transportation. It ships products as diverse as coal, steel, forest
products and project cargo. Now Enron is proposing to change the face of
over-the-road trucking and domestic intermodal services, by treating
them as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product.

The company's Enron Freight Markets unit promises to help shippers and
carriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and
other shipping costs. Enron will quote a set rate for dock-to-dock
moves, and guarantee the service promised in the contract.
Enron Freight Markets was created in March to develop a market for
freight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in
transportation. As in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork
bellies, a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery
of the service or closing out his position.

Enron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in
energy. Can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight
capacity? Barry Par-ker, a consultant for BDP1 Consulting Ltd., which
specializes in freight economics, said it could work but that
transportation isn't like other markets. "The marketplace needs these
things, but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to
them," Parker said. "I applaud what they are doing, but it is an uphill
battle."

Enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of
Webmodal, a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and
logistics services for carriers, shippers and service providers. The
former Webmodal office in Chicago houses Enron Freight's 24-hour
customer service and operations center. This summer, Enron took another
step, by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major
trucking companies. Enron said it recently signed its first firm sales
contract with a major shipper, but declined to identify it.

Dan Reck, vice president of Enron Freight Markets, said the company can
offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are
considerably different from any others. "What Enron Freight Markets is
trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the
freight market," Reck said.

A key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and
conditions. The standardized areas would include specific delivery
times, and specific consequences for non-performance. Fixed-price
contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges, spikes in shipping volumes
and fluctuating carrier rates. Enron said it can do that not only
because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid, but also by using
its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having
customers sign long-term contracts.

"What ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be-comes
much more clean and predictable," Reck said. "So from a carrier's
perspective, they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece
of their business. There are very clean operational parameters. We are
also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and
conditions."

Enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural
gas and electric-power markets, and is trying to change the way other
markets, such as steel, are structured. EFM sees transportation as
another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or
speculation.

"We are kind of commodity-agnostic," Reck explained. "We don't care what
the commodity is, we just sell capacity."

Enron's approach differs significantly from others that have entered the
trucking field as technology-based intermediaries. NTE, the former
National Transportation Exchange, puts buyers and sellers directly
together, while Logistics.com uses the contracting process to identify
the most cost-effective matches between shippers and carriers. Unlike
the online services, Enron contracts directly with the party involved
and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website.

Under Enron's ideal contract, damages for non-performance are spelled
out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers
must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract. For example,
suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $1.20 per mile for a
shipment of freight between Atlanta and Chicago. If Enron does not
provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the
carrier can find is 70 cents per mile, Enron pays the difference. The
same process would work in reverse. If the carrier promised to provide a
truck and didn't, Enron would provide a replacement at a higher price
and the trucker would have to make up the difference.

Reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by Enron but
would evolve through negotiations or public forums. Efforts are under
way to introduce the company to shippers, carriers and other
intermediaries. Enron officials say they've talked with 400 to 500
shippers since March.

One goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking
association or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a
forum for negotiations, which the company believes would add legitimacy.

In its first contract, Enron is acting as a carrier, since the shipper
already was working with a third-party logistics provider. Enron
considers itself distinct from 3PLs. It focuses on dock-to-dock moves
and leaves supply-chain optimization to others. Its aim is to allow
parties to minimize risk, for example by giving shippers the ability to
hedge against the possibility of diesel pass-through fees.

Enron is an extensive user of the Internet, however, and last year
launched EnronOnline for traders to trade natural gas, oil, electricity
and various other commodities online.

No one expects Enron's new freight capacity product to capture immediate
acceptance. Even Enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow. Reck
said it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the
freight industry, and that Enron is prepared for that. "We have done
that in every market we have gotten into," Reck said. "What we find is
the economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance
over time. You have to show what the benefits are."

In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support, we are pleased to announce the following organizational change will be effective immediately.  A new business unit, Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which will include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Production Corporation (NEPCO).

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, as Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under John Gillis, President.

With the majority of EE&CC and OEC's activities focused on assets and projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the efforts of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports.  While EEOS will be a stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.

This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects.  Consistent with this approach, Development Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units which they support.  

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design, construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron's assets on a global basis.

This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world.

Please join us in congratulating Brian and Keith on their new assignments.

Mark Frevert & Dave Delainey

Chris -- In response to your e-mail, here are some quantitative facts that will give your students some insights about the scope of the economic return created by EnronOnline. 

1.  EnronOnline supports Enron's Wholesale Services division.  In 2000, IBIT (Income before interest, minority interests and taxes) for Enron Wholesale Services division rose 72% to $2.3 billion, with record physical energy volumes of 51.7 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (TBtue/d) -- a 59% increase over 1999.  Both of these growth rates were very significantly higher than growth rates we experienced in previous years.  For example, for the past five years, wholesale services earnings have grown at an average compunded growth rate of 48% annually.

2.  It took nearly a decade for Enron's daily gas transactions in North America to reach 13.9 bcf in 1999.  Just 12 months later, EnronOnline had helped to practically double daily transactions to 24.7 Bcf.  

 If you have any questions on this, please call me at 713 853 9354.  Thanks

Kal Shah

Hi Chris!

Thanks for the message and the great experience at Harvard last week!  Harvard's hospitality was the best!!

I'm travelling right now and only have a minute, but I've passed along your request to Louise and will follow up with her and the totality of your request on  Monday. ( I also told Louise she was a "star in absentia" at Harvard last week!!!)

Take care and we'll speak soon!

Best!

Christie:

Following up on my message of last week, I have now finished the minor
edits required to clarify the Enron Online case (correcting the stock
price, clarifying the "One to Many" versus "Many to Many" models of
trading, etc.).  The one piece that remains for me to insert is some
information that will allow the students to make some estimates about the
economic risk involved in this bold move.  I know that wholesale services
contributed about 89% of Enron's total profit in 1999, but it is unclear
what extent of this was provided by the traditional trading activities that
subsequently were enhanced by Enron Online. My suspicion is that it is the
majority of the sales volume, and perhaps the majority of profitability,
but if we could give some clue to that in the case, it would be
helpful.  This might simply be that "trading activities constituted the
majority of wholesale services profits" or "the vast majority" or "over
80%" or whatever you think would give the students some sense of
quantification.  The alternative might be to provide data that was
disguised and could be footnoted as such.  For example, we could identify
that trading contributed "over $750 million to Enron's net profits" with
that number footnoted as a disguised figure.

The other thing that would be very helpful would be again to provide some
data on the profitability of operations in 1999 versus the profitability in
2000 when Enron Online became a dominant part of its activities.  Once
again, we could include broad-level generalizations or disguised
data.  It's your choice, but it will give the students a sense of the size
of the issue facing them.

If it is helpful to talk about this in person, please feel free to call me
on 617-495-6308 today (Thursday); or tomorrow (Friday) in the afternoon at
802-457-1880.

Once again, thanks so much not only for the cooperation on the case, but
also for the terrific organization you did in getting your executive team
up here for last week's classes.  I think you probably realized that it was
a "home run" with the students, who are still talking about it.

Best wishes,
Chris

Louise - On April 10, our analysts at Merril Lynch (Donato Eassey and Carl Kirst) are hosting an evening with senior mgmt. of energy merchants for 25 of their top insitutional clients.  The event will be at South Shore Harbor.  We have arranged this on your calendar to participate as the senior Enron rep.  Other energy attendees we know of at this point include:

El Paso 	Clark Smith
Dynegy  	Mat Shoutsman
Williams  	Bill Hobbs
Duke  		____ Kelly
Enron  		You

I do not have a specific agenda or client list yet - will send as soon as available.  
 
Starting mid afternoon (time to be confirmed - likely between 2 and 2:30), Merrill will set up 5 separate conference rooms with a company in each conference room.  They will rotate 5 clients from room to room every 20 minutes to 1/2 hour to meet with each company executive and IR person.    They would like each company to put together no more than 5 slides with their strategy, focusing on distinctions.  The sessions will be informal, allowing the firms to ask specific company-related questions.

Donato has been a long-time sailor and has a 50+ foot boat.  At 5:00 p.m. they will take the boat to The Aquarium (you can also drive to the Aquarium - 10 mins.).  Dinner will be at 6:00 and this should be done by 8:00 p.m.  At that time they will board the boat again back to South Shore Harbor.  Whoever decided to drive to dinner can leave at that time (might be a reasonable alternative for someone in late stage pregnancy!).

We don't often ask mgmt. to give up an evening when in Houston, but this event is important to Merrill.  I expect the to 25 firms represented to be worthwhile.  I very much appreciate your availability - will be in touch with more specifics.  

Thanks, Paula

Louise -- Just got a call from Pattie Sellers with Fortune magazine.  They'd like to change your panel for the October conference -- instead of speaking on "Navigating Globally," they'd like you to speak on the panel, "Pushing the Boundaries."  It's a more high-profile panel -- it opens the session on Thursday morning.  Other speakers include Andrea Jung, CEO of Avon, and Lynn Forester, co-CEO/Chairman of FirstMark Communications (she raised $1 billion in private equity and is building a broadband network in Europe.)  Maria Bartiromo of CNBC will be the moderator.

I think you should agree to participate in this panel instead.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks!

Dynegy vs. Enron:
A "Tale of Two Companies"=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

Facts: Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in the third quarter, repo=
rting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share=
, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in =
2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and boosted the c=
ompany's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization of $14.=
5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a 52-week =
high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the co=
mpany's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500 com=
panies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778=
 people.=20

Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for the third quart=
er, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its no=
n-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-=
offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, an=
d revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000.=
 Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currently=
 trading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company an=
d is considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron empl=
oys 20,600 people.=20

Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and appears to still be o=
n a roll in terms of its financial performance. In contrast, Enron faced an=
 unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently languishing in a low ebb, =
characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp=
any's financial reporting. While the two companies operate in the same mark=
et space of power trading and are fierce competitors, Dynegy-ironically the=
 younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry success story whil=
e Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be addressed in=
 this article are: What is Dynegy doing "right"? What is Enron doing "wrong=
"? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this "=
tale of two companies"?=20

Although they are often referred to as "cross-town rivals," Dynegy and Enro=
n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their divergent=
 approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the single-m=
ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of 20=
01. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies, an=
d-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strateg=
y is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on =
two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key =
areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi=
ch the companies have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors.=20

Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and converged into the =
power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where their similar=
ities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid=
edly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary,=
 let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it needs t=
o own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gas trading =
sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of ph=
ysical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa=
ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry.=20

Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron first since it =
is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul=
t to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm=
odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers. The=
 participation and success in commodity markets, according to Enron, does n=
ot necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company has routi=
nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh=
olesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos=
ophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell th=
e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues.=20

As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns 2,000 MW of genera=
tion and 41,600 kilometers of electric T&D lines) in 1996 as a way to launc=
h its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When competition fizzled=
 in that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales block (a sale=
 of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing). Like=
wise in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent trading companies, En=
ron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and,=
 unlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional genera=
ting units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to its=
 most recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, =
Enron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint own=
erships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies=
 operating in the power trading sector.=20

Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr=
om Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, "Dynegy's long-term strategy =
is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets, which supports=
 earnings sustainability." Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy has been=
 on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing its g=
eneration capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of =
generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,0=
00 miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive area=
s. The company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the =
U.S. market, within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired ass=
ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just =
as often it has purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy a=
cquired Illinova in early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating ca=
pacity. Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, wher=
e it is presently planning to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in En=
gland. Dynegy executives have argued that natural-gas storage is the best w=
ay to back up a natural-gas trading operation. There's no question that the=
 approach is working. Out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the t=
hird quarter, $263 million of it came from the company's main wholesale bus=
iness.=20

The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be=
tween Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be overlooked. It i=
s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach. Owning phys=
ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour=
se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and=
 anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actu=
al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a=
 trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be=
 in a particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load a=
nd when shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on in=
frastructure, it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market=
 unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By t=
he same token, those companies that do control physical assets often have g=
reater communication with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (=
the difference between various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson=
 fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t=
he volatility of price, and being capable of resolving balances when shorta=
ges exist. This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp=
lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in=
 power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both natural-gas pipelines and =
power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities.=20

On the other side of this argument, a case could be made that Enron's appro=
ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility. Certainly,=
 by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron has less capital o=
n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a scenario when ma=
rket prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not have heavy=
 capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as=
set-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe=
d payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find th=
at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit=
ies in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasin=
gly focused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential conce=
rn for investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establ=
ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r=
equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What E=
nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being=
 tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po=
rtfolio.=20

Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the "g=
reat debate" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's overall perfor=
mance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not necessari=
ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring new ge=
neration facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted primarily=
 from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses (broadband a=
nd water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core wholesale trad=
ing business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha=
s been quick to reiterate to investors. "Our 26-percent increase in recurri=
ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who=
lesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines," Lay sai=
d. "The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leadi=
ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook."=
=20

Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets, the key issu=
e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn=
ings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing new line=
s of business. Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point. Enron,=
 which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged i=
nto the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the lead=
ership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into =
purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quic=
kly become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company "could have gotten in=
to the broadband business with less capital" and that Enron "spent too much=
 too soon" in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non-=
recurring write-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quar=
ter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by redu=
cing future costs in this sector to $40 million a quarter.=20

Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom=
 sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t=
o Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s=
ector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its broadband bu=
siness compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported. However, Dyneg=
y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities (electricity=
 and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa=
y that merely supplements its core business.=20

It is also important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage w=
hen it developed EnronOnline, an electronic trading exchange. In fact, Enro=
n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space, well ahead =
of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi=
rect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards, =
but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s=
uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its =
competitors. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha=
s recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since its incep=
tion in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional tr=
ansactions.=20

At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their =
approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often been accused =
of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently struggling from=
 a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues =
an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's CFO. To my rec=
ollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet,=
 and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more solid. As I =
don't expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any=
 time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we will cont=
inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and =
Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. A=
s noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, =
but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. Th=
at doesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way t=
o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos=
e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous.=
=20

In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to=
rtoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which company is the t=
ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between the two is =
far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point, based on i=
ts more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is how bot=
h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo=
dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies.=20

Louise:

I know this is a difficult time for Enron given the incident at Teeside, but I wanted to let you know that Principal Investments actually has an investment in a company called Serveron (www.serveron.com) which makes a product that monitors transformers for risk of failure.  This product/service may be a worthwhile investment at our facilities given the unfortunate accident of today and our desire for a superior safety record.

Regards,

Charlie

Untangle Financial Jargon

By Colleen Bazdarich
http://www.business2.com/siteunseen?nl=su


Companies' quarterly conferences are now open to investors. But
listening in, you might very well suspect that bigwig executives and
Wall Street analysts are using esoteric lingo to confuse matters. Next
time you're feeling left out, consult InvestorWords.com's copious
directory, which houses more than 5,000 definitions to help you decode a
company's latest earnings announcement or press release.

Browse through the dictionary by alphabetical list, or search for a
specific word. The coolest thing about this site: Each definition is
densely hyperlinked so that, within each entry, every word that's listed
elsewhere in the dictionary gets a link to its own definition. If you
look up Ebitda, for example, you'll find hyperlinks to each of the
financial terms that make up the acronym: earnings, interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization.

If you find the size of the InvestorWords database overwhelming, check
out the glossary pages, which contain definitions for more specific
subjects, from accounting to venture capital.

I think we have 3 that are on my list and not on yours.  We have big differences in order.  I'm very concerned about this process.  I'll send you dave's email and you might understand why.
 
Call me or resend me an email.

Yes, partly.  I saw John last week and he told me that his wife was due to deliver their second child on November 9 and he would possibly miss the conference.  However, I know Mark was also interested in having women represented and liked having both you and Janet on the panel to balance things out.

I know you'll do a great job -- you always do!

Subject:	Management Conference - Business Unit Panel


Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 << File: Sample Bullet Slide.ppt >> 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Regards,
Terrie James

Just to ensure that I am supplying you with the correct information, by profit centers do you mean commercial teams? If so, we currently have 46- I took the count from our management summary (everything that falls into commercial, including structuring and fundamentals.) If this is not what you are looking for, please give me a ring and I'll be happy to pull whatever you need. Thanks! (I'm sorry I took so long get back with you- I've been tied up all afternoon.)

Back in 99 it went from 4 to 29 I am guessing it now has about 20.

Trade Winds Blowing Enron Further South
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>

Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its high-profile energy trading operation. 
A billion-dollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant's second-quarter profits, which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company's well-publicized trading acumen. A smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge second-quarter numbers past Wall Street earnings estimates. One energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated. Complicating matters, Enron's financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings. 
For its part, Enron flatly denies that it used one-time gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impaired-assets sale was inflated. But dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for Houston-based Enron, which has long told investors that trading is its future. By shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation's fast-growing energy market, Enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years. Operating earnings from trading surged 160% in 2000 to $1.6 billion, causing the stock to double. 
Now there's chatter that Enron's swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter's unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities. In addition, the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit. If asset sales can't be repeated and trading income weakens, earnings could crater, observers say, which could pull Enron's already battered stock down even lower. 
In fact, fear that Enron's prodigious profits growth won't be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year. Other factors have contributed as well: Investor dissatisfaction over Enron's opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year, and earlier this month CEO Jeff Skilling quit after only six months on the job. Skilling's departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move. 
Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who has now reassumed the CEO post, said this week that he aims to improve Enron's disclosure. He has moved to allay concerns over top-level instability by promoting two experienced Enron executives to the positions of president, also vacated by Skilling, and vice chairman. 
But skeptics remain unconvinced. "I think the second-quarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales," says Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Street, a Cambridge, Mass.-based stock analysis firm that doesn't do underwriting. (Off Wall Street issued a critical report on Enron in May.) For the quarter, Enron made 45 cents a share, 3 cents more than analysts had expected. 
Details, Details
One transaction investors want details on is the sale by Enron North America of three gas-fired power plants to Allegheny Energy Supply, a unit of Allegheny Energy (AYE:NYSE - news - commentary) , Hagerstown, Md. The deal took place in May for a price of $1.05 billion, according to Allegheny's recent Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures. (Allegheny declined to comment on the deal.) 
Enron's second-quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so-called peaker plants, says Roberts. He believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as $500 million. An energy company analyst at a Wall Street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to $300 million. (His firm hasn't done recent underwriting for Enron.) 
Enron's financial statements don't specify the size of the gain from the peakers, so called because they supply power when demand is strong. The company declines to offer a number, saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold. 
However, Enron's public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales-and-services line, which is by far the biggest contributor to Enron's earnings, producing $762 million in operating profits in the second quarter. 
The problem is that the firm's trading profits also are booked in this segment. As a result, investors can't know how much of the quarter's blowout commodity sales-and-services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading. If Roberts' $500 million estimate is correct, trading may have accounted for only $262 million in second-quarter operating profit. 
Partners Indeed
The other deal that's raising eyebrows is the sale in June by Enron of Texas-based assets that are used to produce MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether), the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently. 
The assets were sold for $120 million by one subsidiary of Enron to another subsidiary, called EOTT Energy Partners (EOT:NYSE - news - commentary) , chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil. Any gain on the sale would have been booked in Enron's wholesale line. 
The issues with the deal are plenty. It took place on June 30, right at the end of the second quarter. This could be construed as a sign that Enron pressed EOTT to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second-quarter results. 
Then there's the question of price. Enron took a $440 million impairment charge against these MTBE assets at the end of 1999, responding to what it described at the time as "significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of MTBE." Some environmental authorities believe MTBE to be a dangerous substance and claim the MTBE content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels. 
Skeptics ask: How can Enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for $120 million? 
In addition, an executive at another energy company that talked to Enron about buying the MTBE assets claims they're worth $50 million at most; he claims Enron has long been trying to sell them for around $150 million. 
Put bluntly, did Enron stuff EOTT with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations? 
An Enron spokeswoman responds: "EOTT views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business. It makes good business sense." 
And a recent EOTT SEC disclosure states that EOTT's audit committee, made up of three directors who aren't employees or officers of any Enron affiliate, as well as an investment bank, judged the sale price to be fair. However, the chairman of the audit committee, Daniel Whitty, is a director for two other Enron subsidiaries. He declined to comment on the deal. 
A person familiar with Enron's business adds that it was EOTT that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third-quarter numbers. 
This person also says the gain was "immaterial" to Enron's second-quarter numbers, since there wasn't a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold. Most important, this person insists, the $120 million price isn't based only on the assets sold. EOTT is also paying for a contract with Enron that gives EOTT 10 years' worth of MTBE-related business. What's more, Enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in MTBE production, this person states. 
Whatever the case with the MTBE assets, Enron would go a long way toward fulfilling Lay's promises of glasnost by breaking out asset-sale gains. "They need to put their disclosure where their mouth is," concludes Off Wall Street's Roberts.

Louise --

My recommendation for an approval process for EnTouch is as follows:

1)	The deadline to provide information for that week's issue of EnTouch will be Wednesday at 12:00 pm.  All information submitted after that time will be held until the following week.
2)	A draft of EnTouch will be forwarded to each business unit head (or their designee) and commercial group head (or their designee), who has a Business Highlight or other information appearing in that particular issue.  E-mail, phone or in-person approval will be required from either a business unit head (or their designee) or commercial group head (or their designee) prior to distribution to Enron Messaging Administration on Thursday at 2:00 pm.
3)	If approval is not received prior to the deadline, the Business Highlight or other information will be pulled until approval is received.
4)	In the event a business unit or commercial group provides information that crosses business unit or commercial group lines, all affected business units and commercial groups will receive the draft and a representative of each involved party will be required to approve per instruction # 2.

I believe this process will alleviate the two problems that have occurred over the past few months.  Please advise.

Additionally, I have attached the list of contacts Kathie uses for gathering EnTouch information.  It includes the primary contacts and their secondary contacts.  Please feel free to comment on this list.

Thanks.

Eric

Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. 
The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. 
Transportation 
The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. 
Video 
You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).
Please find attached the following information: 
(i) Attendees and Teams for Video 
(ii) Draft Agenda 
Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) 
We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek. 
John & Louise

I heard about the videos at your offsite and I'm hoping people will take your lead.  VHS shot on someone's Sony will be great!  Innovision has also agreed to work with any team to simply provide editing services for them.

As for the $10,000 figure ... I was concerned that if "outsourcing" wasn't an option, we wouldn't get many entries.  But the cheaper the better -- there will be recognition given to the best "independently produced" video.

Thanks for your input and I hope Enron Americas will have a submission.

You should give zero budget for videos, not 10,000.  We did this for our offsite and it worked fine.

Subject:	Enron Management Conference - Home Video Project


The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

Thanks for the positive feedback - I'm glad everything went well.  When I called Kristen & Rich on Thursday evening - it sounded like everyone was having a grand time!!
Trip to Germany was fun, but hectic.  It's hard to put so much into only 10 days.
Looking forward to handling your next event (and this time I'll make sure I'm in town).
By the way - how did the videos turn out??

Please find the latest draft of the Wholesale pitch included below as an attachment.

I have included front portion, Americas and Europe sections.

The only data point I am lacking at this point relates to our East Power slide regarding #  of Term MW's.  I am working with Leslie Reeves on obtaining this information.  I expect the wording on the RTO's slide may change a bit once Gov. Affairs provides their final comments; however, this draft includes most of the content.

Following our discussion this morning, you may have some comments on Slide 14 (Recent Structured Transactions).  This slide was modeled after your Board presentation.  We can add/delete information as you desire.  

I am working on modifying the conference call script language and will forward to you shortly.

Thanks again for your help.

Regards.

FYI - an excerpt from today's Simmons note on ENE's conf. call from Friday
that summarizes their view of Enron.  If you'd like to listen to the call, 
it can be accessed on the www.enron.com website under "Investors".

Jeff Dietert, Simmmons, will be joining Craig Albert in the meeting Tues. afternoon
I am headed to NYC on Tuesday for marketing.  Joining Craig and Jeff from Enron IR
will be Scott Vonderheide and David Leboe (David is new to IR from Wes Colwell's structuring
group).  Pls. call if you have anything you'd like to discuss prior to the meeting.  
Thanks, Paula




SUMMARY:  ENE held a conference call primarily to confirm that its business
units are on-track and to dispel some rumors in the marketplace.  ENE
reiterated its FY01 EPS guidance of $1.70-$1/75, which we consider to be
conservative (consensus is $1.74/sh, SCI-$1.80/sh).  ENE did not discuss
any change to 1Q01 EPS expectations (guidance $0.40-$0.45/sh, consensus
$0.45, SCI $0.43/sh).  Many of ENE's comments concerning the wholesale
energy trading confirm comments we are consistently getting from all the
energy convergence players.  The California situation is forcing utilities
across the country to deal with risk exposure to avoid a PG&E/Edison
situation.  Most utilities and other gas/electricity consumers are not
prepared to manage these risk and are now outsourcing energy management
activities to sophisticated marketing companies.  In addition, new
generation facilities are offering gas marketing opportunities.  ENE is
clearly the leader in energy marketing, trading & risk management.  There
are a few other sophisticated MT&RM companies (DYN, EPG, WMB, DUK, MIR,
Aquila), but there is a huge drop in sophistication below these top tier
marketers.  We believe the vast majority of the opportunity is being
captured by these few strong players.  ENE is expecting 1Q01 natural gas
volumes to be up 25% to 30% and electricity volumes to be up 25% to 50%
over 1Q00.

OPINION:  It is tough to get excited about buying a 30x multiple stock is a
market as ugly as the one we are currently experiencing.  However, ENE is
the leader in energy convergence and should be a part of any growth and/or
energy portfolio.  There are few opportunities to build a position in the
stock at reasonable valuations and we believe ENE's current valuation is
very attractive (31x FY01, 26x FY02).   Business fundamentals are quite
strong and ENE is benefiting from a market where tight energy markets
encourage customers to focus on large, well-established suppliers for their
energy requirements.

CLEARING UP THE NOISE:
   EBS LAYOFFS.  Rumors have circulated that ENE was laying off employees
   in its Broadband segment and even that it was disbanding its Broadband
   business.  We expect ENE to continue to build the Intermediation and
   Content Services units.  ENE expects to build its Network with a larger
   percentage of contracted capacity than previously expected and reduced
   its capital expenditure expectations from $750 million this year to $250
   million.  The reduced activity in building out the Network is
   contributing to reduced staffing requirements in the Network area.
   PGE DIVESTITURE.  CEO Jeff Skilling placed only a 5% probability on the
   completion of the $1.7 billion PGE sale to Sierra Pacific.  The PGE
   asset is likely to continue as part of the ENE portfolio in the
   near-term.  We had previously considered PGE to be a discontinued
   business.  PGE EPS contributions will be marginally positive to FY01 EPS
   expectations.
   INDIA GENERATION.  ENE's Dabhol, India power project (826 MW) is
   experiencing a similar crisis to the one in California.  The electricity
   purchaser of the power generated by Dabhol is backed by the Indian
   government, but has not been able to pass through the increased cost of
   power caused by higher oil prices.  ENE has been relying on the
   guarantee from the Indian government for payment for its electricity
   sales. ENE has continued to receive payment from he government but is
   subject to regulatory risks for this project.
   CALIFORNIA CREDIT EXPOSURE.  We believe ENE is managing its credit risk
   appropriately.

Subject:	Macro Questions

Is the country facing sustained tight markets?:
In general, capacity margins have been falling over the last few years as utilities have refraind from building baseload capacity, and others have focused on developing primarily peaking capacity.  The last large building boom of coal plants ended in early 1970's and nuclear boom dropped sharply after Three Mile Island incident in 1979.  During 1990's, projected capacity margins have fallen from the 15 - 20 % toward 10% and below.  Outside of the California situation,   NYC also poses a potential risk for this summer.
If general, however, by 2002 - 2003, the amount of capacity proposed in each region more than covers normal load growth for meeting peak hour demand.  Remaining question relates to performance of existing coal and nuclear stacks, also what happens during periods of persistent drought.

Will voaltility and prices remain high or lessen?:
To the extent that more capacity becomes merchant oriented focusing in marginal cost economics, and transmission congestion persists, increased volatility will continue, especially in ISO/pool type environments.  Prices will reflect primary fuel dynamics, especially the interplay between gas and oil.  The case for lower prices will reflect an overbuild scenario beyond this year, coupled with slowing economic activity and low incidence of extreme weather events. 
 
How fast can generation be added and what returns should be expected?
The variability in development of greenfield capacity depends on time to permit at state or local levels.  Construction time is fairly constant.  In general 18 months is reasonable time frame from concept to first fire.  To the extent that power plants are project financed with minimum 30 equity, returns should be consistent with other comparable project financed opportunities available to fund managers.  We do not expect any more fully debt financed facilities in the near term.

Can companies make major profits owning generation long term?
Above average returns over time will reflect superior plant management skills and effective use of strategic market information.  Portfolio approach will aid in this case.   If an oversupply situation occurs in the 2003-05 timeframe, significantly lower returns on capital could materialize.

Is this the time to sell generation?
Because of recent market events in west, capacity has higher than historically observed 
values.  Depending on overbuild scenario this may be an attractive time to sell capacity to those still in queue or hoping to build in near term.  Recent pool experience shows that capacity owners still have significant market power

How will supply demand balance change in various regions of country? 
Weather normalized demand growth fairly consistent at 2 - 3 % on average overtime.  Future dynamics depend on economic growth, which suggests more load on coastal and in tech-concentrated areas.  Short-term demand reflects weather dynamics (year 2000 a non-event for Eastern interconnect, opposite in the West!).  Aggressive capacity growth suggested in NEPOOL, ERCOT, ECAR, MAIN and SPP over next two years. 

Will natural gas continue to capture all the growth?
Virtually all capacity due on line is gas fired, however, incremental supply growth could come from investments in existing coal and nuclear stack, which can be more economic.

Marketing?
Growth business will appear as more interaction solicited from enduser, and rates can become more dynamic.

Too late for new entrants?
Most states still do not have switching of energy service providers, so still time to enter.  Barriers to entry include capabilities in brand management, retail marketing, effective integration of risk management and billing ability.

Will only handful of customers be big winners?
To the extent economies of scale and aggregation opportunities exist, there will be success to larger players but not to exclusion of niche player existance.

How diffentiated are the strategies?
To date marketing is focused on lower rates and giving an alternative to existing service provider.  This will have to develop beyond that.

How significant is the retail opp?
In markets where retail rates are high, order of magnitude limited to 10's of dollars/mwh.  However gives opportunity to trade around, similar to supply asset.

Political/Security Update:

	Headlines

?	Taliban to declare "Jihad" against the US if Afghanistan targeted; heightening expectations for retaliatory attacks against US targets.
?	Bush stokes unease among allies and international press with call for Bin Ladin to be brought to the U.S., "dead or alive."
?	Taliban offers to deliver Bin Ladin to a third country, likely a Muslim country.  Offer almost certain to be rejected by Bush Administration.
?	FBI arrests five additional suspected hijackers; raising expectations for further attacks
?	U.S. officials to meet with Saudi Foreign Minister in Washington; questions to be asked about involvement of sons of Saudi diplomat in attacks

	Analysis

?	Efforts by the Bush Administration to build a multilateral coalition against terrorism will have to address two key foreign policy issues: Iraq and the Israel-Palestinian peace process.  Missteps in either area could weaken the emerging multilateral coalition against terrorism and have important implications for the oil market. 
?	For a multilateral approach to work in the long term, the Administration will need to provide countries with incentives to cooperate in the anti-terrorism campaign, especially in places such as the moderate Arab states where dismantling the networks suspected of supporting terrorist groups will involve moving against internal targets. Moreover, the Administration will need to deal with the root causes that provide willing cadres to extremist groups, especially economic problems and political disenfranchisement. Dealing with all of these factors will necessitate US financial support as well as greater US imagination in dealing with lingering regional issues.

Policy towards Iraq.

?	Washington appears to be resisting attempts to broaden its attacks to include Iraq at this point, despite internal and external pressure for such action. This will be a leading indicator, assuming that no firm proof of Baghdad's involvement in the bombings is uncovered. A more aggressive US approach towards Iraq has seemed likely since July when Moscow blocked the introduction of "smart sanctions" during the last rollover of the Oil-for-Food program. 
?	However, given regional sensitivities in the Arab world to Washington's Iraq policy and the interests that states such as Russia and to a lesser extent China have in the country, the Bush Administration cannot have both a genuinely multilateral approach to anti-terrorism and an unilateral hard-line Iraqi policy. It will need to chose between one or the other. 

Israeli-Palestinian peace process. 

?	Without an equitable solution to this conflict, most experts believe that the Bush team's anti-terrorism coalition is doomed to failure. 
?	Initially, at least, the signs are not good: the Sharon government in Israel has been resistant to US pressure to rein in its aggressive policies towards the Palestinians
?	Washington's willingness to confront Israel on this issue will give a clue to its willingness to stay the anti-terrorism course and hold its broad coalition together.

Market Update:

US Equities: 
?	Next 48 hours seen as critical after yesterday's losses and Fed cut.  8750 on Dow seen as key resistance point: looking for decisive close below 8750, not just intra-day test.  Downside risk seen to 7500 if the 8750 area doesn't hold: 7500 key b/c it was the nadir of Asian crisis.
?	Two Wildcards: Company Warnings: Will the torrent continue?  (Slight positive coming out of Oracle); War: Issue remains scope, duration.
Asia Overnight:
?	Bank of Japan, with little headline opportunities to ease, but after much speculation and criticism did cut its discount rate 15bps to .1% from .25% late in Tokyo today.  The Nikkei closed up 175.47.
Europe:
?	Equities: European markets are down (as of 0630 CDT) uniformly around 2% but most of the losses were at the opening with stability since. 
?	Currencies: US$ steady in European trading with marginal gains against most currencies.  There may be uncertainty about the $ but conversations over the last two days uniformly confirm that there is no renewed confidence in the Euro.  The Swiss Franc continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the crisis.
?	Central Banking:  The Bank of England MPC decided to cut this afternoon, but only 25bps: less and later than expected.  The monthly inflation numbers complicated the picture with a higher than expected rise, rising +.4% in Aug and now +2.6% annual, rising above government target of +2.5% for the first time in 28 months.  
?	European airlines: Mirroring American counterparts' woes in today's trading: KLM issued a profit warning, Virgin cut jobs, Alitalia appealed for government assistance; all airlines are off in trading , though not as badly as in US

Infrastructure

	Nuclear Power

?	Delegates from 132 nations opened the annual International Atomic Energy Agency conference Monday with calls for tighter security - and admissions that little can be done to shield a nuclear power plant from an airborne assault.
?	The architects of the world's nuclear plants designed them more with ground vehicle - not airborne - attacks in mind. 
?	The buildings that house nuclear reactors themselves are far smaller targets than the Pentagon posed, and it would be extremely difficult for a terrorist to mount a direct hit at an angle that could unleash a catastrophic chain of events

John, as a follow up to Greg's call, I would like to provide equity value, in recognition of the huge effort on the EES issues plus key player on the team going forward, to the following people from EES:

                                Options Equity          Total

        Rogers Herndon  $250K           $250K           $500K

        Don Black               $250K           $250K           $500K

        Jeff Richter            $100K           $100K           $200K

When are we going to get back together to finalize our discussions?

Per our conversation this morning, attached is the revised rooming list.
Also, below is the description of the mountain biking.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.
 

SATURDAY ACTIVITY
MOUNTAIN BIKING (10:00 am - 2:00 pm)
Each guest will be provided with a mountain bike (equipped with full front and rear suspension), helmet and a trail map.  Pedal toe clips are available upon request.  Included in this activity is a full day pass on the Centennial Chair Lift (a four person detachable quad) located at the main base of Beaver Creek Mountain.  Trails are clearly marked and are categorized in the following manner:
Green - Beginner
Blue - Intermediate
Black Diamond - Advanced
The green and blue trails are wide dirt roads.  The black diamond routes are single track trails.
It takes approximately 25 minutes to complete an intermediate trail; 15 minutes for the chair lift and 10 minutes for the bike trail.  Guests are at their leisure to tackle as many trails as they wish.
Guides will be provided along the various routes for assistance and bike maintenance.

I don't have all the facts to agree or disagree.  Until John Z has approval to trade currency, I wouldn't think you would want to go down this path.  In addition, I'm sure  you know hegding currency this big and late of Fridays is tough.

Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on Enron Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.

Subject:	Organizational Changes - East Power

We are pleased to announce that Dave Duran will replace Janet Dietrich to co-lead the East Power Wholesale business at Enron.  Dave will continue to run the highly successful Generation Investments business.

The East Power team will continue to have a single income statement and joint accountability toward its financial goals as was set out in the reorganization in late 2000.

Within Dave's Generation Investments group; Michael J. Miller will lead the effort to acquire new QF projects, Chuck Ward will lead the restructuring efforts on existing QF projects, and Carl Tricoli will lead the initiative to develop and market capital products to IPP's.  In addition, Mitch Robinson will lead a new initiative to evaluate opportunities with coal fired generation.  Dave and Kevin Presto will attempt to leverage the Generation Investments business and the Origination activities through a tighter integration between the two groups.

Dave has over nine years of direct experience in gas and power origination at Enron including an outstanding performance over the last couple of years building the Generation Investments business.  He also spent two years managing Enron's Retail Gas Marketing business in Dublin, Ohio.

The East Power group has had a great start to the year and we feel confident that the leadership team of Kevin and Dave will lead to continued success.

I think it would be a great idea if we could get a few extra spaces for
IT support in the new building.

We would need five spots.

Two for Enpower (one for risk, and one for volume mangement and confirms)
Two for Unify (one for logistics and one for EDI)
One for Gas Risk

I won't make requests for specific personnel (yet)  just not the most junior
personnel. 


Let me know if you need anything else.

thanks

bob

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

FYI - I'm taking in the Fed-Ex shipment now.  Also, we got the EnronOnline folders - you were right (again).  Torrey has finished his analysis and we can discuss those with you whenever you have time.

As we prepare for the kick-off of Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, Building Houston's Future, we are asking our top-level executives to set the standard of giving during the Leadership Giving Campaign that will run from July 23 through August 3.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers, so our adopted agencies were selected with flood relief in mind. Each business unit is also adopting United Way Scholars students, who will participate in the Days of Caring. United Way Scholars builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.

Last year, your generosity took Enron to new heights. We raised $2.8 million, which was 21 percent higher than our original goal. In order for Enron to achieve even greater success this year, we invite you to join us in becoming a member of the prestigious Alexis de Tocqueville Society by making a pledge of $10,000 or more to United Way.  

You are invited to join us at an Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. to learn more about the Society and hear about Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign plans.

The Breakfast will be held at the Center for the Retarded at 3550 West Dallas. Center for the Retarded is one of Enron's four adopted agencies for the 2001 campaign. Transportation from the Enron Building to The Center will be provided; however, if you prefer to drive yourself, we will send out directions a few days prior to the breakfast. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores at ext. 3-3908 or zulie.flores@enron.com by Thursday July 26.

Leadership giving solicitation officially begins on Monday, July 23, so look for an e-mail on Monday morning with more information about the overall campaign and how to make your pledge on-line. If you have any questions about the Alexis de Toqueville Society, or about this year's campaign, please contact Kathy Mayfield, Enron's United Way Campaign Coordinator, at 713-853-3264 or Kathy.Mayfield@enron.com. 

At 49 Society members last year, Enron had the highest number of members in the city, and ranked nationally in the top 25 companies for total membership. We want to thank you for your generosity as this truly indicates how giving each of you are. 

Your support is needed more than ever and is the key to surpassing our campaign goals for 2001. We look forward to seeing you at breakfast on the 31st.

I think the concern is around Scott Mills. He was brought down to accelerate the mid/back-office fixes for EES, primarily as it relates to system changes/improvements. We're bringing Anthony Dayao back from Japan to head up EES IT and he'll be leaning on Scott quite a bit I believe. 

How does your schedule look later today or tomorrow? I would like to sit down for a few minutes to discuss the status of the EOL products for EES/ENA and also to talk a little bit about some customer overlap between the two groups and how to handle it. I'll have Kay set up some time for us.

I just thought I'd drop a note about the trip.  I think it was the best Enron offsite I have attended.  I thought the focus on interacting was very good and worked better than past golfing events and Vegas trips.  The event was also very well organized and the host/hostess were excellent. 

Thank you.

Cheers
Kyle

Thanks, I really appreciate the feedback.  

In the narrative discussion accompanying the presentation we will articulate the timeframe.

The Rockies pre-build transaction refers to the Fountain Valley Project (PSCO taking MW's; Equity Flip to Black Hills).

We are still working on the Americas section of the conference call script.  I will forward to you as soon as it becomes available.

Kind Regards.

The only comment  on the structures transaction slide is that 

(i) They are not from this quarter 
(ii) the Rockies Power - prebuild, I am not entirely sure what this deal is - but there was one in Washington.
(iii) REmove MidWest Gas Utility Outsourcing as we haven't completed this yet - hopefully you can have it for Q4.
(iv) Price Risk Management is your call - its really just trading.

Please find the latest draft of the Wholesale pitch included below as an attachment.

I have included front portion, Americas and Europe sections.

The only data point I am lacking at this point relates to our East Power slide regarding #  of Term MW's.  I am working with Leslie Reeves on obtaining this information.  I expect the wording on the RTO's slide may change a bit once Gov. Affairs provides their final comments; however, this draft includes most of the content.

Following our discussion this morning, you may have some comments on Slide 14 (Recent Structured Transactions).  This slide was modeled after your Board presentation.  We can add/delete information as you desire.  

I am working on modifying the conference call script language and will forward to you shortly.

Thanks again for your help.

Regards.

I sent you another one - it adresses your views.  I would not add foster.  In fact I would add Lagrasta and Baughman first.  Maybe we should do 35.

With Calger leading the likes of Parquet etc they can make $100mm plus - without him no chance.  I think it's sort of indirect p&l.
 
I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.  Harry, Orlando and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.
 
Let's not stick to 30 - let's do 33 putting Miller,Deffner, Foster, Zipper, Ermis and Aucoin in.  Daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list.

my order is actually future p\l based.  if it wasn't in enron n.a. i would put calger way higher.  ie - if it was pulp and paper and i knew that we wouldn't have the opportunity to trade size, chris would be in the top 3.  Maybe 1.  But in this market we need to have the people who can make over 100 MM every year.  just thinking.

I didn't get a copy of Dave's email but a few comments and I attach a compromise ordering.  I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Our differences are:
Me - Don Miller, Joe Deffner,Chris Foster
You - Zipper, Ermis, Aucoin
 
I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.
 
Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey? 
 
I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Speak to you later.

The Enron Building in Houston will be closed for the rest of the day.  The offices in New York and Washington, D.C. have also been closed, and all employees have been accounted for.  We're asking all Houston-based employees not involved in critical operations to go home to be with their families.  We have every reason to believe the Enron Building is safe and secure.  Each Enron location has the discretion to determine what is in the best interest of their employees.  We know of no Enron employee or facility affected by today's tragic events.  Let's keep all the victims of these tragedies in our thoughts and prayers.  

If you have information that you believe may be relevant to this matter, please email john.brindle@enron.com <mailto:john.brindle@enron.com>.  For updates, view http://www.enron.com/corp/usbombingcrisisupdate.

I have been working with my national sales representative from the Four Seasons Hotel to minimize our contract obligations from our cancellation of the New York Customer Holiday Event dated November 30 - December 2, 2001.

The contract states that if Enron should cancel the entire event within 90 days - 61 days prior to the scheduled commencement date of the event, Enron would be liable for 50% of the hotels liquidated damages, which is estimated at $28,218.

After numerous conversations with the hotel, they have agreed to accept our initial deposit of $15,000 as full payment for the cancellation of this event.  No additional costs will be charged to Enron.  I believe that this is a fair offer and hope that all parties involved find this acceptable.

In the meantime, I received a call from Laura Luce this morning and she is interested in continuing this event on a much reduced scale.  The Four Seasons is willing to hold our initial reservation, with no additional penalties, until we can confirm if we would like to proceed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.

Geoff,

It was nice meeting and chatting with you (albeit briefly) about
EnronOnline and other markets in which Enron participates (not to
mention our li'l chat about English clothes  :-)

Just wanted to send you a note reiterating the offer to answer any
questions you may have regarding EnronOnline or Enron.  Having gone
through the development process of EnronOnline and some of the other
initiatives within Enron,  Louise and/or I should be able to provide you
with insights in case you have questions.

Regards,

Delainey and I started initial discussions reguarding EES and the customers and products they plan to market.  These were initial discussions.   Dave is writing something up to send to me.  Before I agree on anything I will talk to all of you.  Some of the meeting that are happening may be a little premature.

Enron Appeals for Calm in US Natural Gas and Power Markets
 
      Enron appealed today for calm in US natural gas and power markets.  Enron will be available to buy and sell natural gas and power both over the phone and through its online platform Enrononline.
 
      "We see no reason for gas and power markets to panic in the aftermath of yesterday's tragedies," said Greg Whalley, President and Chief Operating Officer.  "These are domestic commodities and the physical infrastructure is secure and operating."
 
     Enrononline will be open for gas and power transactions from 7:00 am to 12:00 noon, CDT to enable market participants to make purchases and sales and adjust their positions as necessary.

I'm not close enough right now to the discussion. There is a mtg/conf call scheduled for tomorrow to go into details on these ercs and determine how we spin them to the bank. Barclays will be back tomorrow on whether they can proceed with rolling the existing so2 credits and at what price. I will call when I can. On call with s&p now.

Welcome back, again.  You will have to let me know when you have baby pictures in the office - would love to see them.  

Last week, I orchestrated some changes within my operations organization which will free up more of my time to focus on the successful commercialization of mid and back office services.  I have asked Bob Hall to lead operations for Enron Americas, with Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary operations), Jeff Gossett (Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (Power Risk) and Leslie Reeves (Confirmations and Settlements) reporting directly to him.  He is enthusiastic about the additional responsibility and I believe that he will do an excellent job for Enron Americas.  

Other changes include appointing Kevin Sweeney as head of operations for EIM, with Brenda Herod reassigned as part of a project team that will work on the EES assimilation.  I have also asked Beth Apollo to play a project management lead role in the assimilation of EES into EWS.  

I will be glad to fill you in on more details on any of these changes.  The result is to give more responsibility to several key players - stretching them, but I will be there to support and coach them in their new roles if needed.  Plus, I can now devote significantly more time to the commercialization effort.  In that regard, I did move to the 27th floor (next to Piper) while you were out on leave.  

I wanted to share these changes with you before a memo goes out across the organization next Monday.  Call me if you would like to discuss.  --Sally

Update as of 0730CDT.

A.	Market Updates

U.S. Markets/Economic Updates

?	US equity markets expected to reopen Monday.  The SEC has announced it will allow coordinated buyback schemes to "ensure an orderly market" in the event of a market freefall upon Monday's opening.  The SEC is also expected to strongly restrict short-selling.
?	NYMEX closed Friday; ACCESS trading uncertain
?	CBOT/CME open Friday; full trading except for equity futures
?	Standard & Poor says the insurance system will be able to absorb up to $50 billion in losses from the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre.  Insurable losses of over $8 billion - $13 billion will dent individual insurers' balance sheets, it said. It emerged that only one of the World Trade Centre's towers was insured, because the possibility of a double accident was thought too improbable.

Europe
?	Brent Crude is trading up a $1.42 at $29.80 (0730CDT) on market anxiety about the possibility of imminent military operations in the Middle East.
?	In a probable preview of the NYSE opening on Monday, European equities' losses were spearheaded by sliding airline shares like British Airways, down 13 percent, and Alitalia, down 7.5 percent, as flights remained disrupted for a fourth day. The FTSE was down 1.7%, the CAC-40 down 2.67%, and the DAX was down 3.87% at 0715CDT.

FOREX

?	The dollar is down against the Euro at 0.9230 (0730CDT), as concerns over the status of the US economy are mounting, fueled in large part by bearish comments from European central bankers and politicians:
o	EU's Solbes: "The possibility of recovery in the third quarter in the U.S. will be more reduced."
o	SNB's Roth: "Signs of an upturn in the cycle are not yet discernablein the US."
o	ISAE's Padoa-Schioppa: "U.S. attacks will squeeze economic growth and fuel inflation next year." 

?	The bearish comments reconfirm the apparent lack of effective communications coordination among G7 leaders.  However, further steep currency declines should lead to coordinated intervention.

B.	Transportation/Infrastructure Updates

Gas/Power/Nuclear Infrastructure

?	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to issue notationally an order that would allow interstate natural gas pipelines to roll into their rates the costs of security upgrades, according to industry sources cited by Natural Gas Intelligence. 
?	Tuesday's destruction of the World Trade Center has forced Montana Power Co. to delay its shareholder vote on the sale of its natural gas and power distribution assets for at least one week.

Refineries/Crude/Products

?	Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bingaman called on the FTC and Justice yesterday to monitor prices and prosecute any attempt to jack up races.
?	Senators discussed rigging gasoline prices at a Senate briefing yesterday, according to Sen. Conrad, who as you know chairs the Budget Committee.  He said Congress may take action soon to thwart any attempted price gouging.
?	Energy Sec. Abraham is encouraging consumers who encounter "unjustified prices" at retail fuel sites to report it to a DOE hotline.

Air Travel	

o	As widely reported in the media last night, two armed groups were detained at New York airports last night.  The groups were believed to be conducting another effort to hijack US airliners.
o	Logan Airport remains closed until further notice.
o	JFK, La Guardia, and Newark Airports closed after last night's arrests.
o	Other national airports operating on extremely limited schedule.
o	The State Department issued yesterday a Worldwide Caution for all US travelers.  The messages advises that travelers:

	"?maintain a high level of vigilance and increase their security awareness?. Maintain a low profile, vary routes and times for all required travel, and treat mail and packages from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. American citizens are also urged to avoid contact with any suspicious, unfamiliar objects, and to report the presence of the objects to local authorities. Vehicles should not be left unattended and should be kept locked at all times."  

Political/Security Update

?	Taliban and bin Ladin operations in Afghanistan now the clear target; Taliban leaders vow revenge.
?	Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld recommended calling up members of the reserve, initially to help support the combat air patrols securing the skies over major American cities.  CABC believes that the reserve call-up will extend well beyond homeland defense and will include overseas deployments.
?	The political situation is growing more complicated as evidence mounts that nationals of the United Arab Emirates were involved in the attack.  The implication of these individuals from an oil-producing US ally raises the possibility of political sanctions or other non-military measures that could affect the oil market.
?	Congress, despite some misgivings from lawmakers over granting President Bush open-ended authority, moved to give the administration $40 billion to wage its antiterror initiative.  Again, CABC believes that $40 billion represents a sum big enough to cover operations well beyond simply improving homeland defense.

Enron Appeals for Calm in US Natural Gas and Power Markets
 
      Enron appealed today for calm in US natural gas and power markets.  Enron will be available to buy and sell natural gas and power both over the phone and through its online platform Enrononline.
 
      "We see no reason for gas and power markets to panic in the aftermath of yesterday's tragedies," said Greg Whalley, President and Chief Operating Officer.  "These are domestic commodities and the physical infrastructure is secure and operating."
 
     Enrononline will be open for gas and power transactions from 7:00 am to 12:00 noon, CDT to enable market participants to make purchases and sales and adjust their positions as necessary.

Scary yes, but how can you even consider it's reality?  How the hell do you
think they developed the film?  It's not likely, given their proximity to
the approaching plane, that they would have had a rat's ass chance in hell
of escape.  Use your noodle you MBA pencil neck!

Perhaps I should rephrase.  Do you wish for any work to continue on the ROC at this time, or shall we put it on the back burner for a couple of weeks?  If the ROC is to be operational in early 2002, any further efforts towards the project will begin to incur external costs.

Lloyd and Fred are working on a management briefing for you.  

Tammy

Louise, 
Do you want Lloyd and Fred to obtain construction drawings (CD's) so that a project estimate can be generated on the ROC?  The CD's will run between $25 - 45,000.

Thanks,
Tammy

Friends...

Chris Bartlett at Harvard presented (last week) the 2 most recent Enron cases he wrote to the "Harvard Program for Global Leadership".  This is an Exec Ed program for CXO's and Senior management from throughout the world. Chris called me today to say that the cases received outstanding reviews, and that the largely international CXO audience was both knowledgeable about, and very 'pro-Enron'!

Best!

--Christie.

	The resume for Jeff Huff was inadvertently dropped from the message we sent yesterday evening.  The resume is attached below for your convenience.  

Below are a few points for your review:

Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been a consultant dedicated to Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 
The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 
Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 
Thank you. 
Mike and Jeff

In the past few months, there have been protests at various Enron offices.  These protests have been primarily by consumer and other advocacy groups representing different energy interests.  Attached are security and public relations procedures to help you manage a protest should one arise at your facility.  Feel free to provide this document to leaders in your organization as appropriate.

Thank You.

USA:
Persistent problems chinking Enron's armor.
By C. Bryson Hull

04/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, April 12 (Reuters) - The teflon around energy and trading powerhouse
Enron Corp. is starting to show some scratches, as negative events over the
past few months from India to its broadband unit, begin to take their toll,
analysts say.

Make no mistake, Wall Street still sees the Houston-based giant as the energy
convergence sector leader. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call
still believe Enron will meet its earnings per share targets of $1.75 for 2001.
But the stock has dropped to its lowest levels since late 1999, a slide which
started with news that Enron's keystone broadband content deal with
Blockbuster Inc. had fallen apart.

The stock had traded in the mid-$80s as recently as February, before the stock
market's recent collapse and a string of negative news. On Friday, it traded
at $57.45 on the New York Stock Exchange, down $1.06 cents or 1.8 percent, and
well off its high of $90.56 last August.

"Their share price hasn't been bulletproof and that's what counts. They were
up pushing $90 and they're now in the $50s while the energy sector has done
quite well, so they have underperformed quite a bit and that doesn't seem
bulletproof to me," analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities said.

Meade said the price fall came as investors took the bad news out of Enron's
valuation, particularly in devaluing the broadband business.

"With broadband the market initially gave them full credit. But investors got
smart over the next year, and once you got some bad news out there, you could
argue that valuation was pulled," Meade said.

But the bad news neither starts nor ends there.

The latest negative item came Wednesday, when a California federal judge
ordered Enron to return the University of California and California State
University systems to direct power access, which Enron says will cost them $12
million a month.

The universities' lawsuit which claimed Enron Energy Services breached their
power management contract, could cast a shadow over the Houston-based
company's power risk management arm which recently saw a huge upsurge in
business involving similar multimillion dollar deals with large corporations.

Other bad news includes broadband layoff talk, failed water company spinoff
Azurix Inc.'s impending sell-off its North American assets, the failure of the
video on demand deal with Blockbuster, word that the $2 billion sale of
utility Portland General is unlikely to go through and continuing payment
problems at the Dabhol power plant in India.

That long-running dispute in India reared its head again on Monday. Enron
confirmed it issued a notice of political force majeure to the Maharashstra
State Electricity Board (MSEB), which has consistently defaulted on payments.

Force majeure is an event beyond the control of a contractual party that could
not have been prevented.

"It's one of the steps in the process of protecting our rights. It's one step,
but it's not the only step," Enron spokesman John Ambler said.

Enron has already invoked payment guarantees from the Indian national
government, but it has refused to cover MSEB's $21.9 million December bill
until Enron and MSEB settle another dispute over a fine. The MSEB wants the
$85.8 million fine, which it levied, to cover its outstanding bills.

LAYOFFS OR REDEPLOYMENTS?

Another nettling problem for Enron is news of trouble at Enron Broadband
Services (EBS), the cutting-edge unit that encompasses a nascent bandwidth
trading operation and a broadband content services business.

Most recently, Enron has had to answer questions about a reduction in the
number of employees at EBS because of the stock market's faltering confidence
in telecoms generally.

Two weeks ago, the company characterized word of layoffs at the broadband unit
as nothing more than an internal redeployment of staff to areas that were
growing at a higher rate.

"It's word games. Initially they said they were redeploying, and that was not
the word I heard from inside the company, but that was the way they put it.
It's probably a little of both," said analyst John Olson of Houston investment
house Sanders Morris Harris.

EBS spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly on Monday said 227 employees were leaving the
broadband unit to work in other areas of the company.

"Most of them have elected to go into the redeployment pool or are already
moved into corporate or another business," Kimberly said.

Kimberly did not have an exact figure on the number who have opted to take a
severance package, but characterized it as a small percentage.

It has been a rough few weeks for EBS, which also suffered from the
Blockbuster debacle. Last month, the two announced a mutual end to a 20-year
exclusive video on-demand deal, which had been considered a cornerstone of
EBS' content services push.

Dorie,

Tim Belden and I are looking into chartering a plane to fly 8 people from Portland.  The cost is approx $20K.  Commercial flights require two legs to Vail or a flight to Denver plus the drive.  Either would take 5-7hours each way. Lavorato said this was OK so long as we did not "break the bank" on the charter.

Updates below on Afghanistan campaign, key issues for energy/financial markets in "phase two"of campaign, Federal Reserve activity, and nuclear plant security.  

RJ

Special Forces/Low Intensity Campaign Underway

Sources agree that the U.S. military operation in Afghanistan has begun.  Indications of special forces activity were strongly signaled when Taliban forces shot down a U.S. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on Monday.  The UAV that was shot down, a Predator, has a range of less than 400 miles, suggesting that U.S. special forces are closing in on Afghanistan.

Special forces units are concentrating on intelligence gathering and targeting key bin Ladin installations, as well as attempting to locate bin Ladin himself. As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld noted yesterday, "there will not be a D-Day as such."  The Afghanistan campaign at least initially will not be like Desert Storm, where CNN cameras in Baghdad hotels offered real-time imagery of U.S. air strikes.  The first phases of this war are being fought largely in secret, punctuated intermittently by what little coverage the media can provide. The action in phase one includes night raids, a lot of small-scale special operations reconnaissance and, when necessary, direct contact raids. A large military strike using airpower is also forthcoming, but is unlikely to be reported in real-time.

Operational Security is Tight 
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said U.S. military officials will refuse to comment on anything that will endanger troops or operations.  "And anyone that does talk to any of you about that is breaking federal criminal law and should be in jail," Rumsfeld said. When asked if he would lie to the press to disguise U.S. military operations, Rumsfeld said "you never say never."
Next Phases of U.S. Campaign More Important to Markets
If US military action is limited to Afghanistan, any immediate spike in oil prices is unlikely to endure because such a limited attack will not directly impact oil supply. However, US officials have said that the war on terrorism will go far beyond Afghanistan, so markets will continue to exhibit some degree of uncertainty until further developments take place. 

In the short term, oil supplies would be most directly affected by strikes against Iraq.  But any spike might be short lived as OPEC has enough spare capacity to cover an Iraqi outage.  In the medium term, oil markets might express fears over regional stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf regions as a result of US military strikes and possible subsequent terrorist attacks.  

It is expected that Iraqi biological-chemical weaponry will receive considerable attention in the days ahead and as has been widely reported, there is a split in the Bush Administration over whether to include Iraq.  The Iraqi weapons of mass destruction capability is likely to once again complicate the rollover of the UN oil-for-food program in December, which could lead to the Iraqis removing their oil from the market independently of what is happening in Afghanistan.  Another key issue is whether the expected refugee crisis and rising Islamic radicalism will destabilize the nuclear-armed Pakistani government. 
 
Saudis Showing Increased Cooperation in Oil Policy and in Military Planning
After a brief furor when the Saudi government announced that the U.S. would not be able to expand its operations at the Prince Sultan Airbase near Riyahd, US-Saudi cooperation has improved.  The public announcement of the airbase prohibition had been a PR move by the Saudis to head off domestic accusations of handing blank checks to the USA. CENTCOM has subsequently transferred its Ops Command to Saudi Arabia.  In addition, the Saudis have responded to U.S. pressure by officially severing relations with the Taliban.

In Vienna, all indications are that the Saudis are working toward an OPEC agreement to keep the market well supplied with oil and to not take advantage of the political uncertainty affecting the crude markets by cutting production.  The most likely outcome is that OPEC will officially hold production at current levels, but agree to limited cheating to ensure adequate supply. Another possibility is that OPEC will lower the target range for the OPEC basket price that would take lower demand forecasts into account.  Either step would allow OPEC to preserve cohesion at a time of political and economic uncertainty.  If prices continue a rapid decline after the Vienna meeting, Washington and Riyadh might come up with a "politically correct" way to "spin" an output reduction by blaming market volatility on speculators rather than on OPEC.  The cartel is likely to reconvene in early November to reassess market conditions.

Fed Shifts Its Model To Adapt to New Economic Reality

The Fed is still struggling to answers for what recent events will do to the economy but it's clear that three elements of their model have fundamentally changed:

1. The most important is a significant drop in all aspects of individuals' and companies' risk tolerance, which must be reversed quickly. The Fed has done its bit by stabilizing the financial system and Congress is stepping in with a total stimulus package of $100-150 billion (Greenspan supports $100
bln). On the diplomatic/military side, the balanced, multilateral approach of the administration together with discreet pressure on OPEC to reduce prices is all designed to stabilize expectations and boost sentiment. 

2. On rates, while the Fed is expected to keep cutting (they won't disappoint the market), sources report that Greenspan is actually quite comfortable using liquidity to alter actual Fed Funds rather than changing official rates. However, the Fed governors are increasingly convinced that sentiment really depends on military success and they are even more aware than that they are running out of ammunition on the rate cutting side.

3. Despite Greenspan's protests we are looking at a fiscal boost that will push the budget to at least a 1% of GDP deficit.

Nuclear Plants Under Increased Security Scrutiny
The Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute and the Los Angeles-based Committee to Bridge the Gap urged the government to immediately station 30 to 40 National Guard troops around nuclear plants to protect them from attacks.  The watchdog groups also said the government should be prepared to deploy anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down attack planes. Another needed measure is to carefully re-check the background of all nuclear plant employees and contractors to prevent internal sabotage.

We are pleased to announce the following organizational changes:

Enron Global Assets and Services

In order to increase senior management focus on our international businesse=

 the former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS wi=
ll include Enron's assets and merchant activities in South America.  In ord=
er to ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant bu=
siness, John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities=
.  John will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merc=
hant business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services =
Office of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Execut=
ive Officer of Enron Americas.

Enron India

Enron's significant interests in India are commanding increased attention f=
rom Enron's senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca McD=
onald will focus exclusively on Enron's business in India, as Chief Executi=
ve Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chair=
man.

Enron Broadband Services

With Kevin's departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also mak=
ing a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be Pr=
esident and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Romano =
and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within =
their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Offic=
er of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of t=
he Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network=
 Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Offic=
e of the Chairman.


Enron Principal Investments

In order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities relat=
ed to Enron's core businesses, we are combining the existing investment gro=
ups in ENA, EBS, Enron Investment Partners and the Enron Special Asset Grou=
p into a single unit, Enron Principal Investments.  Enron Principal Investm=
ents will work with all Enron business units to identify, execute, and mana=
ge equity investments that leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledg=
e.  These investments may be in the form of venture capital, leveraged buy-=
outs, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.  This new b=
usiness unit will be headed by Kevin Garland, Managing Director, and will r=
eport to an investment committee consisting of Dave Delainey, Ken Rice, and=

s, we are consolidating these activities under Andy Fastow, Executive Vice =
President and Chief Financial Officer.  Jeff Donahue, Managing Director of =
Corporate Development for EBS will now head Corporate Development across En=
ron.  Corporate Development leaders in the business units will have a dual =
reporting relationship to their business units and to Jeff.

One of Enron's most compelling challenges is the sale of certain assets or =
businesses that are no longer core operations.  Mark Metts, Executive Vice =
President of Enron Corp., will head up a new Special Projects group to spec=
ifically focus on the completion of some of these more challenging transact=
ions. =20

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their new resp=
onsibilities.

Strategic Synopsis
September 21, 2001
10:30 AM

?	The presidential address last night confirmed that a major military mobilization is under way and that a long campaign is ahead, extending well beyond Afghanistan.  Not surprisingly, the speech did not clarify the timing of the attack.  
?	The president warned the Taliban that unless it handed over Osama bin Laden and the leaders of his al-Qaeda terrorist network, it would face devastating military action. "They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate," Bush told the US Congress.  So far, the Taliban are refusing to comply.
?	As such, U.S. military forces will strike in Afghanistan as soon as a target of opportunity presents itself.  As the President himself noted in his speech last night, some of the special forces operations will not be visible to the public, while other steps such as airstrikes will be dramatic and unmistakable.  Trying to figure out the precise timing of specific types of strikes is probably impossible at this point.  However, we safely state the following:
o	The President set the stage for a long conflict last night, and equity markets are anticipating significant economic pessimism.  Consumer confidence is likely to worsen if additional terrorist attacks are made against U.S. targets.
o	Our sources indicate that Bush spoke at length with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah this week, and Abdullah agreed to lower oil prices.  No specifics were discussed.   Preliminary information suggests that Saudi Arabia is carrying out extra liftings in the second half of September and moving crude cargoes closer to market.  
o	When the initial attack comes against Afghanistan, oil markets will likely see confirmation that no threat to crude oil supply is taking place.  But speculation about further strikes against other terrorist-sponsoring states should maintain a degree of uncertainty in the market. 
o	The war against terrorism will eventually have to deal with Iran and Iraq; both are major OPEC producers.  Persuading Iran to cooperate is more likely to involve diplomacy than force.   Some Administration officials, led by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, are pushing for a move against Baghdad.  So far, this group has been overruled by advocates of a more cautious approach, who realize that attacking Iraq will seriously undermine Arab support for the US.  
o	Washington also has to be concerned with stability in Pakistan, where much of the population (including senior military and intelligence figures) supports the Taliban.
o	Terrorist retaliation to the U.S. attacks appears to be likely.  Attempts to strike infrastructure targets, including energy facilities both here and overseas, are expected.
o    On the ground today, heavy fighting is raging in northern Afghanistan as opposition forces attack Taliban troops.  The Northern Alliance forces are taking advantage of US pressure on the Taliban to recapture key areas and avenge the recent death of their leader.

To all,

I'm on board with Kieth's comments.  I just want to make sure we are all relaying the same message to the ENA organization - dotted/solid line... whatever.   Also, we are going to have to sell the resulting structure/processes/division of responsibility to the ENA origination teams so that we don't create unnecessary divisions.   This has been the case in the past - something we have all been working hard to avoid.

Regards,
Brian

Louise,

I left a message with Brian after receiving his phone message this morning, but have not had a chance to talk with him.  I have told no one solid or dotted line. In response to a direct question from Bruce Golden in Brian's group about what the reference to Development Engineers meant in the announcement, I told him Development Engineers were "connected" to EEOS as a part to technical quality control from a corporate perspective.  With others, Brian Stanley and I have used the concept that the Development Engineers are aligned to the Business Units but seconded from EEOS.  This allows movement to best satisfy corporate needs if required.  We felt this approach fits our none profit center aligned to Wholesale charter. As you state, we still have to work the details of our role in support of the Wholesale Business Units.

Aside, I have the least concerns with Brian's group. With Brian, we have a focal point to communicate above the day-to-day chatter and navigate over the hurdles left stacked with EE&CC baggage.

Brian Stanley is planning to spend a couple of weeks here sorting these types of issues.

Keith Dodson

Until there is another agreement between the three of you the message is:

The technical staff in Enron Americas will continue to report on a straight line to Brian who will work out the nature of his dotted line to the new group in the future.

Let's keep the business as usual, no change message to avoid any further miscommunications until you all sit down together.

Thanks

Louise

Louise:

No - but they are probably a good candidate for the restructuring group.   They were originally 9 barges that were owned by CALME (D. Haug) and were being shopped around Enron for a home.   Some of them went to a power project in Nigeria and now their are two of them left without a home.  

Last year they were being considered for a LIPA deal on Long Island that was orginally proposed by R. Maffett/R. Tapscott.  Janet D. was working on this deal before she left for EES - but I don't think she made any further progress.  As I recall the ownership of the barges came from the CALME organization into Mike McConnell's - EGM group as part of the split of CALME assets.

Hi Louise,
Are you in agreement with these charges, and which team should I apply them to (trading teams vs OOC)?

Hi Edie!

I have attached two files that I received from Andrew Parsons for Enron America's headcount on the contingency floor. Per Andrew, he discussed this project, (which will provide traders with an alternative workspace should the need arise), with Louise Kitchen.  This expense project is being carried on Net Works books and will be allocated out to the business units using project settlement rules in the Project System module of SAP. This project will cover the period September  through December, 2001 and should cost approximately  $ 750K in total .  I will need a cost center or account or project, etc. to charge Enron America's share ( .270 for power and .402 for gas) of the costs.

Thank you for your prompt attention!

my order is actually future p\l based.  if it wasn't in enron n.a. i would put calger way higher.  ie - if it was pulp and paper and i knew that we wouldn't have the opportunity to trade size, chris would be in the top 3.  Maybe 1.  But in this market we need to have the people who can make over 100 MM every year.  just thinking.

Our differences are:
Me - Don Miller, Joe Deffner,Chris Foster
You - Zipper, Ermis, Aucoin
 
I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.
 
Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey? 
 
I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Speak to you later.

Absolutely.  I was stuggling before, but I'm completely re-energized now that I'm able to take the conference a whole new direction.  I'm so glad the agenda is still rather open.  It's really fortunate.

I'd welcome any ideas given the changes.

Hi Louise,

Congratulations on your baby and welcome back.  

I'm preparing the agenda for Enron's annual management conference again this year.  I was hoping I could ask for your insight as I'm compiling the program.

This year's conference theme plays off of our new vision, "Becoming the World's Leading Company."  However, the feeling at Enron is quite different this year because of the depressed stock price, California, India, Broadband, etc.  I'd welcome your thoughts on what the tone for the conference should be, i.e. subdued optimism, reenergizing, etc.

On a related subject, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling will both have an hour on the agenda to speak.  This is in response to feedback from employees saying they want to hear more from each of them.  Afterall, they are both top notch industry speakers.  Rather than have them give a current "state of the company" address, I intend to have them focus on bigger company, industry or market topics.  I'd love your thoughts on this as well.  (I believe Jeff needs to lay out a plan for achieving our vision, and as an economist, Ken could give valuable insight into what's happening in the market.)

Finally, I'd welcome any ideas for an outside corporate speaker.  I'd very much like to have someone from a corporation that 1.) Enron people admire; and 2.) has undergone some difficult period in their company's history.  Jeff personally extended an invitation to Steve Ballmer from Microsoft, but he is unable to attend.  Is there someone you think would be interesting?

I truly appreciate any consideration you can give this issue.  I look forward to your thoughts and ideas.

	Please see the attached file that reflects the multiple for each asset sale.  As you can see for assets that had losses, we show no multiple.  Additionally, there are some assets that have no EBITDA at all (that we are aware of), thus we show no multiple.  Please let me know if this is what you expected.  Thanks!

Sunday race event tickets located in Grandstand C, just before turn one and adjacent to the PacWest Summit
Special PacWest driver autograph and "meet and greet" sessions for Enron guests

Wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in ea=
ch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=
 week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=
le availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=
hedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=
o hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=
ot been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =
that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=
 a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=
at Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=
gh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =
religious holiday, I decided to "skip out" from this meeting to be here on =
Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=
her.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=
strated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=
eting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=
mitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =
that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=
=20

Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=
 budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=
he appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=
 of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=
ne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =
is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=
d and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=
ed split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=
ision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=
e chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=
ogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=
 block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=
t 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=
hat works for both of us. =20

We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =
until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=
 components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=
ts and projects in effect will serve as our "scope of engagement" discussio=
n.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=
een reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=
iscussion on that.    --Sally=20

I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in sepa=
ration.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.=
   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operati=
ons?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just=
 have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.

Thanks

Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling d=
iscussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most =
sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 p=
lan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious =
holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminsk=
i to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms=
 of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics an=
d attendees as follows:=20

ENE: Detailed 1Q Earnings Analysis Following Conf. Call; Reiterate 1H Rating

*	ENE reported 1Q:01 EPS of $0.47 vs. $0.40 last year, above our and
consensus estimates of $0.43 and $0.45, respectively.
*	We raised our 2001 est. to $1.80 based on confidence in continued
strong growth in wholesale segment, as well as incremental contribution from
retail energy.  Company raised 2001 guidance by $0.05 to $1.75-$1.80.
*	Highlights: Merchant Energy-- Wholesale volumes up 65%, ahead of our
40%-50% expectation, driven by growing need for intermediation services and
continuing impact of EnronOnline. Segment IBIT up 76% with higher unit
margins reflecting volatility running at twice last year's level, by our
calculation.  Expect full year 2001 volatility to match 2000 level.
*	Bandwidth trading--"deals are getting done"  above expectations:
580 transactions 1Q01 vs. 232 in 4Q:00 and 320 for full year 2000.
*	Results include reserve for $580M in receivables owed from PCG in
Calif.

ATTACKS HIGHLIGHT ENRON'S VALUE

By Lisa Sanders

3:02 AM ET Oct 4, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, one
of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market
maintained by Enron.

The attacks highlighted the Houston company's strength as a manager of
risk during periods of heightened uncertainty. Through its trading
centers, the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility
in oil, natural gas, and electricity markets, as well as other
commodities.

Although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked
planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks, its trading
activity resumed the next day.

By coming back online so fast, "we made the decision to provide some
stability in the market," said Vance Meyer, an Enron spokesman. "The
customers really appreciated the fact that we were there, providing a
place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market."

In a financial sense, Enron (ENE) didn't suffer, Meyer said. But
employees at the Enron Building in downtown Houston were badly shaken.
Nick Humber, who worked for Enron's wind energy business, died aboard a
Los Angeles bound flight that crashed into the World Trade Center.

"We have offices in Washington and New York, and people who had friends
that died or were affected in some way," Meyer said "We also had traders
who were on the phone with people in the World Trade Center when the
planes hit."

The decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in the wake of the attacks "may have increased
volatility, a boon to the group," said Bob Christensen, analyst at
FAC/Equities. Companies that can defray volatility by helping customers
manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business, he said.

Managing risk is what Enron does best, market players say. And that
strength should help the company going forward as U.S. businesses try to
recover from the impact of September 11. Through its EnronOnline
platform, the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling
about $3 billion a day, Meyer said.

"The world at large has become more risk averse, and Enron, which is in
the business of risk mitigation, should benefit from that," said Glen
Hilton, senior analyst and portfolio manager for the Montgomery New
Power Fund, which has a stake in Enron. "With energy risk and prices
potentially going up, they'll be the first number on many CFOs' speed
dial."

Other companies do what Enron does, but it's the best positioned to
succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power
trading, measured in terms of volume. Duke Energy (DUK) is the
next-largest competitor, but it has one-third of Enron's volume.



High profile departure

_______________________________________________________________________

That's a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on
the skids since last year, though it grew 151 percent on the top line in
2000. Other problems notwithstanding, including its money-losing
broadband business and its failure to sell the Oregon utility Portland
General Electric, Enron's largest black eye came in mid-August when
Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive since February, resigned abruptly.


John Hammerschmidt, senior portfolio manager of the Turner New Energy
and Power Technology Fund, said he "freaked out" when Skilling left and
managers immediately divested the Turner large-cap portfolios of Enron
holdings. Despite its status as a growth player, Turner had re-entered
the stock in June after a long absence because of valuation. At the
time, Enron was trading in the mid to high $40s.

"This is a premier company and a premier industry," he said, adding
that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock.
One of the rumors was that Enron was about to take a big loss from being
long on power when power prices were collapsing, Hammerschmidt said.
That has not materialized.

Whatever the problems were, Hammerschmidt said, he felt them to be
manageable. When Skilling walked out, Hammerschmidt began to believe
some of the rumors might be true.

"In our experience, when somebody in power leaves for no reason,
there's uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous," he
said.



Management continuity

_______________________________________________________________________

Now he's looking to get back in. Enron, he said, works in both down and
up markets.

"Enron's earnings are more solid today than they've ever been...and
they're valuable because we're becoming a digital economy," he said. "We
need high-quality power, and local power plants have trouble providing
reliability. Enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in
times of stress on the system."

Of course there's still the issue about trusting management. After
Skilling left, Enron promoted Greg Whalley to president and chief
operating officer and Mark Frevert to vice chairman.

"You cannot expect (Whalley and Frevert) to articulate the Enron vision
the way Jeffrey did," Christensen said. "They may grow into it."

On the upside, Skilling predecessor Ken Lay, who Wall Street credits
with building Enron into a powerhouse, is back at the helm, and he has
promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in
place.

"We have a great deal of confidence in Mr. Ken Lay as he was the
original architect of ENE's (and for that matter the entire industry's)
tremendous transformation for the past decade," Merrill Lynch stated in
a research report the day after Skilling left Enron.

What's more: "Ken Lay has promised more transparency at Enron, more
insight into how the company makes money, which will help," Hilton said.
"Trying to forecast Enron's earnings is difficult."

Christensen said that a "lack of data and clarity in regard" to Enron's
wholesale operations has been an issue in the past. Enron has promised
to provide more information when it reports its third-quarter results on
October 16.

Ultimately, only time will assuage investors' concerns. But with the
prospects that Enron has, the stock is a deal right now, Hammerschmidt
said.

"I don't know what gets people back, but buy Enron at $25, and in a
year, you're making money," he said. "I can see the stock getting back
to $50 in a blink."

We set a new west single book record with 206 trades in STCA.  We also set a new desk record with 611 for the day.  We launched an 8 hour block day-ahead product yesterday.  We have about 20 trades.  Ancillary service products are in the work.  Still grinding through contract language and EOL.
 
Did you know that Chris Mallory is an analyst, manages our STCA book, made $14 million in Q3, and is our leading EOL transaction trader?  Pretty cool!

Louise --

I've asked Margaret Carson to take a stab.  We have a meeting with DOE and Michael Miller this morning but will try and have something late afternoon.  Do you want to get together to go through our materials?

Jim

Jim,

Would someone in your group be able to put something together for me on the issues below (only about 2-3 pages),  Mark is speaking on several panels at the Natural Gas CEO summit in a week and the questions below are probably be best answered by you as I worry that we need to be consistent.  Could you get me something and I will combine it will the others.

I really need something by end of play Tuesday.

Thanks

Louise

How will the supply/demand blance change in various regions of the country?
Will natural gas continue to capture virtually all the growth or will coal make gains?

Subject:	Leadership Committees

We are launching a number of committees to perform key functions across Enron.  Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company.  Broadening participation will result in increased access to information as decisions are made and will allow committee members to extend their working relationships and influence throughout the company.

The committee charters and memberships are set forth below.  Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance.  We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair.

VP PRC

The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.  Additionally, the VP PRC will review and propose changes to the PRC process, the performance evaluation criteria and the promotion criteria.

The VP PRC will be chaired by Dave Delainey and its membership is as follows:


Tim Belden	Ben Glisan	Danny McCarty	
Michael Brown	Joe Gold	Jeff McMahon	
Rick Buy	Mark Haedicke	Rob Milnthorp	
Wes Colwell	Jim Hughes	Matthew Scrimshaw	
David Cox	Louise Kitchen	Jeff Shankman	
Janet Dietrich	Michael Kopper	Richard Shapiro	
Dave Duran	John Lavorato	Marty Sunde	
Jim Fallon	Dan Leff		



Analyst/Associate PRC

The analyst/associate PRC will be divided into 3 groups.  Enron Europe will have the same committee evaluate analysts and associates.  This group will be chaired by John Sherriff and its membership is as follows:


Pierre Aury	Kevin Heffron	Andreas Radmacher	
Rob Bayley	Joe Hirl	Stuart Rexrode	
Paul Chivers	Chris Mahoney	Marcello Romano	
Markus Fiala	Christopher McKey	Bjarne Schieldrop	
David Gallagher	Roy Poyntz	Ron Slimp	
Bruce Garner	Paul Quilkey	Rob Stewart	

  


The associate PRC for the Americas will be chaired by Stan Horton and its membership is as follows:


Sally Beck 	Troy Henry	Kevin Presto 	
Jeremy Blachman	Sean Holmes 	Brad Richter 	
Don Black	Sean Long 	Stewart Seeligson	
Dan Castagnola 	Rodney Malcolm	Hunter Shively	
Joe Deffner	Scott Neal 	Jim Steffes 	
Kevin Garland	John Nowlan 	Andy Zipper 	
David Gorte	Ozzie Pagan 		



The analyst PRC for the Americas will be chaired by Steve Kean and its membership is as follows:


Federico Cerisoli 	Mark Jackson 	Everett Plante 	
Jennifer Fraser 	Ben Jacoby 	Paul Racicot 	
Derrick Davies	Steve Jernigan 	Angela Schwarz	
Scott Gahn 	Jay Lewis 	Ed Smida 	
Rod Hayslett	Cheryl Lipshutz 	Jon Thomsen 	
Rogers Herndon 	Michael Mann	Emilio Vicens 	
Brenda Herod 	Ed McMichael 	Frank Vickers 	
Kevin Howard 	Steve Meyers 		




Analyst/Associate Program

The most essential determinant of Enron's continued growth is our ability to attract and develop new talent.  The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area.  Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization.  We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program.  Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe.  The members of this committee are listed below.  Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program. Billy joined Enron in 1992, and has served in a variety of commercial capacities across the company and has been an active participant in the Associate /Analyst program.  Please join us in congratulating Billy on his new responsibilities.


Phillip Allen	Andy Fastow	Eric Shaw	
Robina Barker-Bennett	Kevin Garland	Hunter Shively	
Rick Causey	Ken Rice	Stu Staley	
Joe Deffner			



Culture

We are combining the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility committees into a single corporate culture committee chaired by Ken Lay.  Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney and Kelly Kimberly will serve as executive directors of this committee.  This committee will focus on leadership and work-life issues (making it easier to attract and retain the best talent), in addition to continuing the work of the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility task forces.  The members of this committee are as follows:


Greg Adams	Louise Kitchen	Mark Palmer	
Shelley Corman	Michael Kopper	Paula Rieker	
Janet Dietrich	Richard Lewis	Jeff Shankman	
Jeff Donahue	Sean Long	Mitch Taylor	
Gene Humphrey	Dan McCarty	Mike Terraso	
Robert Jones	Jean Mrha		


The Corporate Policy Committee will conduct the MD PRC and review the recommendations of the other committees, giving substantial deference to the decisions of those other committees.  We will be forming other committees to deal with other significant functions, tasks and issues facing the company.

Maroun Abboudy is working with Joe Defner on Fund Flow concepts but I am really
focusing more on trading deals we can do to bring in funds flow at a cost far lower
than the structured Global Finance deals we have done in the past.  Will keep
you posted.

John,

As promised please find attached the updated Capital Charge presentation for you to distribute to department heads.  I am still working on more examples to present.  I am considering the effect of the cost of capital curves in valuing option premia.  I will have to discuss with RAC.  I am setting up meetings with Risk management starting monday to see how we are going to implement the Charge in teh Book.  I will be trying to sit with yourself as well and discuss how you see the charge/benefit flowing through the different books.

We have also discussed the cost of capital concept with Joe Deffner from EGF-NA (they are working on a similar concept with Louise) and will be liaising weekly with them from Funds Flow pricing signals.

Hi Edie!

I have attached two files that I received from Andrew Parsons for Enron America's headcount on the contingency floor. Per Andrew, he discussed this project, (which will provide traders with an alternative workspace should the need arise), with Louise Kitchen.  This expense project is being carried on Net Works books and will be allocated out to the business units using project settlement rules in the Project System module of SAP. This project will cover the period September  through December, 2001 and should cost approximately  $ 750K in total .  I will need a cost center or account or project, etc. to charge Enron America's share ( .270 for power and .402 for gas) of the costs.

Thank you for your prompt attention!

We consistently have to work on the lack of response issue.  Some of that is dealt with through walking around and poking around.  We just have to be vigilant in ferreting out information.  Additionally, approval can be received via e-mail, phone or in-person from business unit head OR commercial group head.  Our goal will be to do everything possible to make sure an article appears rather than holding it for future release.

As for the EEOS/ENA or cross group issue, that is addressed in #4 below.  Please advise.

I am worried though that stories will miss the report purely through lack of response.    Are we also addressing the recent issue which was a cross group issue (EEOS would have approved this story even though ENA wouldn't).  I think you need some check where stories include two groups.

Louise --

My recommendation for an approval process for EnTouch is as follows:

1)	The deadline to provide information for that week's issue of EnTouch will be Wednesday at 12:00 pm.  All information submitted after that time will be held until the following week.
2)	A draft of EnTouch will be forwarded to each business unit head (or their designee) and commercial group head (or their designee), who has a Business Highlight or other information appearing in that particular issue.  E-mail, phone or in-person approval will be required from either a business unit head (or their designee) or commercial group head (or their designee) prior to distribution to Enron Messaging Administration on Thursday at 2:00 pm.
3)	If approval is not received prior to the deadline, the Business Highlight or other information will be pulled until approval is received.
4)	In the event a business unit or commercial group provides information that crosses business unit or commercial group lines, all affected business units and commercial groups will receive the draft and a representative of each involved party will be required to approve per instruction # 2.

I believe this process will alleviate the two problems that have occurred over the past few months.  Please advise.

Additionally, I have attached the list of contacts Kathie uses for gathering EnTouch information.  It includes the primary contacts and their secondary contacts.  Please feel free to comment on this list.

Thanks.

Eric

fyi to all,

ICE has started printing copyright disclaimers on the spreadsheets from which we draw the information used in the Daily ICE Comparison, so I wanted to forward a word of caution on releasing any of the information from the daily ICE competitor reports externally.

A.	Market Updates

U.S. Markets

?	US equity markets are closed today but may open Friday. NYSE/NASDAQ/AMEX officials will reconvene later today to decide on restart.
?	Chicago markets  (CBOT/CME) closed early at 1:00pm CDT, CBOT electronic a/c/e trading expected to resume tonight for grains, and resumption of all commodities under consideration.
?	NYMEX: still closed, electronic Access trading planned to open later tonight (start time still under consideration)
?	In equity news, frightened travelers are expected to avoid planes once carriers resume flying, prompting Standard & Poor's to consider cutting the long-term credit ratings of all U.S. airlines, British Airways and Air Canada. That would raise borrowing costs and worsen the industry's least profitable year in a decade. The losses at U.S. airlines, until this week predicted to reach $2.6 billion, may now rival the $4.8 billion loss of 1992. 
?	In Europe, the four biggest airlines -- British Airways, Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Air France SA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV -- will all now post a full-year loss due to their reliance on profits from the trans-Atlantic market. 
?	In Asia, services to and from the U.S. contribute 10 percent to 20 percent of revenue at Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines Ltd. Some $3.8 billion was wiped off the market value of airlines based in Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and other Asian capitals in two days.  The plunge in stocks reduced the value of Asia's eight biggest carriers by about 14 percent.

B.	Transportation/Infrastructure Updates

Air Travel
?	145 domestic airports have now been cleared to reopen, though Logan International Airport will remain closed indefinitely, despite the Federal Aviation Authority's decision to open U.S. airspace for commercial airplanes.
?	At least some regularly scheduled United Airlines flights are expected to begin at 7 p.m. EDT Thursday, and some scheduled flights on American Airlines and TWA after 4 p.m. EDT.  Delta Air Lines said "very limited operations" would start sometime after noon EDT Thursday. Continental has canceled all regularly scheduled flights for the day, but planned to offer special service in cities such as San Francisco and Cleveland.

Maritime Transportation

?	Open, including NY harbor, which is doing individual vessels inspections and escorts into the harbor

C.	Political Updates

?	Indications are beginning to point to a substantial military strike against Bin Laden assets in Afghanistan as well as the Taleban government.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's chief economic adviser:  "We've been working on getting the basic infrastructure of America up and running again, that's the main thing we've been doing."
World Bank officials want to cancel their annual meeting in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund, now slated for Sept. 28-29 in Washington, according to media reports.  The DC police have also asked that the meetings be cancelled, but World Bank officials must wait for Treasury Secretary O'Neill to make the decision. Bank officials fear the Bush administration will want the meeting to take place to underscore that Washington is back to business as usual.

John and Louise,

I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed the Beaver Creek offsite and to thank you for the invitation.   I think everyone was impressed with how well this trip was organized - it was first class all the way.  The recreational and social activities were fun, the meetings were informative, and the relationships that were formed and strengthened with other business unit leaders should prove invaluable.  

Thanks again!

Craig Breslau

India: Orbit-e to piggyback on energy trading

  A recent report, authored by Mr. Jim Walker of Forrester Research,
estimates that online notional energy trading reached $400 billion in
the year 2000 - a whopping 750 per cent increase in volume over 1999.
Despite the global turbulence in e-business, energy companies jumped on
the Net bandwagon - investing in dot- com trading sites, building
private e-commerce platforms and forming industry consortia. Fighting to
gain online momentum, energy sites have aggressively refined their
offerings - extending into new areas such as financial products (like
natural gas futures and options contracts), non-energy commodities (such
as bandwidth, weather derivatives and metals) and niche services (like
managing information and evaluating trading risk).

  The Forrester report predicts that online energy trading will exceed
$3.6 trillion by 2005. The search for trading liquidity will restructure
the industry along three markets: (1) A central exchange aggregating
high-volume transactions for a limited number of standard products; (2)
Merchant platforms for buying and selling energy to match assets to
customer loads; and (3) solution sites for serving wholesale customers.
  This boom in online energy trading has provided a golden opportunity
for Bangalore-based Orbit-e, a consultancy start-up promoted last year
by Mr. Rahul Chawla, former CEO of the Indian arm of Cambridge
Technology Partners. Orbit-e was initially set up to provide consultancy
and devising solutions for trading in financial securities. Mr. Chawla
believed that the experience of Orbit-e in working with dealers in
financial securities could be leveraged to working with energy
traders.To boost its standing in the energy trading area, Orbit-e has
taken on as a managing partner, Mr. J. Kevin McConville, who was
Managing Director of Enron North America between 1998 and 2000. Enron,
according to the Forrester report, redefined online energy trading in
2000, accounting for $336 million of the total $400 million value
traded. By the end of the year, Enron's marketmakers conducted 74 per
cent of their trades through EnronOnline, rather than closing deals over
the phone.

  Orbit-e, which has now around 90 persons on board, secured its first
round of venture funding from Warburg Pincus in October last year.
Pointing out that the financing came at a time when venture funds were
fighting shy of the IT industry, Mr. Chawla claimed that this was an
indication of the sound prospects for the company due to the niche areas
it had selected.

  At a time when toplines in this industry are contracting, Orbit-e
expects to cross a turnover of Rs. 20 crores in the current year, up
from Rs. 8 crores last year.

We are launching a number of committees to perform key functions across Enron.  Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company.  Broadening participation will result in increased access to information as decisions are made and will allow committee members to extend their working relationships and influence throughout the company.

The committee charters and memberships are set forth below.  Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance.  We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair.

VP PRC

The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.  Additionally, the VP PRC will review and propose changes to the PRC process, the performance evaluation criteria and the promotion criteria.

The VP PRC will be chaired by Dave Delainey and its membership is as follows:


Tim Belden	Ben Glisan	Danny McCarty	
Michael Brown	Joe Gold	Jeff McMahon	
Rick Buy	Mark Haedicke	Rob Milnthorp	
Wes Colwell	Jim Hughes	Matthew Scrimshaw	
David Cox	Louise Kitchen	Jeff Shankman	
Janet Dietrich	Michael Kopper	Richard Shapiro	
Dave Duran	John Lavorato	Marty Sunde	
Jim Fallon	Dan Leff		



Analyst/Associate PRC

The analyst/associate PRC will be divided into 3 groups.  Enron Europe will have the same committee evaluate analysts and associates.  This group will be chaired by John Sherriff and its membership is as follows:


Pierre Aury	Kevin Heffron	Andreas Radmacher	
Rob Bayley	Joe Hirl	Stuart Rexrode	
Paul Chivers	Chris Mahoney	Marcello Romano	
Markus Fiala	Christopher McKey	Bjarne Schieldrop

Jeremy Blachman	Sean Holmes 	Brad Richter 	
Don Black	Sean Long 	Stewart Seeligson	
Dan Castagnola 	Rodney Malcolm	Hunter Shively

Rogers Herndon 	Michael Mann	Emilio Vicens 	
Brenda Herod 	Ed McMichael 	Frank Vickers 	
Kevin Howard 	Steve Meyers 		




Analyst/Associate Program

The most essential determinant of Enron's continued growth is our ability to attract and develop new talent.  The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area.  Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization.  We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program.  Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe.  The members of this committee are listed below.  Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program. Billy joined Enron in 1992, and has served in a variety of commercial capacities across the company and has been an active participant in the Associate /Analyst program.  Please join us in congratulating Billy on his new responsibilities.


Phillip Allen	Andy Fastow	Eric Shaw	
Robina Barker-Bennett	Kevin Garland	Hunter Shively	
Rick Causey	Ken Rice	Stu Staley	
Joe Deffner			



Culture

We are combining the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility committees into a single corporate culture committee chaired by Ken Lay.  Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney and Kelly Kimberly will serve as executive directors of this committee.  This committee will focus on leadership and work-life issues (making it easier to attract and retain the best talent), in addition to continuing the work of the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility task forces.  The members of this committee are as follows:


Greg Adams	Louise Kitchen	Mark Palmer	
Shelley Corman	Michael Kopper	Paula Rieker	
Janet Dietrich	Richard Lewis	Jeff Shankman	
Jeff Donahue	Sean Long	Mitch Taylor	
Gene Humphrey	Dan McCarty	Mike Terraso	
Robert Jones	Jean Mrha		


The Corporate Policy Committee will conduct the MD PRC and review the recommendations of the other committees, giving substantial deference to the decisions of those other committees.  We will be forming other committees to deal with other significant functions, tasks and issues facing the company.

At the end of the Leadership Giving Campaign, EWS had reached $488,832 in pledges, which is 38.31% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000.  Enron's plan calls for Leadership Givers to represent 60% of the total pledge goal, so we are short 21.69% or $276,768.  Even more disappointing was the weak 7.85% participation rate by those employees in the Leadership level (i.e., over $90,000 in base pay).  While part of this shortfall was caused by the decision not to conduct a Leadership campaign for EBS, most of the other business units/functional groups in EWS did not fare too well either.  

Below are the pledge totals and participation rates by functional group:

	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation
	EA			$79,485		10.78%
	EBS			$14,555		1.31%
	EEOS			$32,143		18.18%
	EEL			$6,104		14.29%
	EGM			$74,030		11.53%
	EIM			$62,567		21.62%
	ENW			$77,960		3.82%
	EWS Bus. Analysis	$25,024		12.84%
	EWS Bus. Dev.		$13,438		75.00%
	EWS HR		$6,985		8.33%
	EWS Legal		$38,800		20.65%
	EWS Research		$19,080		23.40%
	EWS Treasury		$13,661		71.43%
	EWS TOTAL		$488,832	7.85%

>From a corporate perspective, EWS is tracking fairly closely to the others.  Here are the other groups' totals:

	ETS			$146,466	12.92%
	Corporate		$359,925	10.07%
	EES			$131,439	6.56%

Ken, Jeff and Louise,

Below please find links for the Multimedia version of the Harvard cases completed in final form last month.  The text of the multimedia case is the same as that previously forwarded.  I have reviewed these multimedia cases and they are very cool!

I will be forwarding Releases to each of you for signature.  Please return the releases as soon as possible as Meg Wozny at Harvard, with whom I've been working on these for the past few months, is leaving HBS at the end of June--I'd like for her to have the satisfaction of finalizing this project before she leaves.

Harvard reports that these cases are best sellers!  Also, we enjoyed an "Enron day"at Harvard April 26th; it received such rave reviews that Harvard has requested a similar event for this summer.

Thanks to all of you for your participation and help!

--Christie.

Cathy -- Thanks for talking to me about your article.  I understand that you will be interviewing Louise Kitchen tomorrow morning and I wanted to give you some background information.  EnronOnline is Enron's global e-commerce web site for commodity transactions.  It has been extremely successful in reaching customers globally from right here in Houston.  If your article is about how brick-and-mortar companies in Houston are doing business virtually, EnronOnline can serve as a good example.  

I have included the detailed information about EnronOnline below.  You may also wish to visit http://www.enrononline.com/docs/marketing/PressRoom/ and http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/inthenews/ to gather more information. If I can provide any other assistance, please call me at 713 953 9354.

Thanks

Kal Shah

Background:  EnronOnline

	EnronOnline has taken the energy industry by storm, irrevocably changing the way energy commodities are bought and sold.  A global, easy-to-transact Internet-based system, EnronOnline has made commodity prices more transparent and available to all players simultaneously.  It has added market liquidity, lowered price spreads and given commodity traders more control than they've ever had before.

The numbers alone are staggering.  As of September 15, 2001, EnronOnline has completed 1.5 million transactions worth $800 billion in value, trading more than $5 billion on average daily.  It now accounts for 60 percent of all of Enron's trading volume.

More than 1,800 products are traded on EnronOnline in 13 currencies.  Products include natural gas, electricity, crude oil, coal, weather derivatives, air-emissions credits, plastics, pulp & paper, metals, steel and telecommunications bandwidth, and Enron traders update their prices second by second.  EnronOnline is truly global.  Through the web, it serves customers and markets in the U.S., Canada, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, U.K, Japan and Australia.  EnronOnline is a principal-based system, which means that Enron serves as counterparty in all transactions and guarantees liquidity to fulfill all buy and sell orders.

The true impact of EnronOnline resonates throughout the global energy business.  Typical large-scale energy investments, such as uncovering new resources or building significant assets, influence prices over the short-term or affect only a handful of players.  EnronOnline, however, is transforming the way energy commodities are bought and sold.  For the first time, Enron's buy and sell prices are posted publicly for all to see anywhere in the world.  Users can get a thorough read of the market by browsing through endless strips and terms, or they can strike immediately (with a few clicks of the mouse) when they spot what they want.  Accessed over the Internet with a secure password, EnronOnline is a global system that requires no special hardware or software.

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct. 5 /PRNewswire/ -- AEP Energy Services Inc., a subsidiary of American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), has announced plans to establish a natural gas and power marketing office in Portland, Ore. 

Eric J. van der Walde, executive vice president of AEP Energy Services, announced that Gregory E. Wolfe has been hired as vice president marketing - west and will manage the new office. 

"We're locating in Portland because of its close proximity to the western energy markets," said van der Walde. "The new office will increase our presence in the western markets and enhance our ability to establish relationships with energy users in this important region." 

AEP currently conducts trading and marketing activities from offices in Columbus, Houston and London. Van der Walde noted that western trading activities would still be handled out of the company's Columbus location. 

Wolfe joins AEP from Enron Corp., where he served as vice president for marketing in Enron North America's Portland office. Wolfe joined Enron in 1993. He holds a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering from the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colo., and an MBA from the University of Texas at Austin. 

Initially, the Portland staff will include six to eight power marketers and gas marketers. "We're beginning conservatively and will adjust our staffing as needed," said Wolfe. The new office is located at the KOIN Center, Suite 1550, 222 SW Columbia St., Portland, Ore., 97201.

Louise, 
I sent these out last night per John's instructions.  I have been receiving updates all morning.  Churns need to be completed this week for the project team to remain on schedule.  These are the most up to date; if I have received an update I have indicated it with "-c" by the group name.

If you are on this distribution you have been identified by John and Louise as the responsible party for signing off on the ECS 6th floor.  Your assistants and other key people  have done a great job of managing the floor plans so far and we're on the home stretch.  John made some group location changes today and a final review/update is required before churns are submitted this week.

Please take a moment to review the locations of your people and place them in the appropriate seats within your group (best printed on 11 x 17 paper)   Note that desks 858-860, 651-652, 658-660, 662-667 and 705-715 will not be available on Day 1, temporary replacement seats are assigned in the lower right hand of the spread sheet, if the lag time will be over two weeks.  

Kindly return this at your earliest convenience on Thursday, confirming your approval of the names and seat assignments.  I am also including the most current version of the 5th floor for your information.

Call me if you have any questions and thank you.

Louise, you had asked us to alert you immediately of any counterparty that makes noises consistent with an alteration of their trading policy with us.  

I've just spoken with Wisconsin Gas (the state's largest gas LDC), and they told me that the February basis transaction (20 contracts--Enron the buyer) we had come to basic agreement upon last week had been put on hold.  As the customer put it, "We had a risk management meeting at the end of the week, and we've decided to put that transaction on hold.  We'll let you know when we're able to move forward on that".  

We had reached agreement on Wednesday, but at that time my counterpart said that he would be out of the office for a couple of days and would wait until Monday to close the deal.  After not hearing from him during the morning, I called to close the transaction and was told that they could not go through with it.  

WIGas has continued to trade <30 day physical gas with us on EOL--seven trades so far today.  

Please let me know if there is any additional information you need or if there are any further actions you'd like me to take.  Thanks.

I've confirmed that the 1/2 block on the east side of the Kids' Center will be vacated by Clark Construction in January. That will give us time to see what kind of a problem we may have and to develop sketches and pricing on alternate drop off arrangements.

I met Savita Puthagai a couple of days ago and (without me saying a word to her on the issue) she told me that she is not moving her child to the kid's center due to the problematic parking.  

So its not just me!

Don
I am aware of multiple emails circulating within Enron regarding this project.  We have previously met with Alan Blood et.al. in Sydney regarding this project and expressed our level of interest by letter (attached).  Should you feel that there has been significant progress since our last meeting, then we welcome an updated presentation.

 opportunities in each one of our businesses.  Also an overall sense of bus=
iness strategy and focus would be helpfull.  From an HR standpoint I am not=
 sure all understand the PRC  as a development tool, as well as an evaluati=
on mechanism.   We need to find ways to incentivate new and creative busine=
ss development that may not result in short term results.  A discussion of =
the HR development is key.
>From a location standpoint there is a very nice  guest ranch with great con=
ference facilities that Enron has used in the past located in Jackson, WY. =
They can accomodate all our team and also have plenty of outside activities=
 that include horseback riding in the mountains which is much less stressfu=

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility=
.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in la=
te June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's ti=
me to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.=20

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. cl=
imb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.=20

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.=
  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to yo=
ur schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland=
, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.   =20

Regards

John

Dear John, 

 My colleagues and I are working with Australian Power  and Energy Limited (APEL) that is developing a $3 billion synfuel and power  plant project in the Latrobe Valley of Australia in Victoria using brown  coal.

 The power plant project will be 1,000 MW.  Part of the synfuel production will be  clean-burning diesel fuel of about 35,000 barrels a day (worth about  $400,000,000 a year at today's prices).

 APEL was wondering whether Enron could have an interest  in marketing the power and/or the diesel fuel.  APEL also would be open to suggestions  should Enron wish to be involved in other ways.

 The principals APEL are in Houston this week and could  meet with Enron this Thursday afternoon, 19 July.  

 John, would or your colleagues like to meet with APEL  this Thursday, and if so, what time and where would be convenient?

 Thanks and Best Regards,

 Don Reid

Charted ENE equity price vs. GE over 5 years.  Clearly, the gap closed after the market was able to 'get' EnronOnline.  Looks like the two are converging again, so you'd better start thinking of something fast...

John,

Louise would be great on this panel.  (Jon Corzine is a NJ senator, which in our country is pretty high in government.)  Also, I think the PG&E speaker is scheduled to be their CEO  (tentative).  It is a pretty high profile panel and important to Wharton we participate.  I need to know pretty quickly.

I told Jean that she could pay Bilbury 50K and nonthing else.  I told her that I completely disagree with any payment so view it as a payment to her or for her to be happy.  This upset her.  She wanted to give him 25k later and I vetoed that.  Is that how you spell vetoed.

'For the Record' questions for the ENSIDE Newsletter.  I will send you several issues so that you can see final form.


I usually break it into four segments to keep it simple. If someone wants to elaborate on a point or digress, that is OK.

I.  	Background/Education

II.	Industry Experience

III.	Goals/Priorities for the Future

IV.	Personal Business Philosophy

Let me know what else you need!

May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business Wednesday.  We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday.

John

To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company

Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals,  Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),  Coal,  LNG & Weather.   Though Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure.  Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses.   Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market.  

Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, and Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year.

The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.

Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London.

By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a part of Enron Europe.

EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand  by year end.

The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months.

In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London. 

Nick O'Day who heads both the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Genle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shappiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but he will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial Markets.

We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come. Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.

Louise,

Per our discussion, you will find attached an itemized accounting (from expense reports) for the customer ski trip that Andrew Miles and John Kiani from my group attended (3/27/01-4/1/01) in Vail with two customers of Iroquois Pipeline who we have been working with to try and do a deal on their Eastchester Phase II Expansion.  As for the link on the www.skihomerental.com website, I am at a loss.  I have put a phone call into these people for an explanation and have asked for this link to be removed.  I can only assume that this was set up when we were talking to the internal client entertainment group about using the "Enron" Beaver Creek houses as the house descriptions look familiar.  We declined to use their services as a trip of this magnitude would have cost closer to at least $12,000 (for four people) and we decided to scope one out independently.  Please let me know if this answers your questions and if I can be of further assistance.

 

Thanks,
Chris Hilgert

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

Louise-

Here is the start to the profile for John.  There is no real background info on him. Did he grow up in Canada?  What are his personal interests and family situation?  


JOHN LAVORATO
"For the Record"


In just over 8 fast-paced years, John Lavorato has evolved from an MBA student at Northwestern University to president and CEO of Enron Americas.  Joining Enron in 1993 as an associate, he moved up the ranks quickly. He moved to Calgary and performed many functions for Enron Canada that included leading the trading operation from January 1995 and the origination business from January 1998.  After successfully growing the Canadian trading and origination business into a major contributor to Enron Corp., he was named president and CEO of Enron Canada Corp in 1999.

Please find attached the org chart for Enron Americas.  The only org chart I do not have is the one for Don Black.  Jason Rios will bring a hard copy to you tomorrow.

 

I will check in next week to make sure everything is going well.

The e-mail that was sent out many weeks ago about the off-site indicated that it would run from Wednesday night to Saturday AM.  It is now running Thursday until Sunday.  Calger has found a leased plane that costs roughly $13k for one roundtrip and a total of $20k for two round trips.  I had already made arraingements to attend a wedding in Oregon on Saturday night.  It is a good friend of mine and my wife's.  It's in eastern Oregon and is about a four hour drive away.  I see the following choices before me:

1.	Don't go to Colorado.  Tell you guys that I'm a family man and not a company man.
2.	Go to Colorado and fly home commercial on Friday night, leaving at about 4 PM.  Incremental cost of flight would be $500.
3.	Go to Colorado and fly home on the rented plane on early Saturday afternoon.  Incremental cost of flight would be $7,000.
4.	Don't go to wedding.  Tell my wife that I'm a company man and that it is critical that I ride mountain bikes with a bunch of 30-something Enron folks all weekend.

While I have authority to place millions of dollars of the company's money at risk, I don't feel comfortable signing up for a $7,000 extra flight without talking to you guys.  #3, the jet set answer costs quite a bit more, but it dramatically increases the amount of time that I spend in Colorado.  #2 is cost-effective but gives me less than 24 hours in Colorado.  #4, while perhaps appealing to you, doesn't work for me.  #2 is probably preferable to #1, just requires a lot of travel time to me.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

I received your message canceling Redmond and adding Clifford.
I also confirmed that Derek Davies is definitely not attending.
If we move Presto into the 3 bedroom condo with Davis and Dayao - it would open up a 2 bedroom.  Hopefully we can obtain another 2 bedroom and then cancel the 5 bedroom.
Your thoughts please.
Thanks.
