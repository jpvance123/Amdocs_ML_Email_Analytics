Rob:

I appreciate your getting up to speed quickly with Lisa, Stacey & Mary in my group on the comments they are working to draft and submit on Ontario's emissions trading proposal.  Sorry to hit you with something else on the environmental front, but ENA has asked us for some potential assistance in monitoring/advocacy of future environmental regulations that could affect the Alberta PPAs -- either the deal in its current form or future efforts to sell the PPA.  My group and a number of others in the Enron environment, health and safety (EHS) department have worked on the Alberta PPA deal in the past, due to the fact that costs related to environmental regulation can be passed through to Enron.  Mike Macphee of ENA contacted us about how Enron could best look after potential environmental impacts on an ongoing basis, and I promised to first talk with Canada Govt. Affairs before proceeding, so we could work out how best to handle the issues.

Issue Summary:

Without boring you with details, ENA has discussed with utility TransAlta as well as other PPA buyers the potential for increased environmental regulation that could require additional capital costs for generators that would be passed down to PPA buyers. This includes possible Canada-wide regulation of mercury, additional cuts in NOx and SO2, longer-term actions on CO2 to combat climate change, and even a "multiple emissions reduction strategy" that could include some or all of these. Marc Phillips and Gus Eghneim of Enron EHS have worked with ENA to provide technical analysis of potential impacts of different regulatory scenarios.  Where our group comes in is determining the best advocacy strategy to shape those scenarios and helping ENA form the best business strategy from there.

TransAlta participates in the "Clean Air Strategic Alliance" (CASA) group, which will likely develop a regulatory proposal that can be negotiated and agreed upon with the government.  ENA is worried that TransAlta may not best represent the PPA buyers interests in this process.

Action Items:

1)  ENA wants to know what kind of position they should take to best protect its interests.  Our group can definitely take the lead on developing a sound position & strategy, based on what we've done in the U.S. and elsewhere, and what we've proposed in Ontario.  We'll start to formulate some basic ideas now, and can provide greater detail at critical points in the CASA or government policy development process.

2)  ENA wants to know who will perform monitoring and advocacy on this issue.  This is where you and I need to discuss resources, etc.  ENA does not feel it cannot commit any staff resources to monitor.  My group has substantive abilities on environmental issues, but logistically, its tough for me to send someone to Canada consistently to cover meetings.  In my previous discussions with Aleck, he indicated that he did not have the time/resources to learn and cover environmental issues.  Particularly on Ontario emissions trading, it seems that a "team" approach has worked well, and it may here as well.  Aleck and I had also discussed hiring outside consultants for monitoring some issues, but that may now be limited in these trying financial times.  

Let's try to have a call to discuss this issue, particularly #2, sometime this week if possible.  Please suggest times that would work for you.  Tuesday 10/2 is bad for me, as is Thursday morning 10/4.

Hope you're doing well & look forward to talking with you.  Thanks --

Jeff

Jeff:
 I have seen your note to Kate with final proposed letter attached. Thanks 
for taking on board some of our suggestions. Let me note however:
 1. A typo which we missed before in the last line of second para. - "taken" 
should read "undertaken" (you can't "take" an activity!)
 2. Disappointment from my point of view that vagueness has crept back into 
the third paragraph. (If I am to be designated a spokesman for Enron in 
Europe on this issue, even on a restricted, strictly reactive basis, I will 
need to know what some of the words and phrases are meant to indicate. The 
question of whether or not we support the creation of binding international 
commitments entered into by governments has, for instance, been avoided.) The 
Q and A will need imaginative crafting to address the lack of clarity in the 
letter itself.
 Your note implies the original English language text approved is necessarily 
the text to be used for all replies, with only local "cover letters". Such an 
approach will give local offices of Greenpeace in Europe an impression of a 
very US-centric approach. Have you considered the alternative of a local 
translation of the full letter, signed by an Enron Europe executive? (I do 
not necessarily advocate this approach, but welcome comment also from those 
copied.)

PLEASE LET US KNOW YOUR AVAILABILITY!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy 
Meeting" in mid-May to discuss global emissions issues -- such as climate 
change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the 
potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Our target dates are May 16, 17 or 18 in Houston (likely time is 10 a.m. - 2 
p.m.).  Please respond immediately with your best available dates so we can 
finalize our arrangements.

Please review the attached invitation and preliminary agenda.  If you have 
any questions or suggestions in advance of the meeting, do not hesitate to 
contact me of Jeff Keeler.

We look forward to your participation.

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, issued a ruling today on the EPA Section 126 Rule.  (As brief background, the 126 Rule would have required compliance with more stringent summer-season NOx caps starting in May 2003 in several northeast and Midwest states)

The Order states:  

"It is Ordered that EPA's Section 126 Rule is remanded as to all cogenerators, but vacated only as to those cogenerators classified as electric generating units ("EGUs") under the rule that supply equal to or less than one third of their potential capacity or equal to or less than 25 MW to the grid for sale per year."   Translation:  This part of the order appears to "vacate" or completely throw out the 126 rule for small cogen units (under 25 MW) or cogen units selling less than 1/3 into the grid.   For all other cogenerators, the court remands the rule to EPA for re-working, consistent with some of the court's earlier objections about EPA's handling of cogens.   Impact:  EPA will need to go back and formulate rules for cogens altogether, so there is currently no NOx compliance schedule in place for cogen units.   EPA will need to start from scratch for smaller cogens.

"It is Further ordered that as of May 15, 2001, the date of this court's decision, the three-year compliance period for emissions limitations applicable to EGUs under the Section 126 Rule is tolled, pending EPA's resolution of the remand of EGU growth factors ordered by this court."  Translation:  This more significant part of the order "tolls" -- or puts on hold -- compliance with the 126 Rule for ALL ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUs) until EPA resolves EGU growth factor issues that the court identified in its May 15, 2001 ruling.     

Impact:  The practical effect of this part of the order will be to delay implementation of the Section 126 Rule until May 2004, when the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation is scheduled to go into effect.   The EPA will not be able to re-issue its Section 126 rules in a time frame that would require compliance before May 2004.  The NOx SIP Call would have supplanted the Section 126 Rule in May 2004 anyway -- what this ruling does is take away some of the uncertainty that existed for the May to September 2003 period (original effective date of the Section 126).   This means that generators in states not covered already by existing NOx trading programs (OTR NOx program) will have another year to comply.

I will forward any more detailed legal analysis as I receive it, but this is the latest news.

Please call if you have any questions.

that developing nations were not included and the goals were not realistic.=

treaty. Instead, President Bush has adopted a "go-slow" approach toward=20
global warming and has vowed to spend more money to investigate the problem=
=20
and work with other nations to produce a better plan. =20

A new report from the National Academy of Sciences, requested by the Bush=

of human activity. Specifically, the report found that the Earth's=20

a "mistake" inconsistent with the president's broader goal of increasing=20
domestic energy production. Toward that end, the Bush administration has=20
focused on the construction of some 1,900 new power plants across the count=

groups have applauded the president's approach, echoing his belief that the=

This is obviously a political story packed with passion on both sides of th=

=20
the two polarized approaches that world leaders are taking toward the Kyoto=

United States, which may not be possible. The Protocol can only be enacted =

nations that produced 55 percent of the industrialized world's carbon dioxi=

it is leaning toward the Protocol but has not yet officially ratified it. I=
f=20
Japan does participate, proponents of the Protocol would have 57.5 percent =
of=20
1990 emissions (enough for ratification). =20

Nevertheless, here is how the two approaches shake out:=20

The Bush Approach We were given the best indication of the approach Preside=
nt=20
Bush plans to take in his own environmental proposal (expected some time th=
is=20
summer), in a recent radio address. "With new technology, sound regulation=
=20
and plain good sense, we can expand our energy production while protecting=
=20
the environment," the president said. The Bush administration's previously=
=20
released energy plan is primarily focused on building the nation's energy=
=20
supply through the expedited construction of new generation (including=20
nuclear power plants). Further, the president has said that "energy=20
production and environmental protection are not competing priorities" and c=
an=20
both be achieved with new technology. =20

While the president has not made any specific references to new provisions=
=20
for limiting CO2 emissions from existing or new plants, the new technology =
to=20
which he has referred most likely includes clean-coal technologies that can=
=20
be implemented to reduce emissions from coal-fired plants. As noted in the=
=20
3/27/01 IssueAlert, new, clean-coal technologies are being tested and=20
developed by various companies throughout the United States. One example is=
=20
the integrated gasification-combined cycle (IGCC) technology that first=20
converts coal into a combustible gas, cleans the gas of virtually all=20
pollutants, then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas. More tha=
n=20
99 percent of sulfur, nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in=
=20
the process. Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida,=20
Indiana and Nevada. As coal remains the United States' most abundant fuel=
=20
source, constituting 95 percent of our nation's fossil energy reserves, muc=
h=20
of the nation's plan for reducing emissions will focus on coal-fired=20
generation. It is important to note, however, that most of the clean-coal=
=20
technologies currently being developed eliminate SO2 pollutants and NOx, bu=
t=20
may do little to address CO2 emissions, which is the primary focus of the=
=20
Kyoto Protocol.=20

President Bush has also stated that his administration will fully fund high=
=20
priority areas for scientific research into climate change over the next fi=
ve=20
years, and help developing nations such as China and India to match the U.S=
.=20
commitment.=20

The Kyoto Protocol Approach European Commission President Romano Prodi has=
=20
said that the 15 European Union countries will proceed with ratifying the=
=20
Kyoto Protocol. As noted, the participation of another large industrialized=
=20
country such as Japan is needed to officially enact the Protocol. If the=20
Protocol is enacted, an international conference will be held in Bonn,=20
Germany, this July to spell out how the specific goals of the treaty will b=
e=20
reached. Toward this end, French President Jacques Chirac recently commente=
d=20
that, "Now is not the time to conduct new studies. These studies have alrea=
dy=20
been done. We have to set objectives." Specifically, European countries wil=
l=20
proceed with setting specific and targeted cuts in their emission gases suc=
h=20
as CO2 produced by power plants powered by fossil fuels. The EU has said=20
that, if ratified, it will comply with the Protocol's standards for emissio=
ns=20
reduction by 2012 and go "significantly further" to reduce emissions beyond=
=20
that date. Yet, interestingly, across the Continent, nuclear power, which=
=20
produces no CO2 emissions, has undergone a resurgence and presently generat=
es=20
an increasing percentage of the power in countries such as France and=20
Germany. =20

However, we have a good indication of the specific measures from negotiatio=
ns=20
that took place during the Clinton administration. Most of the emissions=20
targets of the participating countries will be reached through=20
emission-trading mechanisms. Trading emission of greenhouse gases allows=20
industrialized countries to buy emissions rights from each other at a price=
=20
commonly agreed. In other words, industrialized countries that do not meet=
=20
emissions targets can strike deals with other industrialized nations that d=
o=20
better than required. This may encourage reductions to be made where they a=

most needed. However, critics have suggested that the mechanisms amount to=
=20
loopholes that would allow large polluting countries to continue polluting,=
=20
while smaller countries trade credits that do not amount to significant=20
reductions.=20

Moreover, the two approaches being pursued by President Bush and the Europe=
an=20
Union represent inherently different philosophies regarding the urgency of=
=20
emissions control and methods that should be employed to reduce greenhouse=
=20
gases. There is little possibility that President Bush will change his stan=
d=20
and include the United States in the Kyoto Protocol. Without U.S.=20
participation, the Protocol may once again be stalled unless another large=

The Supreme Court cleared the way yesterday for the EPA to enforce its new 
"NOx SIP Call" regulations aimed at reducing NOx emissions in the eastern 
half of the U.S..?  The Court refused to hear an appeal by several electric 
utilities and Midwest states, which contended that the EPA had used improper 
criteria in setting the regulations.? The Supreme Court's decision lets stand 
a March 2000 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that 
upheld the regulations.? 

This means the NOx SIP Call regulations will go into effect with an 
implementation date of May 2004.  

Under the original SIP Call regulations, 22 states (AL, CT, DE, GA, IL, IN, 
KY, MD, MA, MI, MO, NJ, NY, NC, OH, PA, RI, SC, TN, VA, WV, WI) and the 
District of Columbia were required to submit State Implementation Plans 
(SIPs) to EPA by October 31, 2000 (with a grace period until December 31, 
2000).   Some states submitted SIPs by the deadline, but many are still in 
the process of developing SIPs.  Those states that do not submit SIPs or 
whose SIPs are not approved by EPA will be subject to a fallback Federal rule 
(FIP) and lose the ability to control NOx emissions from their sources.  A 
few states were excluded from the SIP requirement as a result of the 
litigation, but those states are in the process of developing SIPs anyway.

Now that the SIP call is final, we will be back to you shortly with further 
analysis of the SIP development efforts the states and other intelligence 
about what states and sources may be doing in anticipation of the regulations.

Please call if you have any questions.

EPA has announced that it will move forward in publishing a proposed rule to 
guide states in setting "best available retrofit technology" (BART) 
requirements to comply with new Regional Haze standards.  The proposal was 
approved on Jan. 12 by then-EPA Administrator Carol Browner, but current 
Administrator Whitman was reviewing that decision to see if EPA should change 
course.   It is now clear that EPA intends to move forward.   The compliance 
deadline will be around 2008, but companies will be making decisions in the 
shorter-term about installing technologies or other compliance strategies.

The BART requirements will primarily affect coal utilities as well as 
industrial boilers, refiners and steel plants built between 1962 and 1977.   
While the rule will apply nationwide to facilities affecting national park 
areas, the main target of the rule were sources in Western U.S. states 
affecting visibility in the Grand Canyon.

In addition to technology requirements, an emissions trading program could 
become part of the compliance regime for the Western states, but only if the 
BART requirements are not providing the targeted reductions.

The AP story below provides a good summary of the rule.  Or if you're really 
adventurous, you can access the original 148-page proposed rule at: 
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/fr_notices/bartrule.pdf

Please call if you have any questions regarding the regulations or the impact 
on Enron businesses or customers.

your area should be added, please let me know.

EPA Adopts Rule to Cut Haze in Parks
By JOHN HEILPRIN, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration will not challenge a proposal
approved in the last days of the Clinton presidency to clean up hazy skies
over national parks and wilderness areas, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Christie Whitman said Tuesday.

The proposed rule, requiring states to impose pollution controls on
hundreds of older power plants, was approved by President Clinton eight
days before he left office. It would require coal-fired utilities,
industrial boilers, refineries and iron and steel plants built between 1962
and 1977 to be retrofitted with new pollution-control technology by 2013.

However, some could meet the requirements by swapping pollution credits,
which companies can earn and trade by reducing their overall emissions.

``Part of the President's commitment to protecting national parks includes
protecting the views that draw us to these parks year after year,'' Whitman
said. ``We intend to clear that air. This rule will help ensure that people
will be able to see and appreciate these national treasures for many years
to come.''

That would cut sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter and
directly improve the air in 156 national parks and wilderness areas, the
EPA said. Haze is caused when light hits tiny particles, such as soot,
sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide emitted by power plants, refineries or
natural pollution sources, such as forest fires.

Whitman said the visibility in some national parks, like the Great Smoky
Mountains, is reduced by as much as 80 percent on the haziest days.

Environmentalists said Tuesday they worried the administration still might
try to delay or weaken the Clinton-era proposal before a final rule is
issued. The proposed rule already was studied by several federal agencies
under former President Clinton.

``The concern is that the White House or the Office of Management and
Budget or the utility industry would push for a weakening of the more
aggressive approach reflected in the Clinton proposal,'' said John Walke,
director of clean air programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Meanwhile, a group of utility companies has been fighting in federal court
for the past two years to block the EPA's regional haze program.

The proposed rule, amending part of EPA's 1999 regional haze rule, tells
states which of the older industrial facilities that emit more than 250
tons of view-impairing pollutants annually must install ``best available
retrofit technology.''

But it also gives states flexibility to consider economic factors, energy
impacts and the remaining useful life of the facility. The new requirements
also could be met through an emissions trading plan similar to one used in
EPA's acid rain program, giving states that take this option more time
beyond 2013 to comply.

States that affect the air quality of the Grand Canyon - Arizona,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming -
also would get different time frames to work with, the EPA said.

In Western states, the pollution cuts a 140-mile view down to 33 to 90
miles on average, the EPA said. In the East, 90-mile views often are
reduced to 14 to 24 miles on average.

Attached is a first draft of a response to Greenpeace's April 5 letter to 
Jeff Skilling asking for Enron's answers to some specific questions on the 
Kyoto Protocol and climate change.   Similar letters were delivered by 
Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK, 
Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium.

I have attached a copy of one of the letters below.  All the questions are 
the same in each.

I have drafted a response with the goals of:

1)  Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without 
"greenwashing."   We have an already-published public "statement" on climate 
change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts 
and accomplishments to back up our statements.   I think our letter can land 
in the stack that they consider "positive" responses, and not in the stack of 
non-responses or "we don't care" responses.

2)  Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about "Kyoto." 
  I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful 
answers to the general themes of the letter.   I have discussed this with 
many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down 
into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll 
quickly get into questions we can't now answer, and may never be able to 
answer.   I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look 
solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be 
engaged in this important issue.

3)  Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple 
applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script 
to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual 
meeting Q&A;  Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations; 
something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report.  

Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive 
issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we 
need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can 
understand and use.  With that said, I also believe that these messages 
should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying 
too far from the basics can be dangerous.  We should designate one or two 
clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by 
press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our 
response letter.

There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, 
using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds 
in the local areas.   I am not opposed to doing so, but would again 
appreciate being able to review these responses before they go.  Please let 
me know if you have other views.

I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 
if we can turn it around that fast.  Thank you for your input and assistance 
and I look forward to your reply.

Jeff

President Bush Reverses Position on CO2 Emissions

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News Item from The Washington Post, March 14] President Bush has decided n=
ot=20
to seek reductions in the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the nation's=20
power plants, reversing himself on a campaign pledge after encountering=20
strong resistance from the coal and oil industries and from Republican alli=
es=20
on Capitol Hill. In a letter to four Republican senators, Bush cited a rece=
nt=20
Energy Department study showing that restrictions on CO2 emissions would=20
result in a shift from coal to natural gas and lead to higher energy costs.=
=20
"I do not believe=01(that the government should impose on power plants mand=
atory=20
emissions for carbon dioxide," Bush said.=20

Analysis: The sudden change in President Bush's position on CO2 emissions=
=20
naturally has elicited strong reactions from both sides of the debate. The=
=20
extent to which CO2 contributes to the nation's pollution, and whether or n=
ot=20
the government should take an active role in restricting CO2 emissions, has=
=20
become an intensely politicized issue. Democrats and environmental groups=
=20
responded with outrage to what they perceive as a betrayal by the president=
,=20
while coal and oil industry officials believe that Bush's decision will=20
ensure a more balanced energy and environmental policy.=20

I won't attempt to debate the political aspects of the president's decision=
.=20
Rather, I will analyze Bush's current position impacts the energy industry,=
=20
and whether or not the lifting of CO2restrictions does indeed contribute to=
 a=20
sound energy policy. =20

It is true that during his campaign, the president made promises to limit C=
O2=20
emissions. In a speech in late September, Bush said, "With the help of=20
Congress, environmental groups and industry, we will require all power plan=
ts=20
to meet clean air standards in order to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide,=
=20
nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide within a reasonable period of=20
time." Yet, while many critics have claimed that Bush's refusal to place=20
limits on CO2 is a philosophical turnabout, White House spokesman Scott=20
McClellan said that carbon dioxide "should not have been included as a=20
pollutant" in Bush's campaign position because it is not classified as one =
in=20
the Clean Air Act. Further, the White House has said that Bush's original=
=20
promise was a "mistake" inconsistent with the president's broader goal of=
=20
increasing domestic energy production.=20

In fact, although many scientists believe that CO2 is a key contributor to=
=20
global warming, it has not been proven to have any direct effect on human=
=20
health. Consequently, CO2 has never been classified as a pollutant under th=
e=20
Clean Air Act because, in the eyes of those determining Clean Air=20
classifications, it has no detrimental human health or environmental impact=
,=20
except as it applies to concerns about global warming. In his decision to=
=20
abstain from placing any restrictions on CO2 emissions, Bush noted "the=20
incomplete state of scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to=
,=20
global climate change and the lack of commercially available technologies f=
or=20
removing and storing carbon dioxide." The president maintains that he is=20
committed to an energy policy that would seek to improve air quality=20
emissions of NOx, SO2 and mercury, which are already regulated as pollutant=
s,=20
but not CO2. Bush also said that he would work with Congress to reduce=20
emissions from power plants specifically, but that any such strategy would=
=20
include phased-in reductions and market-based incentives to help the indust=
ry=20
meet the targets. =20

Moreover, the president apparently cannot reconcile any possible restrictio=
ns=20
on CO2 emissions with ramifications that the restrictions might have on=20
domestic power supply. Clearly, any limits on CO2 emissions would have=20
tremendous impact on coal-burning power plants. By some estimates, coal, a=
=20
relatively cheap and plentiful fuel which accounts for more than 50 percent=
=20
of the electricity generated in the United States, produces about 40 percen=
t=20
of the nation's CO2 output (more than any other fuel). Yet, industry=20
officials have warned the president that any effort to restrict CO2 emissio=
ns=20
would compromise efforts to increase domestic energy production. Since Bush=
=20
took office as president in January, it has become increasingly clear that =
a=20
major component of the president's imminent energy plan will be efforts to=
=20
increase domestic power supply through a diverse fuel mix that includes coa=
l,=20
natural gas and nuclear. The president has maintained that he sees a=20
supplemental role for renewable energies such as wind and solar. However,=
=20
according to reports out earlier this week, Bush is proposing to cut the=20
DOE's renewable fuels and energy efficiency budget by 30 to 40 percent. In=
=20
any case, establishing this diverse fuel mix will take time, and the=20
president realizes that the country faces an immediate energy crisis=20
resulting from a growing supply / demand imbalance. =20

Aside from power supply concerns, the president also acknowledged the curre=
nt=20
high prices for natural gas, and how a reduction in coal-fired generation=
=20
would most likely keep prices at their high levels. In fact, the president=
=20
said that conclusions made in a recent DOE report led to his decision to ba=
ck=20
away from CO2 restrictions, more than any pressure he might have received=
=20
from oil and coal lobbying groups, as has been reported in many recent news=
=20
articles. Bush noted that the DOE study had concluded that regulating CO2=
=20
emissions would have led to "significantly higher electricity prices." The=
=20
translation of this is that, if restrictions were to be placed on=20
coal-burning plants, many power suppliers would turn to natural-gas=20
production as an alternative. Natural-gas supplies are already compromised =
in=20
this country due to increasing demand, which has driven prices up to=20
unprecedented levels. Bush's decision reflects the concern that, if power=
=20
suppliers begin turning from coal to natural gas in larger numbers, this wi=
ll=20
continue to exacerbate the supply shortage and keep prices alarmingly high.=
=20
"This is important new information that warrants a re-evaluation, especiall=
y=20
at a time of rising energy prices and a serious energy shortage," President=
=20
Bush said. =20

The DOE report also indicated that because coal-fired power plants are the=
=20
major power sector emitters of CO2, compliance with the emission caps would=
=20
be expected to have a major impact on coal consumption and production, both=
=20
nationally and regionally. If CO2caps were to be put into place, substantia=
l=20
reductions in coal consumption would result, according to the DOE, with=20
corresponding drops in the projections for coal production. Further, becaus=
e=20
coal has a carbon content more than 70 percent higher per Btu than that of=
=20
natural gas, the DOE report said that the carbon allowance fees related to=
=20
CO2 caps would make the continued operation of many existing coal plants=20
uneconomical.=20

In addition to the DOE report, Bush continues to be counseled by an energy=
=20
advisory team, including Vice President Cheney and Energy Secretary Spencer=
=20
Abraham, as well as having the ear of other members of the Republican Party=
.=20
Many Republican senators, including Jesse Helms (North Carolina) and Chuck=
=20
Hagel (Nebraska) expressed alarm over Bush's campaign promises to reduce CO=
2=20
emissions out of concern that the promises were a step closer to ratifying =
an=20
international treaty regarding pollution control. The Kyoto Protocol,=20
negotiated and signed by the Clinton administration but still not ratified,=
=20
would commit 38 industrialized countries to ongoing cuts in CO2 (along with=
=20
SO2 and NOx) emissions. Negotiations over the Protocol broke down last=20
November, but are expected to resume this July. If ratified, the Protocol=
=20
would limit CO2 emissions below 1990 levels. Currently, CO2 emissions in th=
e=20
United States are about 12 percent over 1990 levels. Reportedly, Sens. Helm=
s=20
and Hagel oppose ratification of the Kyoto Protocol because they believe it=
=20
could adversely impact the economy and allow American energy policy to be=
=20
directed by an international treaty. =20

It is important to note how the president's new stand on CO2 emissions=20
relates to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Just two weeks ago, t=
he=20
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the power to issue new standards=
=20
designed to reduce the levels of smog and soot in the air. However, the EPA=
=20
does not currently regulate CO2 emissions. EPA Administrator Christine=20
Whitman, in a series of public statements, had vehemently defended and=20
supported President Bush's previously espoused commitment to controlling CO=
2=20
emissions. =20

Meanwhile, the president's change in policy precedes several bi-partisan=20
bills that are expected to be introduced in the House and Senate this week.=
=20
The measures reportedly will provide incentives and set requirements to=20
modernize power plants and reduce emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx. Given the=
=20
president's new stance, however, the prospects for these bills gaining much=
=20
momentum may diminish.=20

In summary, President Bush apparently felt the need to give priority to=20
short-term resolutions to the nation's energy crisis over long-term=20
environmental concerns. Given the fact that coal presently generates more=
=20
than half of the nation's energy needs, the fossil fuel=01*despite its deba=
ted=20
environmental impacts=01*is a critical component of the U.S. energy supply.=
=20
Realizing that growing demand continues to compromise the country's power=
=20
supply, it appears that Bush made the unpopular decision to allow the heavy=
=20
reliance on coal to continue, at least for the near term. While some will=
=20
continue to say that the president reneged on his original campaign promise=
s=20
and was unduly influenced by oil and gas lobbyists, an argument can be made=
=20
that the nation's supply problems have worsened since last fall when the=20
president was campaigning. After examining the mix of current factors=01*
including consistently high natural-gas prices, demand that remains on the=
=20
rise and a continued reliance on coal, which remains comparatively=20
inexpensive=01*it is understandable that the president would take this posi=
tion.=20
However, the general consensus among scientists is that CO2 emissions=20
contribute to global warming, and that a long-term solution to curb CO2=20
emissions must be enacted.  As President Bush unveils his energy plan over=
=20
the next few weeks, it will be interesting to see how or if he addresses th=
e=20
issue of CO2 emissions from a long-term perspective. =20

Re: Voluntary Approaches to Climate Change - Action in Congress & the=20
Administration

Date:   April 30, 2001

In the current debate over how the U.S. should approach domestic and=20
international climate change issues, focus has increased lately on explorin=
g=20
=01&voluntary=018 approaches to reduce greenhouse gases.  President Bush=01=
,s=20
statements that the U.S. would not impose mandatory CO2 reductions on power=
=20
plants as part of a multipollutant bill and his position that the U.S. shou=
ld=20
not move forward with work on the Kyoto Protocol (which contains actual=20
commitments on emission reductions) have driven the discussion about=20
voluntary programs and whether such programs can achieve significant result=
s.

Two articles (attached) appeared in the Washington Post over the weekend. =
=20
The first, reported on an interview with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle=
=20
(D-S.D.) where he said that he and other Democrats would be open to new=20
approaches to address climate change, including voluntary compliance with=
=20
greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.  In response to strong criticism b=
y=20
environmentalists, a second article appeared on Sunday that backs away from=
=20
those remarks and re-states his support for =01&binding measures=018 to red=
uce=20
greenhouse gas emissions.  =20

Both the Bush Administration and leaders on Capitol Hill are seeking Enron=
=01,s=20
input on the structure and potential effectiveness of voluntary programs.  =
=20
As the Administration=01,s Climate Change Task Force is preparing its=20
recommendations for a new U.S. proposal, our input is needed in the next fe=
w=20
weeks.
Experience with Voluntary Approaches - Back to the Future?
The U.S. and other developed nations have acknowledged that significantly=
=20
reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be extremely difficult through=20
voluntary measures alone.  It is not yet known whether the Bush=20
Administration will propose a climate change plan that will result in lower=
=20
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.  However, it is unlikely th=
at=20
a U.S. proposal that calls for only voluntary measures will carry any=20
credibility in the international debate. =20
Clearly, industry opponents to carbon regulation do not seek a strong=20
program, but as recent weeks suggest, Administration officials have differi=
ng=20
views on objectives and approaches.    Below are some recent examples of wh=
y=20
voluntary plans in the past have not provided the desired results:
1) Under the Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by former=20
President Bush and subsequently ratified by the U.S. Senate, developed=20
countries voluntarily agreed to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 19=
90=20
levels by the year 2000.  By 1995, industrialized countries acknowledged th=
at=20
they were not on track to meet the voluntary goal, and initiated negotiatio=
ns=20
to adopt binding and quantifiable emissions reduction commitments.  These=
=20
negotiations resulted in the Kyoto Protocol=01,s targets and timetables, wh=
ere=20
industrialized nations committed to reduce their aggregate emissions to abo=
ut=20
5 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 and the U.S. agreed to a=
=20
reduction of 7 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.=20

2) On the domestic level, the 1992 Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo=
p=20
a voluntary reporting program to collect information on activities to reduc=
e=20
greenhouse gas emissions.  The aim of the =01&1605b=018 program is to encou=
rage=20
voluntary emissions reductions.  While some companies participate in the=20
program, it has not yielded significant emissions reductions.  Companies=20
participate mostly to receive positive pubic relations benefits and to gain=
=20
experience with inventories, reporting and verification.  Many hope to be=
=20
rewarded with credits for their voluntary action under a potential mandator=
y=20
program.  To encourage participation, 1605b provides wide flexibility on=20
setting a baseline.  It also allows for dual reporting of emissions=20
reductions, self-certification of reductions and permits the entity to deci=
de=20
the level of reporting it undertakes.

A 1998 GAO study said that EIA and other organizations agreed that many of=
=20
the reductions reported under the voluntary reporting program would not=20
qualify as =01&real, appropriately reviewed and verified=018 emissions redu=
ctions. =20
Congress has been considering how to strengthen the 1605b program for sever=
al=20
years and will likely include provisions to do so in new climate change pla=
ns.

3) Chafee/Lieberman =01&Credit for Early Action=018 legislation:  In the 10=
6th=20
Congress, the debate centered around proposals to help U.S. businesses=20
achieve =01&credit=018 for voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gases.  T=
he=20
legislation never progressed, however, due to the difficulty in structuring=
 a=20
voluntary program.  Concerns about granting credit against not-yet-created=
=20
regulatory regimes, difficulty with setting baselines for determining which=
=20
voluntary actions warrant credit, and political problems with links to=20
international commitments all added to the bill=01,s demise.=20

Opportunities for Enron

Through our ongoing advocacy on domestic multipollutant strategies and our=
=20
role as a respected source for information on how to structure market-based=
=20
systems for emissions reductions, Enron is well situated to provide=20
high-level input to the Administration and Congress toward developing=20
credible energy and climate change proposals.  In particular, we have a rea=
l=20
opportunity to promote ideas that benefit Enron businesses - new generation=
,=20
gas, energy efficiency, emissions trading and risk management - while handi=
ng=20
the White House some ways to restore its credibility on climate issues.

Enron=01,s input should continue to focus on mechanisms that will result in=
 real=20
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, while providing full flexibility fo=
r=20
companies and others to meet clear goals.  We have already indicated to the=
=20
Administration and others in initial discussions that voluntary measures=20
could fit into a comprehensive package, but will likely fall short of=20
environmental and international expectations. =20

The Senate will be conducting several hearings in the coming weeks, and the=
=20
White House=01,s Task Force will continue to meet and prepare its climate c=
hange=20
proposal.  Jeff and I will develop specific recommendations for the White=
=20
House and Congress and circulate them with you and relevant Enron commercia=
l=20

Jeff Keeler and I wanted to send you an advanced copy of an article that we co-wrote that will be published in the November 2001 quarterly Emissions Marketing Association newsletter.  The newsletter is distributed to several hundred leaders in the emissions market industry -- domestically and internationally.  The publication will also be distributed at the November 2001 climate change Ministerial meeting, which is attended by over a thousand delegates and observers, including government officials, businesses and media representatives.  The article supported multi-pollutant approaches as a means of addressing climate change and providing certainty to firms developing risk management strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  

Please let us know if you have any questions or comments.

FYI - Yesterday, I attended a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on climate 
change and climate science.  It gave some indications on what might be 
included in Bush's domestic plan to address climate change.
 
While little new ground was covered, consensus was evident on the following 
actions:

? focus on no-regrets and inexpensive reduction opportunities (energy 
efficiency, "low-hanging fruit")
? take steps to reduce emissions that have co-benefits (air quality - SOx, 
NOx emissions reductions)
? improve scientific modeling
? long-term research/development and deployment of new technologies, 
including renewables 
? think about adaptation strategies

This was a conservative response, but a sound foundation.  This is likely the 
message being relayed to the White House climate change task force and 
reflects the minimum options under consideration for Bush's domestic 
approach.  

These recommendations are consistent with Enron's positions and ideas we have 
already been feeding the Administration such as our multipollutant proposal 
-- which is market-based, encourages new generation, and has a circuit 
breaker to keep costs down.  We can also help the White House craft 
meaningful proposals on energy efficiency and incentives for new technologies.

I will keep you posted on new developments.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions.

I wanted to give you the heads-up that Enron's name will appear in a Wall 
Street Journal article tomorrow on multipollutant.   

As I have discussed with most of you before, we have been working in a 
coalition of companies (temporarily named the "Clean Power Group") including 
El Paso, Trigen, Calpine and NiSource to develop legislative proposals on 
multipollutant emission reductions from the power generation sector.   The 
group has hired Dutko Group lobbying firm to help float some of our initial 
ideas in the Administration and on Capitol Hill.  Mark Irion of Dutko spoke 
with John Fialka at WSJ today and discussed some of our concepts.

Background -- we have developed ideas that focus on making emissions 
reductions in NOx, SO2, mercury and CO2 in exchange for regulatory reforms to 
the New Source Review program.  We have structured these proposals in a way 
that holds multiple benefits for Enron -- promoting development of new 
generation, providing incentives to use new technologies and a diverse fuel 
mix, and environmental benefits with economic protections.  This is also an 
issue of competitiveness, as the big, regulated utilities with high-emitting 
grandfathered sources are trying to mold these issues in a way that would 
disadvantage new entrants.  We have had very positive discussions with many 
in the Administration and on the Hill, and are hoping some of our ideas are 
embraced in energy task force reports, legislation, etc.   

Note on CO2 -- the multipollutant debate has changed somewhat since Bush took 
CO2 caps "off the table" for the U.S. power sector.   We are not forwarding 
ideas that say "we must include CO2 caps", rather we are saying we can do 
multipollutant effectively and economically -- if policymakers want to 
include CO2, we can show them how to do it without causing economic collapse.

We plan to discuss this issue in more detail with many Corp and commercial 
groups at our Emissions Strategy Meeting, which now looks like it will be 
held on May 18 in Houston.  Please let me know if you have questions or need 
additional information.

Please feel free to forward to anyone else you believe should see this note.

Thanks,

Jeff

Mark/Kelly:

Attached is an article on Enron and our "Clean Power Group" coalition on 
multipollutant Clean Air Act legislation.   This is much more accurate than 
the WSJ article that ran last Friday, particularly on the point of CO2 caps.  
If you receive further follow-up calls or inquiries from reporters, please 
feel free to refer them to me.  If they really want a "coalition" source, you 
can give them Joel Bluestein's number at Energy & Environmental Analysis -- 
703-528-1900.

Electric Power Daily - May 8, 2001

Companies work to design plan for regulating air pollutants

A coalition of energy companies is devising a framework for
regulating air pollutants in a way that encourages new technologies
and protects the environment without requiring exorbitant
investments, but whether there is momentum for a regulatory
overhaul remains to be seen, according to one consultant to the
group.

Enron, El Paso Corp., Trigen, Calpine and NiSource are working on
a multipollutant strategy to replace the "piecemeal" regulatory
scheme at the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions from power plants,
said Joel Bluestein, president of Energy and Environmental
Analysis in Arlington, Va. The coalition's approach could include
carbon dioxide emissions if EPA moves to regulate that pollutant,
he said.

The coalition is meeting with lawmakers, the administration and
industry leaders in effort to garner support, said Bluestein.

"We can have secure diverse energy supply and a strong economy
if we structure the regulatory system properly," said Bluestein.
"What we are trying to do is present a framework to ensure a clean
environment with less regulation, to promote new technologies and
all fuels-including conservation and renewables, gas and coal-[and]
to provide the energy we need at reasonable prices."

The industry hoped to capitalize on momentum last year to move
the federal government toward a comprehensive yet flexible
emissions reduction program, but when President Bush reversed
his campaign position supporting restrictions on CO2 in a
multipollutant approach, that "changed the landscape a little bit,"
said Bluestein. Still, he said, the "same drivers are still there."

EPA has an acid rain program to address SO2 and a state
implementation plan program to curb NOx and in December it
announced plans to develop mercury emission restrictions for
power plants. The agency does not regulate CO2.

Attached are draft Q&A on Enron's response to the Greenpeace letter on 
climate change.   This document should be for close distribution to those of 
us in Enron Corp and Enron Europe who could potentially get questions on our 
response.  More general taking points for use by employees will be developed 
for distribution to a wider internal audience.

I would suggest that any detailed questions be referred to me so that we are 
able to closely control the messages consistent with our Corporate 
statement/strategy on climate.  If questions specific to Enron Europe come 
up, they should be referred to PR (Jackie/Kate) in London or Peter Styles in 
Brussels, who will coordinate closely with me.

Please review this document and make suggested changes and additions as soon 
as possible, as the letter has already been sent to Greenpeace (signed by 
Kelly and Mike on 4/30).

Thanks!

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Kenny's comments are absolutely false or, at best,  grossly misleading.  We 
need to respond to him.

The NUMBER ONE problem we have in California that is delaying our proposed 
power plant developments is securing ERCs.  My discussions with Calpine 
indicate that ERCs are their biggest problem as well.  (And in case someone 
hasn't noticed, the two most active developers in CAlifornia are Enron and 
Calpine.)  Air quality laws are definitely slowing us down, and slowing 
others down, which keeps the new, cleaner plants from being developed.  As I 
have mentioned before, this is actually making air quality worse in that the 
older, dirtier plants are running more.  Further, if you do the math, we will 
probably never make up for the dirty air that is created by keeping the dirty 
plants in business because of grandfathering, while the clean plants don't 
get done because of ever more rigorous BACT standards and lack of ERCs.    

Having said that, I do not agree that we should send a message that we want 
to relax or suspend the standards.  (However, getting 2ppm plants on line, 
which will put out of business the 100+ppm plants - as Calpine indicated to 
me happened in Texas - makes the point that maybe a relaxation or suspension 
is the environmentally appropriate thing to do.)  All in all, though, I 
believe that sucha common sense approach will go nowhere in California 
because the little people in the regulatory positions as well as the public 
will make sure that we pay for such a message.  Having said that, I will 
repeat the key things that we should be promoting, in my opinion:  1.)  stop 
the EPA from tightening the BACT standards to ever increasing levels of 
insanity.  (GE will not guarantee the present, and new, EPA requirement of 
2ppm, which EPA "determined" with no new operating data.  They just did it 
because they could.)  2.)  Stop making up rules for RACT adjustments.  (Kelly 
Brodbeck is working very hard, for example, to develop a program in the Bay 
Area to retrofit boats with clean burning engines to create ERCs.  A high 
level staff guy at BAAQMD "believes" that we should be RACT adjusted, 
probably making the program uneconomic.  There isn't even unanimity for this 
position on his staff.  However, this position if it sticks is irresponsible 
in light of the fact that the boats can just keep on doing what they are 
doing.  We are creating ERCs, which the BAAQMD will take a portion of in 
their haircut, and in using the ERCs, we will eventually put out of business 
the dirtier plants.  So, our program gets RACT adjusted and the air gets 
dirtier...)  3.)  Allow for payment of mitigation fees in lieu of buying 
ERCs.  There is precedent for that, but this has to be run through the SIP 
and the EPA.  Again, the in-lieu fees can be used for gov sponsored ERC 
developments (e.g., electric lawn mowers, electric water heaters, etc.), 
which will clean the air.  I am aware that Sandy is working with the CA 
legislature on this.  Go Sandy!

so what is the problem? CARB says there isn't one!   Think we need to 
schedule some educational meetings?

California regulators told congressional lawmakers on Thursday that clean air 
regulations are not to blame for the state's electricity shortages and said 
new legislation seeking to ease air quality rules was unneeded. 
Speaking at a House Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing, the 
head of the California Air Resources Board repeatedly said environmental 
regulations should not be suspended for the sake of electricity. 
"Air quality laws are not interfering with California's ability to bring new 
generation on line and run existing power plants at maximum capacity," said 
Michael Kenny, executive officer of the board. 
When asked by Democratic lawmakers on the panel about a provision in a 
pending electricity bill, the California regulator said the state did not ask 
for a relaxation of clean air rules and did not need the change. 
"We believe that air quality-related sections of the legislation are 
unnecessary," Kenny said. 
Rep. Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who chairs the energy subcommittee, 
said the measures allow flexibility to states for the temporary suspension of 
environmental laws. He said the key point of his bill is to ensure the lights 
stay on in California this summer. 
The Golden State expects to face threats of blackouts starting this month, 
when air conditioning use accelerates. 
Objections raised by Kenny to the Barton bill included disagreement on a 
section allowing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to waive, when 
asked by a state, the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act pertaining to 
nitrogen oxide emissions. 
Kenny said the state already gives flexibility on the issue and contended the 
legislation would go too far and be problematic. 
"The waiver applies to all new generation facilities in the state and does 
not allow for consideration on a case-by-case (generating plant by generating 
plant) basis, where unique local factors can be weighed," said Kenny.
