Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

In its first week, the ThinkBank's Idea Vault received more than 35 ideas 
from all over the world!  And those ideas aren't just sitting there -- oh, 
no.  Connections have been made, dialogues have been started, things are 
happening at the ThinkBank.   
What's your interest rate?  Come to the ThinkBank today.


Did you ask a question at the all-employee meeting last month that was not 
answered?  Take a look in eMeet.  We've posted responses to questions from 
the meeting, as well as another anonymous question to the Office of the 
Chairman.  See the "Office of the Chairman" category in eMeet.


Stop by the eSpeak Archives to see what was discussed in Cindy Olson's 
EnronOptions event.  Great questions, great answers.  They're all in the 
transcript on eSpeak.

																									Concamin to Propose NewRegulated Natural Gas Price  Scheme
																									
																									? ? 
																									? ?  Leading Mexican business association, Concamin, will propose that  Pemex 
adopt a new scheme for determining the price of natural gas.  The details of 
the proposal were finalized at a Tuesday night  meeting of Concamin's Energy 
Committee. Pemex currently uses the  price of gas in southern Texas as a 
price of reference in setting  the price of natural gas in Mexico. Under the 
scheme to be proposed  by Concamin, the price of natural gas would be 
determined with  reference to the costs of extraction, exploration, supply 
and  distribution, plus a reasonable profit margin for Pemex.

																					Public Offered Units of Williams 
																					Energy Partners
																					
																					
																					
																					?  ? Williams will offer the public a 32% stake in its Williams  Energy 
Partners petroleum storage and distribution partnership.  Williams Energy 
Partners filed with the SEC to register 3.75 million  common units, which 
will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol  'WEG'. Williams will own 68% of 
the Williams Energy partnership  after the sale. The partnership consists of 
four petroleum products  terminals along the Gulf Coast and the New York 
harbor, 24 inland  petroleum product terminals and an ammonia pipeline. 
Lehman Brothers  will underwrite the sale which is expected to begin next 
January.  The estimated total proceeds would be about $90 million if the  
underwriters exercise an option to sell an additional 562,500 units  if 
needed to meet investor demand. If that overallotment option is  
																					
																					
																					
																					
																																									
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																exercised, the public would have a 37% stake in the  partnership. The four 
marine terminals have a storage capacity of  more than 17.6 million barrels. 
The 1,100 mile-long pipeline  transports and distributes ammonia from 
production facilities in  Texas and Oklahoma to various distribution points. 
Ammonia is  produced from natural gas and is used primarily as a nitrogen  
fertilizer. Williams did not name an individual price for the common  units. 
It would expect to receive net proceeds of about $70 million  from the sale 
of the 3.75 million common units, based on a?  unit price of $20. WEG will 
use the proceeds, together with $90  million from its line of credit, to 
repay $156 million of debt owned  to Williams. Williams Energy will offer 
holders of the units a  quarterly distribution of $0.52 per unit each 
quarter. Last week,  Williams said third-quarter profit more than quadrupled, 
beating  estimates.

																																		DTE,  MCN Merger to Close Next Year 
																																		
																																		
																																		? ?  DTE Energy Holding says it is unlikely that the merger with MCN  Energy 
Group will close this year. The delay is due to the  companies' decision to 
sell a portion of MCN's natural gas  distribution capacity to a unit of 
Exelon, which is subject to  Michigan PSC review.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 th=
ey=20
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a=20
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associat=
ed=20
with an EOL trade.

Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large=20
crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 2001. Th=
is=20
trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second largest=
=20
transaction conducted to date on EOL.

STEEL
Steel Trading and Origination teams, headed by Greg Hermans and Tim=20
Battaglia, respectively, have already defined a Hot-Rolled coil financial=
=20
product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed wi=
th=20
customers.

Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the stee=
l=20
industry to hedge their price exposure for the first time in history. The=
=20
access to hedging products will help the steel industry manage technicaliti=
es=20
and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent=20
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved acces=
s=20
to capital.

The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial=20
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel=20
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS
FuelCell Energy, Inc. recently announced that it has entered into an allian=
ce=20
with ENA.  FuelCell Energy and Enron will work together to develop and mark=
et=20
FuelCell Energy's Direct FuelCellc (DFCc) products.  In connection with the=
=20
alliance, Enron has invested $5 million in the common stock of FuelCell=20
Energy.  Additionally, FuelCell Energy will issue warrants enabling Enron t=
o=20
purchase up to 1.3 million shares of FuelCell Energy common stock. =20

Fuel cell developer Dais-Analytic Corp. also announced an alliance with ENA=
. =20
As part of this alliance, Enron has made an equity investment in=20
Dais-Analytic and will support market development, distribution and other=
=20
field services for Dais-Analytic's fuel cell, humidity control and related=
=20
products. =20

=20
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of=
=20
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a=20
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which do=
es=20
not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct=20
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given =
or=20
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but you=
r=20
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects=

standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length=20
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. =

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=
al=20
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.

																														NYMEX to Launch Online Trading Next Spring
																														
																														
																														
																														?  The NYMEX plans to launch its online trading platform, enymex, in  the 
second quarter of next year. The system will trade and clear  forward 
contracts for physical commodities such as crude oil,  refined products, 
natural gas, electricity and metals. It will  compete with existing ventures 
such as IntercontinentalExchange and  HoustonStreet. Enymex was originally 
set to start in the third  quarter of this year. NYMEX had been in talks on 
joining ICE before  deciding to go it alone.

This is to request that Spinnaker increase their nomination effective as
soon as possible from the current 9,100 to 12,600.  A spreadsheet is
attached showing the figures and method used to determine the requested
rate.  I will continue to monitor the well(s) daily for rate changes and
will advise of required changes in noms.

Please advise when you have increased your nom and the effective date -
either by e-mail or telephone (direct line 337/272-7403).  Thank you for
your cooperation in this effort to maintain a balance between noms and
delivery.

EnergyGateway.com Allows Producers Variable Levels of  Service Online? 

? ?
? ?  EnergyGateway.com, an  e-community that offers customized energy 
transactions among  suppliers and consumers, has announced a new program that 
will allow  natural gas producers to transact online under variable or  
interruptible levels of service in addition to firm service  specifications. 
EnergyGateway.com lets the producer choose its level  of service when the 
offer is made, including swing, interruptible  and firm service. This lets 
buyers and sellers transact for any term  and is not simply a day-trading 
tool. Allowing more producers to  compete online can only add to the 
transaction savings achieved by  participants. To create an optimum portal 
for buyers and sellers, we  must have direct contact with the producer 
community in order to  meet the needs of our customers. This program can 
provide a service  to producers in any region of the

Announcing Initiatives to Increase Domestic Energy Production
The Director of the Minerals Management Service, Walt Rosenbusch, announced=
=20
today several initiatives to increase domestic natural gas and oil producti=
on=20
to meet the nation=01,s energy needs. These initiatives are proposed for th=
e=20
next offshore oil and gas lease sale in the Central Gulf of Mexico schedule=
d=20
for March 28, 2001. The announcement came as part of the issuance of a=20
proposed notice of sale for Sale 178 in today=01,s Federal Register.
MMS designed two of these initiatives specifically to spur domestic natural=
=20
gas production during the years 2004-2006. Director Rosenbusch called the=
=20
changes "strong initiatives on the part of the MMS to deal with the large=
=20
projected increase in gas demand for the nation. Several studies, including=
=20
the report issued by the National Petroleum Council, indicate that the=20
nation's demand for natural gas will grow from the current 22 trillion cubi=
c=20
feet (TCF) of gas to 29 TCF of gas in 2010. These initiatives may contribut=
e=20
additional gas production, in the range of 500 billion to 1 TCF per year in=
=20
the period 2004 to 2006."
Rosenbusch noted that "there are predictions of serious shortages of natura=
l=20
gas this winter, including the northeast U.S. There have already been sever=
al=20
brownouts across the country this year because of the demands on electrical=
=20
production."
Included in the proposed notice are two initiatives for increasing natural=
=20
gas production:
? An incentive to drill for deep gas deposits located in the shallow-water=
=20
shelf area of the Gulf of Mexico by providing for royalty suspension for th=
e=20
first 20 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of production from a well drilled below=
=20
15,000 feet sea level.=20
? An incentive to drill for natural gas below the thick subsalt domes. MMS=
=20
proposes that lessees obtain a 2-year extension of the 5-year primary lease=
=20
term when an operator has drilled a first subsalt well and needs additional=
=20
time to image the subsurface data to determine the appropriate next drillin=
g=20
target. This will avoid premature lease expiration and the consequent delay=
=20
in exploration.=20
In addition, MMS proposes modified initiatives for deep water royalty relie=
f:
? An incentive to keep exploring and developing oil and gas deposits in the=
=20
ultra deepwater areas to replace the expiring provisions of the 1995=20
Deepwater Royalty Relief Act. A royalty suspension volume of nine million=
=20
barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) is proposed for water depths from 800 meter=
s=20
to 1,599 meters, and a royalty suspension volume of the first 12 million BO=
E=20
in water depths equal to or greater than 1,600 meters.=20
? An opportunity to apply for additional "discretionary" royalty relief,=20
pursuant to new proposed rulemaking, if certain conditions are satisfied.=
=20
MMS will conduct public workshops to discuss the new provisions announced i=
n=20
the proposed notice of sale, as well as provisions of the proposed rule (65=
=20
FR 69259 published November 16), regarding discretionary royalty relief for=
=20
leases in water depths of 200 meters and greater. Details about the worksho=
ps=20
that will be held this December in New Orleans and Houston will be released=
=20
today.
Proposed Sale 178 encompasses about 4,366 available blocks in the Central=
=20
Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf planning area offshore Louisiana,=20
Mississippi, and Alabama. This area covers about 23.07 million acres. Block=
s=20
in this sale are located from three to 200 miles offshore in water depths=
=20
ranging from four to more than 3,425 meters. Estimates of undiscovered=20
economically recoverable hydrocarbons expected to be discovered and produce=
d=20
as a result of this sale proposal range from 150 to 440 million barrels of=
=20
oil and 1.53 to 4.39 TCF of natural gas.
MMS is the federal agency that manages the nation's natural gas, oil and=20
other mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. The agency also=20
collects, accounts for and disburses over $5 billion per year in revenues=
=20
from federal offshore mineral leases and from onshore mineral leases on=20

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We plan to upgrade the two NT servers that run Gas TDS's middle-tier 
applications this weekend.  Therefore, TDS will not be available between 
12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, December 10th, 2000.  If this downtime is 
in conflict with your schedule, please let me know ASAP.

I would also like to point out to you that when TDS is brought back on line, 
it will be necessary for all the desks to be reloaded.  Since we introduced 
the TDS Flag last month, this should not effect any of the desks.

Thank you for your cooperations,
Kenny H.

																	PG&E Reports Defective Steam Tubes 
																	
																	
																	
																	?  ? PG&E has reported to the NRC that 65 steam generator  tubes in its 
Diablo Canyon 1 nuclear unit in California were  defective but have been 
plugged and pose no safety threat. The  tubes, made from a special metal 
alloy, showed cracks from corrosion  and stress and were no longer in 
service. The tubes are part of the  No. 2 steam generator in Diablo Canyon 1. 
There are four steam  generators in each unit of the two-unit Diablo plant, 
and each  generator has 3,300 tubes. The tubes carry reactor coolant from 
the  reactor to the steam generators. If tubes are cracked, a small  amount 
of radioactive materials could leak into the unit's steam  cycle. The NRC 
limits the number of defective tubes to 15% of the  total in the steam 
generator, but a nuclear unit will begin to lose  power if the total reaches 
10%. Diablo 1 is in cold shutdown, but is  expected to link back up to the 
transmission grid in about a week,  when it will be at about 15% capacity. 
																	
																	
																	
																	
																	
																	
																																				
																												
																												
																												
																												
																												
																												
																												BP  Buys Alliance Pipeline Capacity
																												
																												
																												? ?  BP Amoco has been acquiring transportation capacity on the Alliance  
pipeline as a prelude to shipping Arctic natural gas through Canada  to the 
US market. BP's Canadian unit was not one of the original  natural gas 
producers to back Alliance, the 1,900-mile?  pipeline set to transport up to 
1.325 Bcf per day to Chicago from  northeastern British Columbia in two 
weeks. But, over the past few  months, it has assumed the transportation 
responsibilities of eight  shippers on the pipeline whose volumes total about 
250 MMcf per day,  and it plans to increase that amount. Construction of one 
or more  pipelines connecting those Arctic pools across Canada's far north 
to  either Alliance or TransCanada PipeLines Alberta system is expected  to 
take at least five years. BP says that gaining capacity on  Alliance will 
eventually play into its Arctic natural gas strategy,  but in the short term 
it is broadening its asset management service.

																															Tnpc  Applies to Sell Power in Texas
																															
																															
																															
																															?  ? Tnpc, formed by Enron, is seeking approval from the Texas PUC  to sell 
power in the state. Tnpc's New Power wants to start  marketing to homes and 
small businesses early next year. Texas  hasn't deregulated yet, but is 
planning a pilot program next year  and will open its entire market to 
competition in January 2002.  Enron formed New Power in May. It has 285,000 
natural gas customers  and 20,000 power customers, mostly in Georgia, Ohio, 
and  Pennsylvania.

																																	Consultant Says Mexico to Pay Billions for Natural Gas  
																																	
																																	
																																	? ?  Mexico, over the next decade, will likely need to spend $40.6  Billion 
to import natural gas, given Pemex's failure to conduct  adequate capital 
investment, consultants Consultores Internacionales  have said in a report. 
The estimate assumes an average price for  natural gas of $4.50 per MMBtu 
over the period. In a more  conservative scenario, with the average price of 
natural gas at  $3.50 per MMBtu, the country over the next 10 years would 
need to  spend $31.6 billion dollars on natural gas imports, according to 
the  report. Under both scenarios, estimates expect that Mexico will need  to 
import 24.7 Bcf of natural gas during the coming decade.

																																				September Canadian Natural Gas Sales
																																				
																																				
																																				Natural gas sales totaled 4.22 billion cubic meters in  September, up 10.2% 
over September 1999. The increase was the result  of increased demand by the 
industrial and residential sectors. Use  by the industrial sector rose 11.7%, 
amid higher use of natural gas  for electricity generation and stronger 
demand by the chemical  industry. Year-to-date sales were up 7.1% over the 
same period in  1999. Industrial sector sales continued to grow strongly, 
posting an  11.1% increase. Consumption by the residential sector increased 
1%,  while the commercial sector decreased 1.1%.

Mark Schrab -  

???????We received a call today from Petroquest demanding we increase our 
nominations to stay in balance. I have been forwarding you noms daily but PQ 
says you are not changing your nom with ANR.  

??????We (SEC and Cheyenne) are 9,600 mmbtu behind on a month to date basis. 
Please increase our nomination immediately and stay on top of it. As I sent 
you earlier today, current volumes are over 14,000 mmbtu/day which generates 
11,900 mmbtu/day for our share on a current basis. The addition of 9600 over 
20 days adds 480/day for a total nom of 12,380 mmbtu/day (SEC/Cheyenne) 
subject to daily change of production.

Tom:
I tried to leave you a message about what happened on the last cycle for gas 
day 9 but your voicemail at the office didn't work.; Grand Chenere compressor 
went down by 100,000MM in total late saturday night.  This affected 20,000 of 
supply coming from HIOS and 14,000 SE Transmission pool purchases.  I was 
able to make up 15,195 on the 10th. by increasing our HIOS nom and paying 
back PG&E.   ANR said the compressor is back up now however with shippers 
doing makeup this could cause more capacity cuts for the 12th.  I'll be back 
tomorrow, I've got jury duty today.  
W&T left me a messge at the office that they went down but they didn't page 
me so we were cut 2,982 at SS207 over the weekend;which also cut our SE Tran. 
markets.  I've taken them down to 1 unless you'd like to shut them in ( 
Deal498384).
Mark  

713-905-9622 pager

Kirk- Shawn at Duke said he cut us at N.Maumee(ML7) by 1000, see if our Mkt. 
wants makeup for 12th.

Subject: "Texas Chili"



I have it on good authority that this is a true story; A True Texas Story: 



???????????????These are notes from an inexperienced chili 
taster named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from New Jersey... 
"Recently I was lucky enough to be the 10,000th attendee at the State 
Fair in Texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili 
cook-off. ??Apparently the original Judge #3 called in sick at the 
last moment, and I happened to be standing there when the call came 
in. ?I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that it 
would be a fun event and a true taste of Texas hospitality. ?They 
assured me that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, 
they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I 
accepted. ?Here are the scorecards from the event." 

???*****Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili 
???????????????????????JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. 
Amusing kick. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very 
mild. 
???????????????FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You 
could remove dried paint from your driveway with it. Took me two 
beers to put the flames out. ?Hope that's the worst one. These Texans 
are crazy  
???*****Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight 
Jalapeno tang. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to 
be taken seriously. 
???????????????FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! 
I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave 
off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had 
to walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face. 

???*****Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. 
Needs more beans. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty,good use of 
red peppers. 
???????????????FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill.  
My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the 
routine by now. ?Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is 
in the front part of my chest. ?I'm getting shit-faced. 

??????*****Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice.  
Disappointing. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side 
dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili. 
???????????????FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, 
but was unable to taste it. ?Sally, the bar maid, was standing 
behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look 
HOT,just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating. 

?????*****Chili # 5: Linda's Lethal Lip Remover 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers 
freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more 
tomato. ?Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. 
???????????????FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus 
my eyes. ?I farted and four people behind me burst into flames. 
The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had 
given me brain damage. ?Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by 
pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. ?It really pisses me off 
that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. ?Screw those 
rednecks! 

?????????*****Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili.  
Good balance of spice and peppers. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: The best yet. ?Aggressive use of peppers, 
onions, and garlic. ?Superb. ? 
???????????????FRANK: My intestines are now a straight-pipe filled 
with gaseous, sulfuric flames. ?No one seems inclined to stand behind 
me except that slut Sally. ?I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone! 

?????????***Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on 
canned peppers. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally 
threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note 
that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of 
distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. 
???????????????FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the 
pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one 
eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt 
is covered with chili that slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants 
are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during 
the autopsy they'll know what killed me. ?I've decided to stop 
breathing. ?It's too painful. ?Screw it! ?I'm not getting any anyway. 
If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my 
stomach. 

???????????????*****Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending... this is a nice blend 
chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its 
existence. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced 
chili, neither mild nor hot. ?Sorry to see that most of it was lost 
when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top 
of himself. ?Not sure if he's going to make it. ?Poor Yank.

As you are probably aware, if the voting results in Florida stand as they  
are now, George W. Bush will be our next President. This will have  
Catastrophic results in our vital, no, indispensable entertainment Industry. 
? 
?Barbara Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon, Whoopie Goldberg, Alec  
Baldwin, Martin Sheen, among many others have sworn to leave the country if  
George W. Bush is elected President. 
? 
?And this is where YOU can help. We need volunteers to help pack and to load  
moving vans. We also need volunteers to provide airfare for these  
irreplaceable national treasures so they can relocate before they can change  
their minds. For the cost of a small SUV you can sponsor one of these  
celebrities and their unfortunate relocation. You will know that your 
efforts  
are helping when you receive postcards, letters and pictures from your 
chosen  
?"refugee" as they learn to become a useful citizen in the third world  
country of their choosing. 
? 
?You will help, won't you. It costs so little, but it means so much. 
? 
Call 1-800-deport-a-lib. Operators are standing by. Major Credit cards are  
Accepted.

delivery was up across the US and Canada yesterday as  the cash market 
followed the futures rally. Natural gas for next day  delivery at the Henry

																				NEB  Releases Energy Market? Assessment 
																				
																				? ?The National Energy Board has released its  latest in a series of Energy 
Market Assessment? reports  entitled Canadian Natural Gas Market Dynamics and 
Pricing. The  report identifies the factors that affect natural gas prices 
and  describes the current functioning of the regional gas markets in  
Canada. The Board's report concludes that Canada has become part of  an 
integrated North American natural gas market. Natural gas can be  bought from 
many supply sources and delivered to any market centre  through an extensive 
North American pipeline grid. With the  increased integration of the markets, 
regional supply and demand  forces are felt throughout the marketplace. It 
also says that a  combination of strong economic growth in North America, a 
preference  for natural gas fired electricity generation, and low natural 
gas  prices led to sustained growth in demand throughout the 1990s.  However, 
the growth in natural gas supply has lagged during the last  few 
																				
																				
																				
																				
																				
																																									
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	years. This is primarily attributable to the low oil price  environment of 
1997/1998 which reduced cash flow for the producing  sector. In turn, 
drilling activity decreased throughout North  America. Since demand growth 
has outpaced supply growth, natural gas  prices have increased significantly 
over the last year. With oil  prices recovering sharply in 1999/2000, the 
producing sector has  responded and drilling activity is at high levels. 
Despite the  drilling activity, there is a lag between developing additional 
gas  supplies and connecting those supplies to the market. In time, there  
will be a supply and demand response and accompanying relief in  natural gas 
prices is expected. A period of market adjustment is  necessary any time the 
dynamic between supply, transportation and  demand is significantly changed. 
It is difficult, if not impossible,  to predict with certainty any movements 
in the commodity markets.  The Report found that recent increases in the 
commodity

Bill,

The VR 375 A-1D gas well is currently producing 5.2 Mmcfd.  This well is
very sensitive to ANR system pressure so be prepared for daily fluctuations.
The VR 375 A-1 oil well should come online today (11/2/00).  We will
transmit updates as they become available.

Tom

Mark Schrab -  

???????We received a call today from Petroquest demanding we increase our 
nominations to stay in balance. I have been forwarding you noms daily but PQ 
says you are not changing your nom with ANR.  

??????We (SEC and Cheyenne) are 9,600 mmbtu behind on a month to date basis. 
Please increase our nomination immediately and stay on top of it. As I sent 
you earlier today, current volumes are over 14,000 mmbtu/day which generates 
11,900 mmbtu/day for our share on a current basis. The addition of 9600 over 
20 days adds 480/day for a total nom of 12,380 mmbtu/day (SEC/Cheyenne) 
subject to daily change of production.

This is to request that Spinnaker's nomination for the VR 375 well(s) be
lowered from the current nom of 11,728 mmbtu to 7443 mmbtu, effective start
of day on 11/21/00.

The reduction is necessary as a result of the SI of the well on Friday,
11/17/00, through the current time, Monday, 11/20/00, combined with shut-ins
that occurred on 11/13 and 11/14.

This nomination volume is based on an assumed rate of 12,700 through the end
of the month.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

Marilyn Gullette

Nelson,
As you know, Grand Cheniere was under maintenance in October and we had to 
shut in Johson Bayou.   Francis wants us to reallocate (trespass gas) that 
they continued to flow onto ANR in the amout of  54,536mm to us  at an agreed 
upon price of $5.20.   ANR has agreed to do this next week.  Since you are 
out today Francis asked us to make sure you called him about this as well as 
another issue.  
Mark

																												financial  strength and keep up with the 3%annual growth in Wisconsin's  
electricity demand. The plan, pending regulatory approval, aims to  build at 
least one 500 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired unit and  at least two 600 
MW coal-fired units over the next decade, for a  total of 1,700 MW. More 
units may be built after 2010, eventually  raising new generation capacity in 
the state to around 3,000 MW.  Wisconsin Public Service also hopes to add to 
the state's power grid  by building the Arrowhead-Weston line, a 250-mile 345 
kilovolt  transmission line from Minnesota to central Wisconsin. The line  
would directly link Wisconsin to power supplies in Canada and North  Dakota, 
easing transmission bottlenecks to the west and south.  Wisconsin imports up 
to 20% of its power.

																														Demand Exceeds BPA Supply BPA 
																														
																														? ? Customer demand under new 10-year wholesale  power contracts with the BPA 
is so strong that the agency must  purchase power on the open market to 
augment its supply. To recover  the cost of these purchases, it proposes to 
tack a 15% charge onto  wholesale rates effective next October. Even with an 
additional  charge, BPA's wholesale rates are still well below wholesale 
market  prices currently forecast for the next five years on the West Coast.  
BPA signed new wholesale contracts last week with more than 130  Northwest 
utilities and industries for 10-years. Those agreements  pushed its total 
firm energy load? up to 11,000 MW. That is  almost 3000 MW more than the 
federal Columbia River Power System can  generate on a firm basis.

Hi Tom,

I need your Help!

 Wisconsin Gas Company invoices us for 236,646 mmbtu for Sept. production on 
ANR pipe.
However, the deals in Unify totalled 209,600 mmbut for ANR pipe, Sept. 
production a difference of 27,035 mmbtu.

It appears that volume purchased at the following points is not reflected in 
unify:
 
 Burlington  3,370
 Centerville             45
 Menominee Falls    605
 Milwaukee              13,725
 New London                2,605
 Southeastern    900
 Steven Point                2,730
 West Bend    855
    _____
    27,035

Please advise of a Sitara deal number.

Thanks
Valerie Curtis

P.S. I faxed copies of p/L support supporting the above 27,035 mmbtu, 
11/03/00.

																									CFTC  Report Shows Speculators Neutral on Energy Futures 
																									
																									
																									
																									?  ? ?Speculators maintained a neutral position on crude and  heating oil 
futures for the week ending last Tuesday, having cut  bets on rising prices 
they made a few weeks ago, according to the  CFTC report. The neutral posture 
helps to explain why the market has  had trouble getting out of the recent 
price range. As a group, the  hedge funds are not looking for a rally or a 
big decline, they're  just watching for fresh indicators. Crude oil prices 
have been  between about $32 and $34 per barrel on the NYMEX since 
mid-October,  after a brief rally to $37. Prices closed Friday at $32.71 per  
barrel. Speculators had bought 39,480 crude oil contracts and sold  40,373 
contracts, giving them a net short position of 893 contracts.  The funds held 
net-long positions for most of the year, with a peak  of 47,171 lots in 
February. Similarly, speculators' heating oil bets  were almost neutral. Net 
long positions were 1,436 lots after  declining every week from a high for 
the year of 25,780 lots on  September 12th. The following table shows the 
changes.

																											New  Pipeline Interconnection to Offer Canadian Supply
																											
																											
																											
																											?  ? Empire State Pipeline and the National Fuel Gas have  completed a new 
Canadian pipeline interconnection at Pendleton, NY,  allowing natural gas to 
flow to the US from Canada. The volumes from  Canada could flow to the 
Buffalo area market as well as to NFG's  interconnects with Tennessee Gas 
Pipeline in East Aurora, NY and  Ellisburg, PA; Dominion Transmission in 
Ellisburg; and  Transcontinental Pipeline and TETCO at Leidy. Empire Pipeline 
is  owned by ANR and Westcoast Energy's St. Clair Pipelines. ANR  Pipeline 
serves as the physical operator for Empire Pipeline, which  extends for about 
156 miles from Buffalo to Syracuse. Most of the  natural gas will come from 
Western Canada, and the new pipeline will  give more flexibility and supply 
options for Empire's shippers.

																										Rotary Rig Counts Down 
																										
																										
																										
																										?  ? The number of rigs exploring for oil and natural gas in North  America 
fell by 8 for the week ending November 3rd, according to  Baker Hughes. The 
number of rigs operating in the US fell by 6 to  763 to 1,078 compared to 763 
a year ago. The number of rigs in  Canada fell by 2 to 362, compared with 
last year's 336. In the Gulf  of Mexico, the number of rigs searching for oil 
and natural gas fell  by 3 to 148 compared to 113 last year. The number of US 
rigs  searching for oil rose by 4 to 232, while the number searching for  
natural gas fell by 10 to 845. The number of US rigs exploring on  land fell 
5 to 906, while the number operating offshore fell by 3 to  152. The number 
in inland waters rose by 2 to 20.? There were  250 US rigs exploring 
directionally, 68 exploring horizontally, and  760 exploring vertically. The 
weekly rig count reflects the number  of rigs exploring for oil and natural 
gas, not those producing.

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20

 a=20
project team, representing Enron=01,s temporary staffing users, have resear=
ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=

would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA),=

Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the=

Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=
roup=20
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=
=20
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online=20

=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

t=20
interests of the organization.=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20

=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=

What is Managed Services?

Please refrain from running reports on the EnronOnline databases between 7 am 
- 2 pm CST / 1pm - 8pm GMT, which is our peak usage period.

These reports slow down EnronOnline trading.

We will have a solution to this problem within the next few weeks, but in the 
meantime, we appreciate your cooperation with the above.

Thanks,

																									Governments Negotiate Differences in The  Hague
																									
																									? ? 
																									After a week  of preliminary talks that failed to resolve differences over 
how  best to protect the planet, government leaders have arrived to  bargain 
over the toughest aspects of curbing emissions. About 2,000  lower level 
officials did what they could to prepare for the final  week of negotiations 
among environment ministers or cabinet-rank  officers from at least 150 
countries. The US feels its effort to  find common ground and be flexible has 
not been returned by?  European counterparts. The US has been singled out for 
criticism for  its effort to reduce its commitments. The government 
essentially  agreed to Kyoto because they agreed to the flexibility 
mechanisms  such as emissions trading, now the US is running into trouble 
with  that. If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a  new 
global code of behavior on emissions will require ratification  by most of 
the industrial countries. Without a US endorsement, it  would be difficult 
for such a treaty to come into force. The US  Senate already has passed a 
resolution making its ratification  conditional on assurances that the 
nation's competitiveness on world  markets will not be harmed. A select group 
of leading policy makers  held informal closed-door talks in The Hague ahead 
of a ceremony  Monday marking the start of the critical second phase of the  
conference. The politicians are working toward a comprehensive plan  to 
reduce the Earth's output of heat-trapping gasses from  businesses, farms and 
automobiles, without bloating national budgets  or hampering the global 
economy. A board of 2,000 leading  scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, projects  that in the coming 100 years there will be more 
rainfall, a  temperature increase of up to 11 degrees Fahrenheit and a 
sea-level  rise of up to 30 inches. An agreement reached in 1997 in Kyoto,  
Japan, called for a worldwide reduction of carbon-based gas  emissions by an 
average 5.2% below 1990 levels. The target date for  the reductions was 2012. 
Europe is committed to cutting emissions  8%, Japan 6% and the US 7%.

never  articulated clearly a requirement that a party exercising a  
contractual termination right must demonstrate that termination is  
consistent with the public interest, according to Dynegy. It also  argued 
that it has not refused to participate in an RTO; it merely  seeks to join 
one that adequately protects its legitimate financial  interests and also 
represents a significant improvement to the  status quo for other market 
participants. Dynegy urged FERC to limit  its decision on whether or not the 
company can leave the ISO to the  facts, not on the uproar Dynegy's actions 
have caused in the  Midwest. Regulators in Illinois and Michigan have

Here is the contract information.  The contract group could not locate the

For the GTC and GISB contracts that have no paper, I wrote price and location

																													Alberta's Oil and Natural? Gas Revenue Doubles  
																													
																													
																													
																													?  ? Alberta's revenue from oil and natural gas will more than  double this 
year to about C$8.7 billion. It will use most of the  money to cut its debt. 
Alberta, the biggest international supplier  of natural gas to the US, will 
pay down its debt by C$4.5 billion  this year and give residents C$485 
million in tax and energy-bill  rebates. Alberta is expecting a C$4.2 billion 
budget surplus in the  fiscal year ending March 31. Alberta collects a 
percentage of  revenue from oil and natural gas produced in the province. 
The  province's debt, now around C$12.5 billion, rose when prices were  low. 
Alberta's low debt and its repayment program have earned it the  highest 
credit rating of any Canadian province.

																														Canadian 88 Losses Increase
																														
																														? 
																														
																														?  ? Canadian 88 Energy, which has put itself up for sale, says  its third 
quarter loss widened seven-fold because of production  problems and an 
ill-fated natural gas hedging program. It reported  the loss grew to C$5.2 
million. Cash flow, a key indicator a firm's  ability to fund future 
exploration, fell 64% to C$2.3 million from  C$6.4 million. The third quarter 
results reflected the one-time  impact of the upgrading program at the Olds 
Gas Plant, which  shut-in? 26 MMcf per day of natural gas and 770 barrels of  
liquids daily from September 5th until October 7th. Most Canadian  firms have 
been big winners in the natural gas market, but not  Canadian 88, whose 
natural gas hedging reduced cash flow by $26  million in the quarter.

Flood Relief in Massive floods in recent weeks have devastated much of the 
Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and as much help as possible
Vietnam is needed to help the millions of victims driven out by the natural 
disaster.  Thousands of people have died and the main 
 food source, rice, has been destroyed.  Homes and crops are not expected to 
recover until well after next year. Food, 
 water, and shelter are all in extremely short supply.  Every bit of help can 
make a huge difference!

 For information on how to support this important cause, contact Thu Pham 
Arnold at ext. 55125. Donations to 
 the flood relief can be made to:
 
 VCSA Flood Relief
 Vietnamese Culture & Science Association
 P.O. Box 741301
 Houston, TX 77247

																? ? TotalFinaElf plans to construct a natural gas  gathering project with its 
north American partners in the Gulf of  Mexico, enabling the development of 
three deep offshore natural gas  fields. The project consisted of a 56-mile 
pipeline with a  transmission capacity of 500 MMcf per day and a processing 
platform,  owned and operated by Williams.? Construction of the Canyon  
Express pipeline, in the Mississippi Canyon area about 120 miles  southeast 
of New Orleans, will begin next year. The gathering system  will begin 
operating in summer 2002, at the same time as the three  natural gas fields, 
Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden Hills. Canyon  Express was a major 
technological breakthrough for TotalFinaElf,  making it possible to undertake 
oil and natural gas operations at  previously untapped depths of over 6,000 
feet. The gas gathering  system will be operated by Elf Exploration and 
belong to the  companies who owned the Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden 
Hills  fields. Aconcagua is operated by Elf Exploration which has a 50%  
stake in the field. Enron affiliate, Mariner Energy, and Pioneer  Natural

Effective November 21, 2000, there will be a new procedure for lunch.  EOL 
traders and deskheads will eat first.  Then, your assistant will notify you 
when the rest of the traders can eat.   This new procedure is to ensure the 
EOL traders will not be away from their desk a long period time during 
lunch.   

Thank you for your cooperation.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I would like to remind you that only postID of calcs that have TDS Flag (in 
Port Calc screen) set to "1" are included in TDS position load.  We have 
noticed that ST-Bammel, ST-Bridgeline, GD-Texas,... and many more desks do 
not have the TDS Flag set to "1".

Please call me (x30413) or Bill Kasemervisz (x57579) if you have any 
questions.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will 
strive to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.


Thanks,
Enron Global Messaging Team

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

Tom,

I am an analyst with Metals Origination in London and got your name from 
David Oliver.  Enron Metals is in the process of dealing with White Pine 
Copper Refinery in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  One of the options we 
are reviewing is returning a dormant generator to operation and selling the 
excess power.  Natural gas is delivered to White Pine through an Enron 
pipeline.  The generator can run on either natural gas or coal.  Several 
years ago ('96 or '97), Enron contacted White Pine (previously owned by BHP 
Copper White Pine Refinery) on numerous occasions about running the 
powerhouse on gas and they would get the excess power to market.  The idea at 
the time was they had excess natural gas and wanted White Pine to run the 
generators on gas.  Would you know anything about this deal or who the 
originator was?  If so, could you or the originator please contact me 
regarding the details.  If not, could you please direct me to someone who may 
know about the original proposal?

Regards,

Bucky Dusek

																						agreed governments will promote more trade and investment,  70% agreed that 
globally consistent accounting principles will be  established by 2010, and 
over 80% believed the companies dominating  the utility business in 2010 will 
be multi-national. Those results  validate the strategies of companies using 
mergers and acquisitions  to create global giants. However, events such as 
the IMF protests in  Prague and WTO protests in Seattle this year highlight 
what could be  growing opposition to globalization. Politics can veer off in  
unexpected directions, so it is unwise to be so committed to any one  view of 
where voters and government policy are moving that you lack  contingency 
plans. Utilities can minimize their risk in this  uncertain era, while at the 
same time moving forward decisively.  They can use management tools such as 
scenario-based planning, real  options valuation, and computer modeling - 
these approaches provide  the means 
																						
																						
																						
																						
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			for understanding the array of strategies available and for  defining the 
significance of choosing one or the other.  Additionally, the studies show 
that utilities need systems,  processes, and a culture that make them 
versatile - that permit them  to nurture 'just-in-case' technologies, 
products, and businesses,  spot leading indicators of change, and switch 
strategies without  confusion and delay. The two reports are segments of The 
Utility  Executive's Field Guide to the Future. Part 1 summarizes the 
results  of a global survey of 185 decision makers in utilities,  
corporations, and engineering firms in 15 countries, while Part 2  focuses on 
the outlook for regulatory policy and globalization. Part  2 is based not 
only on the survey results but also on 75 subsequent  interviews with utility 
CEOs, power managers in large corporations,  government officials, and others 
around the world. The research also  included an intensive review of economic 
studies, government  reports, opinion surveys, and other sources. For more

																								?  ? Standard & Poor's has issued a CreditWatch update  indicating that the 
rating on the $146.6 million senior secured  notes issued by the Express 
pipeline project could be adversely  affected. AEC has exercised its option 
for the purchase of  TransCanada's 50% interest in the Express Pipeline 
Project and  Marquest, a marketing vehicle directly and indirectly owned 
equally  by AEC and TransCanada. The project is a 1,717-mile-long pipeline  
that runs from Hardisty, Alberta to Wood River, Illinois.

from October, having been set at $4.31 per MMBtu as against  October's price 
of $5.11 per MMBtu, according to the CRE. The  decrease is the largest 
monthly fall in the price of natural gas so  far this year and leaves the 
price at a level comparable to that of  six months ago, the CRE said.

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

On-Line Natural Gas Reverse Auction

? ? 
The East Coast  Natural Gas Cooperative has secured over 25 Bcf of natural 
gas for  several Northeast distributors in an auction that worked in 
reverse.  For the first time, the ECNGC staged a reverse auction where it is  
the potential sellers who bid - downward - to win a sale to a buyer.  Nearly 
50 packages of natural gas demand were on the procurement  block at various 
times during the 4-day auction period, conducted  last week.

Since Bruce Ferrel, the designated system administrator for Enron, is no
longer with your company I am addressing this issue to you. We obviously
need to change the administrator of the system as soon as possible. In
addition, I have sent over the new appendix's we spoke about yesterday to
your attention.
Today we had a situation where Dick Jenkins (Enron employee)hit a flat GDD
bid at Transco Z-6 for Dec 2000. He actually was logged in under Scott
Hendrickson's ID. Soon after the trade occurred, Mr. Jenkins called and
informed me that he had made a mistake and that he wanted the deal
cancelled. I informed him of the Manifest Error penalty associated with that
step. By the way the penalty associated with a manifest is $15,000. Mr.
Jenkins informed me that he wanted the trade cancelled but would not pay the
fee.
The Amendment to the Subscription Agreement dated June 23, 1999 describes
the Manifest Error process and all fees associated with it. Altra enforces
this language on all subscribers to the system in order to ensure the
integrity of our trading platform.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713-210-8278.


Sincerely,
Scott Coleman

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Subject: Erroneous Messages sent by Andrew Wu/HOU/EES on Wednesday, October 
25th

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will 
strive to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.


Thanks,
Enron Global Messaging Team

																					US  Negotiates at Climate Meeting 
																					
																					
																					? ?  At the UN conference in the Hague, environmental groups are accusing  
the US of seeking loopholes to avoid cutting pollution. The  conference 
opened to set rules for reducing harmful gases released  into the atmosphere. 
One major issue revolved around how much  countries could trade off against 
their commitments to roll back  their own pollution by helping other 
countries reduce theirs or by  planting new forests to absorb greenhouse 
gases. The US advocates  unlimited emissions trading, but the EU and some 
developing  countries fear it will defeat the effort to force the biggest  
polluters to change their ways. The US argues that emissions trading  is the 
most cost-effective way to meet the global target of reducing  greenhouse 
gases by 5.2% from 1990 levels, and would give time for  the transition to 
cleaner energy and expensive new technologies.  About 6,000 bureaucrats, 
scientists, environmentalists and  businessmen attended the opening. That 
number was expected to grow  to 10,000 during the second week with the 
arrival of 100 government  ministers for the culmination of negotiations. 
Months of talks have  preceded the conference. Three years ago at Kyoto, 
governments drew  up targets for rolling back emissions of carbon-based gases 
but  could not agree on the details. Europe agreed to cut emissions by  8%, 
the US by 7% and Japan by 6%. Each was allowed to decide how it  would make 
the required reductions. So far, 30 countries have  ratified the Kyoto 
Protocol. Mexico is the most industrialized  country on the list, and none is 
among the heaviest polluting  countries. The agreement needs the ratification 
of 55 countries,  representing at least 55% of the harmful emissions, before 
it will  come into force.

the plants with stock  and debt. The purchase is expected to close in the

Effective immediately, there is a change to the Stack Manager which will 
affect Inactive Children.

Inactive Children with links to Parent products will not have their 
calculated prices updated until the Child product is Activated.

When the Child Product is activated, the price will be recalculated and 
updated BEFORE it is displayed on the web.

This means that if you are inputting a basis price on a Child product, you 
will not see the final, calculated price until you Activate the product, at 
which time the customer will also see it.

If you have any questions, please contact the Help Desk on:
