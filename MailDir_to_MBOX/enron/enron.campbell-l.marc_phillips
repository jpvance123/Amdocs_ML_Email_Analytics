Below is an update on the status of the grandfather legislation. Changes from 
previous versions include a 30% reduction for oil and gas facilities instead 
of 20% and an extension of the voluntary program until 9/2002 instead of 
9/2001. I asked Skip Dees if that meant TNRCC would allow companies to 
"authorize" grandfathered sources under old exemptions for a year longer and 
his response is below. His suggestion is to act now (as is mine). 


Skip's e-mail response: "If the Sunset Bill passes with the current 
grandfathered facility language (and there is no guarantee of that - it ain't 
gonna get any better, and it could get worse), we'd have till 9/1/02 to apply 
for a VERP-type permit with
10-year old BACT.  The deal on applying historical PBR's to grandfathered
facilities is a TNRCC letter interpretation, and that COULD change at any
time.  If that option works for you, I'd jump on it NOW."

		 Subject: Grandfathered Facilities - Endangered Species With No Prospects o f 
Protection


The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered.  This does not
only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas, but ANY facility
that was constructed prior to September, 1971 and has not subsequently been
rolled into some sort of new source review (NSR) permit or Permit by Rule
(formerly Standard Exemption).  Note that proposed new rules recently
published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to
be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all
facilities authorized by a Permit by Rule/Standard Exemption, much the same
as is required for any other type of permit.

The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such
facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort.  The Senate
Committee Substitute (SCS) for HB 2912 is a little stricter than the version
passed by the House, but both versions did contain grandfathered facility
permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will
also.  If this version passes, you will have one additional year to apply
for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit (VERP).  If your facility is a
pipeline facility, the TNRCC will require no more than a 30% reduction in
NOx, and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same
area covered in one permit.

Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly
Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP - that it looks as though
we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted
without having to use today's BACT.

This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information.  This is NOT
actual bill language - I've TRIED to make it easier to read.

Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not
concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to
Conference.  In addition, we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on
the Senate floor to require shutdown on September 1, 2001 of grandfathered
facilities that do not have a pending permit application.  If that attempt
is successful, the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September
1.

The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current
opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule (Standard Exemptions) as a
means of permitting a grandfathered facility.  I am not certain how long
this opportunity will continue to exist.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU
CAN.

In addition, I've appended some information on 10-year old BACT for
gas-fired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to
get a VERP now.




PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB 2912 (PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE)

Sec. 382.05181.  PERMIT REQUIRED.

(a)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending
for a new source review permit or other authorization, other than a federal
operating permit, and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as
provided in Section 382.05182 may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2003, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(b)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other
authorization under this chapter, other than a federal operating permit
permit, may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2007, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(c)  Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are
subject to the permitting deadlines in Section 382.05184.

Sec. 382.05182.  NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN.

(a)  A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility
beyond the deadlines of 382.05181(a) must be filed with the commission
before the applicable deadline.

(b)  A notice under this section shall include:

  (1)  the date the facility intends to cease operating;

  (2)  an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that
will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate; and

  (3)  any other necessary and relevant information the
commission by rule deems appropriate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS (APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER 382.05183, 382.05184, AND
382.05186)

(a)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that
there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene
the intent of this chapter, including protection of the public's health and
physical property.

(b)  If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not
comply with Subsection (c), the commission may not grant the permit under
this section.

(c)  A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted
under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements
before modifying.

(d)  The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer
this section.

(e)  If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect
information in an application, the applicant shall submit the relevant facts
or correct the information no later than 60 days after discovering the
error.  If while processing the application, the commission determines that
additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on
the application, the commission may request the information and set a
reasonable deadline for a response.  Failure to comply with the deadline for
the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant.

Sec. 382.05183.  EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT.

(a)  The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a
permit to operate the facility under this section.

(b)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that the
application:

  (1)  is filed before September 1, 2002 and the facility will
use an air pollution control method at least as effective as 10-year old
BACT; or

  (2)  is filed before the applicable deadline of 382.05181(a)
and the facility will use current BACT.

(c)  The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some
or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site.  Permits issued under this
subsection shall follow the same permit issuance, modification, and renewal
procedures as existing facility permits.

Sec. 382.05184.  SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT.

(a)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an
annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section
before September 1, 2005.

(b)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source
review permit or other authorization, other than a federal operating permit,
and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown, may not emit air
contaminants on or after September 1, 2007.

Sec.  382.05185.  ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT.

Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating
facilities are not outlined in this memo.

Sec. 382.05186.  AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES.

(a)  The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications
for grandfathered processing, treating, compression, or pumping facilities
connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(b)  Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local,
regional, and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to
federal air quality standards, the commission may require up to a 30%
reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating
internal combustion engines subject to this section.  For facilities other
than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part
of a gathering or transmission pipeline , the commission may consider
requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to 30% for NOx and 20% for
VOC.  The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state
where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than
in other areas, but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate
may be required in any area.

(c)  The commission shall:

  (1)  allow for a single permit for all facilities connected
to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline;

  (2)  allow for required reductions for facilities under this
section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one
facility and located in the same local, regional, or statewide areas
designated by the commission under Subsection (b);

  (3)  for purposes of emission averaging, allow emission
reductions achieved from grandfathered since September 1, 1997; and

  (4)  allow an owner or operator to apply for separate
permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to
or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(d)  Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted
under this chapter.




CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO "PERMIT" A GRANDFATHERED
FACILITY

TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered
facilities using any applicable "Permit by Rule," including those previously
referred to as Standard Exemptions.

For instance, old Standard Exemption 7, effective May 8, 1972, was for "Gas
fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine trains of
less than 5000 hp total" and can be used to permit any such engine(s).  For
clarification on this particular exemption, the language used by staff in
proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in 1972 was as
follows:  "Engines smaller than 2000 hp are quite numerous and are not
considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES (emphasis
added) to form an engine train.  Engine trains of less than 5000 hp are not
considered a substantial source.  Because control technology for NOx
emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited, it
is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit
system at this time."  ("Exemptions From Permits Procedures and
Justification for Exemptions," <signed> Charles R. Barden, P.E., Executive
Secretary, Texas Air Control Board, May 8, 1972.)

A list of the "Historical Standard Exemptions" is available on the TNRCC
Website at http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html
<http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html> .  In
applying these "Permits by Rule," be sure to check the corresponding
"Exemption Preambles" (if any) for any applicable General Conditions.

TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities
by PI-8 AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will
have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer
considered to be grandfathered.  The registration will buy you a letter of
acknowledgement that you have claimed the "permit by rule" (don't use the
term "exemption" in any correspondence) for these engines.




CORRESPONDENCE WITH TNRCC ON 10-YEAR OLD BACT FOR GAS ENGINES AND TURBINES

Subject: Response to 11/21/00 Teleconference 001204

I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC
will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year BACT
for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.  The
last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this
email.  It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from
Jim Linville.  In response to a request from us, Jim Linville sets forth in
his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the 29 gram per
horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the 2-8 gram level and
what the owner/operator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a
VERP permit.
Remember, that in order to be included in the TNRCC's January 15, 2001
report to the legislature, a letter of intent or application for a VERP
should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday, December 7, 2000.
To summarize, we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC:
1. Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than 2000
horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No. 6 effective December
1, 1972, regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities. (See my
letter to Kerry Drake dated September 15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me
dated October 3, 2000).
2. Grandfathered engine trains of less than 5000 horsepower, or a
portion of an engine train up to 5000 horsepower may be authorized under
Standard Exemption No. 6, December 1, 1972, so long as each engine in the
train does not exceed 2000 horsepower.  (See my letter to James Randall
dated November 1, 2000 and Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
3. Grandfathered turbines of less than 20,000 horsepower may be
authorized by Standard Exemption No. 82, dated December 1, 1972 regardless
of the level of emissions.  (See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September
15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me dated October 3, 2000).
4. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to
the 2-8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review.
(See James Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
5. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be
controlled to the 2-8 gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is
test data to validate the old (pre-modification) and new (post-modification)
emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions
would be achieved.  Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the
controls and even though additional modifications are available, the
additional cost is prohibitive. (See Jim Randall's letter to me dated
November 16, 2000 and the email attached hereto).

I hope all of this is helpful.  I have forwarded to you copies of the
referenced letters by fax on earlier dates.  If you need another copy please
let me know.

Subject: Response to 11/21/00 Teleconference

Celina and James,

During our teleconference today, you asked for an example of what we would
consider "significant emission reductions" that would be acceptable in a
case-by-case review when the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level could not be achieved.
A large 2-stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately 29 g/hp-hr
of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if
actual emissions are reduced by 50 percent even though it does not meet the
2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level.  We would agree that this would have been
considered BACT 10 years ago if there was test data to validate the old
(pre-modification) and new (post-modification) emission rates to document
that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved.  Also
needed in the case-by-case review would be a representation of what the cost
of the controls would be with a discussion of why the  2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx
level could not be achieved.  This may be due to technical limitations such
as no additional controls or modifications are possible, or you may identify
cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though
additional modifications are available, the cost is prohibitive.

Subject: letter from TNRCC re 10-yr BACT

I received by fax late yesterday evening, a letter signed by John Steib re
10-yr BACT guidelines for engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.
After my first read, it looks pretty good.  Look for a copy of it by fax.
Let me know if you have any comments or concerns that we need to clear up
with the TNRCC.

Re: Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion
  Engines and Turbines

Dear Ms. Romero:

As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for
grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines, we have agreed that
some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 or 82,
effective on December 1, 1972 and others may be permitted under 30 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 116, Subchapter H:  Voluntary Emission
Reduction Permits (VERP).  Specific questions raised are discussed below.

You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an "engine train
of less than 5,000 hp." In your November 1, 2000 letter you gave two
examples of "engine trains" that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No.
6, "Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine
trains of less than 5,000 hp total."  We agree that several engines, each
less than 2000 hp, can be combined into a "train" providing compression to a
common header so long as the train does not exceed 5,000 hp, meet the
exemption requirements.  In cases where the total horsepower in a train
exceeds 5,000 hp, we will allow exemption of individual engines within such
a train provided that each engine is less than 2000 hp and the total
horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed 5,000 hp.  In
the same standard exemption list, turbines were covered by Standard
Exemption No. 82, "Gas turbines of less than 20,000 hp burning sweet natural
gas."

The other major point of discussion has been the determination of "10 year
old BACT" required by 30 TAC o116.811(3)(A).  As we discussed, our review of
permitting 10 years ago reveals that very few, if any, old engines were
permitted; so no data is available to show what we would have required for
nitrogen oxides (NOX) best available control technology (BACT).  New engines
were permitted at 2 grams/horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr) of NOX for both rich
burn and lean burn engines.  At that time older rich burn engines could have
been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g/hp-hr limit
for NOX.  Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both
2-stroke and 4-stroke versions are available, and no single method of
control is applicable.  The large number of different engine manufacturers,
and the availability of various models, makes it impossible to establish a
single 10 year old BACT level.  Some of the older engines may be capable of
being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of 5 to 8 g/hp-hr, the level
established in the 1992 revision of Standard Exemption No. 6, which also
established a 3 g/hp-hr standard for turbines.  While the standard exemption
does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available.
Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high
as 25 to 29 g/hp-hr, so significant emission reductions may be achievable
even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of 2 to 8
g/hp-hr.  The 10 year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will
have to be done on a case-by-case basis just as we would have done 10 years
ago.

We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they
will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit
their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December 7,
2000.

For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for
authorization under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 and 82, please identify the
specific engines and turbines, identified by unit number, emission point
number (EPN), air quality account number, and plant name; and for each
account please submit a Form PI-7.  For each engine or turbine, please
submit a, Table 29 or 31 as applicable, and other technical information that
will support the standard exemption claim.

For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit, please identify each
engine by unit number, EPN, air quality account number, and plant name, and
provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a
result of participation in the VERP program.  When the VERP applications are
submitted, information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be
in the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr range.  If it is not possible to achieve this level of
emissions, please submit information that shows that it is not technically
feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level.
Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved, even
when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g/hp-hr cannot be met, will be helpful in
staff review of the application.

We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a
success.  If you have any further questions, please contact Mr. James
Randall, P.E. at (512) 239-1078.

The answer to your question is that all emissions reported on the emissions 
inventory should be included in the calculation of emissions fees. This leads 
to another question-what emissions should be reported on the emissions 
inventory?

I discussed this issue with a TNRCC emissions inventory team leader. He 
informed me that that is no written guidance on how to report upset, 
maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions on the emissions inventory, and 
as a result be included in emission fees. He did indicate that at previous 
emissions inventory workshops, attendees were verbally told to only include 
"reportable" (emissions that exceed RQ) on their inventories, and not  
"recordable" (non-reportable) emissions. He also mentioned that one ton/year 
would also be an acceptable threshold for including emissions in the 
inventory.

He is aware that  upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions are an 
important issue, now that they are included in fees. He indicated that TNRCC 
will be putting out definitive information on this issue in future emissions 
inventory workshops and guidance, in preparation for submittal of calendar 
year 2001 inventories that will be due in 2002.

Subject: TNRCC Emission Fees

In the last session, legislation was passed in Texas that requires the 
payment of emission fees for upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown 
emissions. Previously these emissions were required to be included in 
emission inventories, but not when calculating the fees. Funds generated by 
the inclusion of these emissions are to be used by TNRCC for enforcement and 
monitoring activities for air quality permitting, air quality assessment and 
planning, and enforcement and compliance support. 
TNRCC is requiring that the additional fees for upset, maintenance, start-up, 
and shutdown emissions be included in the fees that are due this Fall for 
calendar year 2000 emissions. Industry groups are questioning the legality of 
TNRCC requiring the added fees for 2000 emissions since the effective date of 
the legislation was September, 2001. TNRCC is being requested to change this 
and legal action is being considered. I will keep you updated as this issue 
develops.

The TNRCC Sunset legislation,  including the grandfather provisions, has been 
sent to the Governor and will likely be signed. I am providing a quick 
summary of this bill since you may be discussing it next week in Houston. I 
will be attending a TXOGA pipeline committee meeting on June 5 where it will 
be discussed in detail, and will provide more information after that meeting.

The Bill divides the state into two regions. East Texas is all counties east 
of I-35 (north of San Antonio) and north of I-37 (south of San Antonio) that 
transverse these highways. This region includes Nueces County. West Texas is 
the rest of the state.

In East Texas, you must apply for a permit for grandfathered emission sources 
by September 1, 2003 and comply with the permit by March 1, 2007. In West 
Texas you must apply by September 1, 2004 and comply with the permit by March 
1, 2008. The control requirements in the permit, except for pipeline 
reciprocating engines, will be based on 10-year old BACT.

There are specific provisions for pipeline reciprocating engines. In East 
Texas, 50% reductions of NOx and VOC will be required. In West Texas, 0% to 
20% reductions of NOx and VOC will be required. You will have the flexibility 
to attain these reductions on a per engine basis or can average over multiple 
engines. A $16.2 million fund has been established by Reliant to partially 
finance the cost of compliance with the pipeline engine requirements in East 
Texas.

As you are aware, the cost impact of this legislation can be greatly reduced 
by "authorizing" as many grandfathered emission sources as possible under old 
standard exemptions as per the October 3, 2000 letter from TNRCC. Most 
grandfathered engines, tanks, dehys etc. can be authorized via old 
exemptions. Previously TNRCC indicated verbally that this method of 
authorizing grandfathered sources would be available until September 1, 2001, 
but TNRCC can change this date (move it up or move it back).

I was at a TXOGA meeting last week and I was informed that TNRCC is only 
receiving a small percentage of the Title V Compliance Certification forms 
that they are supposed to be receiving from companies with Title V operating 
permits. Remember that Compliance Certification forms are due in Texas 30 
days after the anniversary of the date your operating permit was issued. 
TNRCC is not notifying companies that the forms are not being received. If 
you need the forms you can obtain them from TNRCC's web site at:

http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/opd/formswp.htm#compl

They are under the "Compliance and Reporting Form" section. Deviation Forms 
(for reporting noncompliance with federally enforceable regulations) can also 
be obtained at this location.

EPA released their urban strategy for their Air Toxics Program, and they 
listed reciprocating engines as an area source they plan on regulated under 
the MACT regulations for formaldehyde. As you know, an area source is a 
location that emits less than 10 tons of any one Hazardous Air Pollutant 
(HAP) or 25 tons/year of all HAPs. This was a big surprise to industry. 

As expected they also listed oil and gas production as an area source they 
plan on regulating, but did not list transmission and storage dehydration, or 
turbines. They will regulate major sources for HAPs in all of these 
categories.

I attended a meeting on July 30 with the Texas Intrastate Pipeline 
Association where TNRCC personnel made a presentation on the implementation 
of the grandfather legislation and Charlie Child attended a meeting on August 
7 where TNRCC also made a presentation on the grandfather legislation. 

The following existing authorization options are available for grandfathered 
sources: old Standard Exemptions, Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP), regular permits or Permits By Rule.  The grandfather legislation, 
which is still in the rulemaking process, is for permitting grandfathered 
sources that have not been authorized by the existing options.  These 
programs are discussed below.

Old Standard Exemptions
As you know, ETS has implemented a program to authorize grandfathered 
emission sources under old Standard Exemptions (now Permits by Rule) wherever 
possible so they would not be subject to the grandfather regulations. TNRCC 
indicated at the meeting that you would have until the deadlines for 
submitting applications (9/1/03 in east Texas and 9/1/04 in West Texas) to 
authorize the sources under old St. Ex.  Keep in mind that this program is 
not part of the TNRCC regulations-it is being implemented under a verbal 
agreement with the TNRCC and could change at any moment.  TNRCC recommended 
that PI-7 forms be submitted for all locations that are included on their 
1997 list of emission sources (Note: the list is based on TNRCC's listing of 
1997 emissions inventories and Ruth has distributed this list to the 
appropriate DESs). For locations not on this list, internal records would be 
sufficient and nothing needs to be submitted to TNRCC (unless required under 
the conditions of the St.Ex.). One thing to keep in mind is that TNRCC is 
revising the rules governing Permits by Rule/St. Ex. with increased 
recordkeeping requirements so that any emission sources authorized by St.Ex. 
will be subject to the new recordkeeping rules (scheduled to be finalized on 
9/26/01).  It is recommended that the Standard Exemption submittals be 
received by the TNRCC as soon as possible.  In addition to engines, old 
Standard Exemptions or existing Permits By Rule should be used for the 
remaining grandfathered sources (tanks, heaters, etc.).

Grandfather Legislation
The grandfather legislation includes a specific permit for reciprocating 
engines.  Other grandfather sources must obtain an "Existing Facility Permit" 
under the legislation.  Unlike the Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP) program, there is no amnesty granted for modifications uncovered 
during the permitting process.  Discovery of a modification may result in 
enforcement action.  In addition, the source is no longer eligible for a 
grandfather permit and must obtain a regular permit or Permit By Rule and be 
subject to BACT (~2 g/bhp-hr).  In order to take advantage of the VERP 
program amnesty provision, TNRCC is urging industry to submit VERP 
applications by the August 31, 2001 deadline.

Under the grandfather legislation, grandfathered reciprocating engines in 
East Texas are subject to 50% reductions of NOx and may be subject to 50% 
reductions of VOC. Recips in West Texas are subject to up to 20% reductions 
of NOx and VOC. The reductions will be determined on a case-by case basis by 
the permit engineer reviewing the application. Although previously there was 
hope that no reductions would be required in West Texas, at the August 7 
meeting TNRCC indicated that they would require at least 1% reductions in 
West Texas. TNRCC has not decided how to deal with VOC reductions but one 
TNRCC staff member did mention he was aware that oxidation catalysts could 
reduce VOC emissions on engines.

In the August 7 meeting, TNRCC indicated that the reductions for recips will 
be calculated from a baseline of the average actual emissions in 1997-9. This 
was not the intent of the legislation and the legislators will be contacted 
by our industry organizations to attempt to change this. My thinking is that 
the reductions will likely be based on a "before" hourly grams/hp-hr rate 
from stack testing (or maybe AP-42) and an "after" hourly emissions rate 
based on stack testing. 

The reductions required from recips can be averaged across a pipeline, but 
reductions mandated by a regulation cannot be included. Reductions from a 
shutdown of an emission source can be included in the average, and it was 
suggested that reductions since 1997 could be included, but this has not been 
determined. It is highly unlikely that that TNRCC will allow reductions in 
East Texas to be averaged with reductions in West Texas.

Grandfathered emission sources other than recips are subject to 10-year old 
BACT. When discussing whether there would be any relief for smaller emission 
sources such as grandfathered valves or flanges, the TNRCC attorney indicated 
that there is no lower threshold and that all emissions sources must be 
authorized either by the existing authorizations or grandfather permits by 
the deadlines in  this legislation. See the notes above about the locations 
that TNRCC expects paperwork to be submitted for St. Ex.

The control/reduction deadlines for reducing emissions from all grandfathered 
emission sources is 3/1/07 in East Texas and 3/1/08 in West Texas. However 
TNRCC indicated that controls will likely be required prior to these dates. 
When you receive your permit for grandfathered sources, they anticipate that 
you will have 18 months to install controls. Since the applications are due 
on 9/1/03 and 9/1/04, and  TNRCC has one year to process applications (but it 
could be less), you should anticipate being required to install controls in 
2005-2007. The application fee may be $450.

The grandfather rule will be proposed on October 24, 2001 and should be 
finalized in March 2002.

The oil and gas production (O&G) and transmission and storage (T&S) MACT 
rules have been signed by EPA and should appear in the Federal Register very 
soon (late May or early June). You will have three years to comply for 
existing sources, but new sources must comply with these regulations as soon 
as the rules appear in the Federal Register. New sources, as defined in the 
regulations, are any dehys that were installed on or after February 6, 1998. 
I will be putting out an Environmental Notice about these rules, but if you 
have a dehy that was installed on or after February 6, 1998, contact me and 
we can discuss how to get that unit into compliance immediately. In addition 
to control requirements, you will have 120 days to notify EPA about any new 
sources.

Subject: Grandfathered Facilities - Endangered Species With No
Prospects of Protection

The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered.  This does not
only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas, but ANY facility
that was constructed prior to September, 1971 and has not subsequently been
rolled into some sort of new source review (NSR) permit or Permit by Rule
(formerly Standard Exemption).  Note that proposed new rules recently
published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to
be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all
facilities authorized by a Permit by Rule/Standard Exemption, much the same
as is required for any other type of permit.

The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such
facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort.  The Senate
Committee Substitute (SCS) for HB 2912 is a little stricter than the version
passed by the House, but both versions did contain grandfathered facility
permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will
also.  If this version passes, you will have one additional year to apply
for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit (VERP).  If your facility is a
pipeline facility, the TNRCC will require no more than a 30% reduction in
NOx, and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same
area covered in one permit.

Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly
Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP - that it looks as though
we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted
without having to use today's BACT.

This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information.  This is NOT
actual bill language - I've TRIED to make it easier to read.

Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not
concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to
Conference.  In addition, we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on
the Senate floor to require shutdown on September 1, 2001 of grandfathered
facilities that do not have a pending permit application.  If that attempt
is successful, the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September
1.

The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current
opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule (Standard Exemptions) as a
means of permitting a grandfathered facility.  I am not certain how long
this opportunity will continue to exist.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU
CAN.

In addition, I've appended some information on 10-year old BACT for
gas-fired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to
get a VERP now.




PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB 2912 (PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE)

Sec. 382.05181.  PERMIT REQUIRED.

(a)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending
for a new source review permit or other authorization, other than a federal
operating permit, and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as
provided in Section 382.05182 may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2003, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(b)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other
authorization under this chapter, other than a federal operating permit
permit, may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2007, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(c)  Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are
subject to the permitting deadlines in Section 382.05184.

Sec. 382.05182.  NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN.

(a)  A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility
beyond the deadlines of 382.05181(a) must be filed with the commission
before the applicable deadline.

(b)  A notice under this section shall include:

  (1)  the date the facility intends to cease operating;

  (2)  an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that
will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate; and

  (3)  any other necessary and relevant information the
commission by rule deems appropriate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS (APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER 382.05183, 382.05184, AND
382.05186)

(a)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that
there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene
the intent of this chapter, including protection of the public's health and
physical property.

(b)  If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not
comply with Subsection (c), the commission may not grant the permit under
this section.

(c)  A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted
under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements
before modifying.

(d)  The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer
this section.

(e)  If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect
information in an application, the applicant shall submit the relevant facts
or correct the information no later than 60 days after discovering the
error.  If while processing the application, the commission determines that
additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on
the application, the commission may request the information and set a
reasonable deadline for a response.  Failure to comply with the deadline for
the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant.

Sec. 382.05183.  EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT.

(a)  The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a
permit to operate the facility under this section.

(b)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that the
application:

  (1)  is filed before September 1, 2002 and the facility will
use an air pollution control method at least as effective as 10-year old
BACT; or

  (2)  is filed before the applicable deadline of 382.05181(a)
and the facility will use current BACT.

(c)  The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some
or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site.  Permits issued under this
subsection shall follow the same permit issuance, modification, and renewal
procedures as existing facility permits.

Sec. 382.05184.  SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT.

(a)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an
annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section
before September 1, 2005.

(b)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source
review permit or other authorization, other than a federal operating permit,
and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown, may not emit air
contaminants on or after September 1, 2007.

Sec.  382.05185.  ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT.

Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating
facilities are not outlined in this memo.

Sec. 382.05186.  AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES.

(a)  The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications
for grandfathered processing, treating, compression, or pumping facilities
connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(b)  Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local,
regional, and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to
federal air quality standards, the commission may require up to a 30%
reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating
internal combustion engines subject to this section.  For facilities other
than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part
of a gathering or transmission pipeline , the commission may consider
requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to 30% for NOx and 20% for
VOC.  The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state
where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than
in other areas, but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate
may be required in any area.

(c)  The commission shall:

  (1)  allow for a single permit for all facilities connected
to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline;

  (2)  allow for required reductions for facilities under this
section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one
facility and located in the same local, regional, or statewide areas
designated by the commission under Subsection (b);

  (3)  for purposes of emission averaging, allow emission
reductions achieved from grandfathered since September 1, 1997; and

  (4)  allow an owner or operator to apply for separate
permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to
or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(d)  Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted
under this chapter.




CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO "PERMIT" A GRANDFATHERED
FACILITY

TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered
facilities using any applicable "Permit by Rule," including those previously
referred to as Standard Exemptions.

For instance, old Standard Exemption 7, effective May 8, 1972, was for "Gas
fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine trains of
less than 5000 hp total" and can be used to permit any such engine(s).  For
clarification on this particular exemption, the language used by staff in
proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in 1972 was as
follows:  "Engines smaller than 2000 hp are quite numerous and are not
considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES (emphasis
added) to form an engine train.  Engine trains of less than 5000 hp are not
considered a substantial source.  Because control technology for NOx
emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited, it
is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit
system at this time."  ("Exemptions From Permits Procedures and
Justification for Exemptions," <signed> Charles R. Barden, P.E., Executive
Secretary, Texas Air Control Board, May 8, 1972.)

A list of the "Historical Standard Exemptions" is available on the TNRCC
Website at http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html
<http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html> .  In
applying these "Permits by Rule," be sure to check the corresponding
"Exemption Preambles" (if any) for any applicable General Conditions.

TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities
by PI-8 AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will
have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer
considered to be grandfathered.  The registration will buy you a letter of
acknowledgement that you have claimed the "permit by rule" (don't use the
term "exemption" in any correspondence) for these engines.

Subject: Response to 11/21/00 Teleconference 001204

I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC
will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year BACT
for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.  The
last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this
email.  It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from
Jim Linville.  In response to a request from us, Jim Linville sets forth in
his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the 29 gram per
horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the 2-8 gram level and
what the owner/operator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a
VERP permit.
Remember, that in order to be included in the TNRCC's January 15, 2001
report to the legislature, a letter of intent or application for a VERP
should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday, December 7, 2000.
To summarize, we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC:
1. Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than 2000
horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No. 6 effective December
1, 1972, regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities. (See my
letter to Kerry Drake dated September 15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me
dated October 3, 2000).
2. Grandfathered engine trains of less than 5000 horsepower, or a
portion of an engine train up to 5000 horsepower may be authorized under
Standard Exemption No. 6, December 1, 1972, so long as each engine in the
train does not exceed 2000 horsepower.  (See my letter to James Randall
dated November 1, 2000 and Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
3. Grandfathered turbines of less than 20,000 horsepower may be
authorized by Standard Exemption No. 82, dated December 1, 1972 regardless
of the level of emissions.  (See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September
15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me dated October 3, 2000).
4. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to
the 2-8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review.
(See James Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
5. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be
controlled to the 2-8 gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is
test data to validate the old (pre-modification) and new (post-modification)
emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions
would be achieved.  Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the
controls and even though additional modifications are available, the
additional cost is prohibitive. (See Jim Randall's letter to me dated
November 16, 2000 and the email attached hereto).

I hope all of this is helpful.  I have forwarded to you copies of the
referenced letters by fax on earlier dates.  If you need another copy please
let me know.

Celina and James,

During our teleconference today, you asked for an example of what we would
consider "significant emission reductions" that would be acceptable in a
case-by-case review when the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level could not be achieved.
A large 2-stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately 29 g/hp-hr
of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if
actual emissions are reduced by 50 percent even though it does not meet the
2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level.  We would agree that this would have been
considered BACT 10 years ago if there was test data to validate the old
(pre-modification) and new (post-modification) emission rates to document
that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved.  Also
needed in the case-by-case review would be a representation of what the cost
of the controls would be with a discussion of why the  2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx
level could not be achieved.  This may be due to technical limitations such
as no additional controls or modifications are possible, or you may identify
cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though
additional modifications are available, the cost is prohibitive.

Subject: letter from TNRCC re 10-yr BACT

I received by fax late yesterday evening, a letter signed by John Steib re
10-yr BACT guidelines for engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.
After my first read, it looks pretty good.  Look for a copy of it by fax.
Let me know if you have any comments or concerns that we need to clear up

Re: Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion
  Engines and Turbines

Dear Ms. Romero:

As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for
grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines, we have agreed that
some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 or 82,
effective on December 1, 1972 and others may be permitted under 30 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 116, Subchapter H:  Voluntary Emission
Reduction Permits (VERP).  Specific questions raised are discussed below.

You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an "engine train
of less than 5,000 hp." In your November 1, 2000 letter you gave two
examples of "engine trains" that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No.
6, "Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine
trains of less than 5,000 hp total."  We agree that several engines, each
less than 2000 hp, can be combined into a "train" providing compression to a
common header so long as the train does not exceed 5,000 hp, meet the
exemption requirements.  In cases where the total horsepower in a train
exceeds 5,000 hp, we will allow exemption of individual engines within such
a train provided that each engine is less than 2000 hp and the total
horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed 5,000 hp.  In
the same standard exemption list, turbines were covered by Standard
Exemption No. 82, "Gas turbines of less than 20,000 hp burning sweet natural
gas."

The other major point of discussion has been the determination of "10 year
old BACT" required by 30 TAC o116.811(3)(A).  As we discussed, our review of
permitting 10 years ago reveals that very few, if any, old engines were
permitted; so no data is available to show what we would have required for
nitrogen oxides (NOX) best available control technology (BACT).  New engines
were permitted at 2 grams/horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr) of NOX for both rich
burn and lean burn engines.  At that time older rich burn engines could have
been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g/hp-hr limit
for NOX.  Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both
2-stroke and 4-stroke versions are available, and no single method of
control is applicable.  The large number of different engine manufacturers,
and the availability of various models, makes it impossible to establish a
single 10 year old BACT level.  Some of the older engines may be capable of
being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of 5 to 8 g/hp-hr, the level
established in the 1992 revision of Standard Exemption No. 6, which also
established a 3 g/hp-hr standard for turbines.  While the standard exemption
does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available.
Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high
as 25 to 29 g/hp-hr, so significant emission reductions may be achievable
even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of 2 to 8
g/hp-hr.  The 10 year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will
have to be done on a case-by-case basis just as we would have done 10 years
ago.

We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they
will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit
their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December 7,
2000.

For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for
authorization under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 and 82, please identify the
specific engines and turbines, identified by unit number, emission point
number (EPN), air quality account number, and plant name; and for each
account please submit a Form PI-7.  For each engine or turbine, please
submit a, Table 29 or 31 as applicable, and other technical information that
will support the standard exemption claim.

For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit, please identify each
engine by unit number, EPN, air quality account number, and plant name, and
provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a
result of participation in the VERP program.  When the VERP applications are
submitted, information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be
in the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr range.  If it is not possible to achieve this level of
emissions, please submit information that shows that it is not technically
feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level.
Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved, even
when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g/hp-hr cannot be met, will be helpful in
staff review of the application.

We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a
success.  If you have any further questions, please contact Mr. James
Randall, P.E. at (512) 239-1078.

I went to the New Mexico ED's web site and downloaded their latest memo on 
turbine changeouts. I had not reviewed it recently and it appears that their 
policy has changed (for the worse). This new policy is definitely not an 
improvement and does not appear workable to me.

I attended a TXOGA pipeline committee meeting yesterday and the Grandfather 
legislation was discussed in detail. The following information is in addition 
to the previous message on this legislation:

Several members could not agree on whether the option being offered by TNRCC 
of using old standard exemptions to "authorize" grandfathered emission 
sources would be pulled off the table on September 1, 2001. The general 
consensus is that companies should complete the process of using the old 
exemptions by September 1 in case TNRCC does not allow this option anymore;

Although the legislation allows 0 to 20% reductions on pipeline engines in 
West Texas, TNRCC has indicated that they will not require reductions in West 
Texas, except for "huge emitters". No one knows what they mean by huge 
emitters;

TNRCC is required to reduce compressor engine NOx emissions by 50% in East 
Texas, but MAY require 50% VOC reductions in East Texas. No one has heard 
whether TNRCC will require VOC reductions. VOC reductions on a 2-cycle 
engine, especially on a Cooper engine with good combustion characteristics, 
could be problematic;

The TXOGA Pipeline committee will take the lead on responding to the 
regulations that are developed due to this legislation. I will certainly 
participate in this process.

Mike Riedel attended an API Workshop recently that included EPA presenters. 
EPA has changed their interpretation of the E& P, T & S MACT regulations that 
would have an impact on the registrations required in June of this year. The 
API representatives apparently agreed with the EPA interpretations. The 
Environmental Notice on the intranet will be changed to reflect these 
changes. 

Dehys  that are Major Sources for HAPs must be registered with EPA on June 
17, 2000. Previously it was understood that your Major Source status on June 
17, 2000 would determine if you register a facility. EPA has indicated that 
your status on June 17, 1999 would determine whether or not a site is 
registered.

For dehys regulated under the E & P MACT regulations (this does not impact 
the T & S MACT), you determine your major source status by first determining 
if the dehys at a location exceed 10 tons/year of any one HAP or 25 tons/year 
of all HAPs. If they do you must register the location with EPA. If not a 
Major Source because of dehys, you must then determine the HAP emissions from 
the greatest non-dehy source of HAP emissions (typically a recip engine). If 
the HAP emissions from this source alone exceed 10/25 tons/year, the location 
must be registered with EPA. If not you do not need to register. You no 
longer need to determine HAP emissions from the entire site to determine 
Major Source status.

If you have any questions, give me call at 713-646-7646.

The Texas Railroad Commission has posted new versions of two spill cleanup 
guidelines: 

Field Guide for the Assessment and Cleanup of Soil and Groundwater 
Contaminated with Condensate From a Spill Incident, and

Field Guide for Reportable Surface Releases of Crude Oil in Non-Sensitive 
Areas

on its web site at 
http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/divisions/og/notices-pubs-swr/notices/ogpn70.html. 
 Copies of the two quidelines in html formal are also attached to this notice.

The introductory page on the web site states: "To ensure consistent 
interpretation of Statewide Rules 8, 20, and 91, as they pertain to crude oil 
and condensate spills, the RRC has issued two field sampling guidance 
documents....Both of the field guides describe reporting, sampling and 
analysis requirements as well as provide the default cleanup concentrations.  
In all cases an apppropriate risk assessment may be used in lieu of the 
defaullt cleanup concentrations".

The guidelines are effective November 1, 2000.  The condensate guideline is 
temporary until the RBCA guidelines become available.  The Texas Railroad 
Commission plans to issue the RBCA guidelines by the end of this year.

Notes from TXOGA and TCC committee meetings:

Operating Permits - TNRCC is attempting to obtain EPA approval of their Title 
V operating permit program by including Minor New Source Review (NSR) (e.g., 
permits by rule) in the operating permit program. The TNRCC idea is that you 
would make changes or install equipment under a permit by rule as you do now 
under current rules. When your Title V permit is renewed, all Minor NSR 
approvals would be rolled into the permit and included in the renewed permit. 
They are also putting together a General Operating Permit (GOP) that would 
include Minor NSR. It is unknown if EPA will buy this concept.

Upset and Maintenance - A general note: The TNRCC field offices are giving 
different answers to questions that have been asked by industry about the new 
upset and maintenance rules. 

When reporting upset emissions, TNRCC wants you to report all pollutants, not 
just the ones that exceeded the RQs;
It is important to give as much detail as possible on the cause of an upset. 
"Operator error" is not acceptable to TNRCC and may make it more likely you 
will be investigated by TNRCC if you repeatedly give this as a cause since it 
may appear to the agency that this is a repeat problem that a company is not 
correcting;
TNRCC's Region 12 (Houston Area) is conducting inspections at 20 facilities 
specifically directed at upset notifications. The inspections take about two 
days. Companies are inspected if they make too many upset notifications or 
too few.
When reporting a release of natural gas (unspeciated), you should exclude 
methane and ethane from the reporting and calculation of determining the 
5,000 pound threshold, but according to TNRCC you cannot exclude CO2 or N2;
If you do speciate a release, remember that heptane and nonane are not listed 
pollutants so they default to a 100 pound RQ.

New Source Review - TNRCC has lifted their hold on NSR permits in the Houston 
non-attainment area, but if there are too many permit applications between 
now and December 6 (to beat the new non-attainment regulations that should 
pass on December 6) there is a chance that they will put another hold on 
permits.

EPA Enforcement Priorities - EPA has proposed their enforcement priorities 
for Fiscal Year 2002-3 and they include "fuels management". Fuels management 
is broadly defined to include many industries and includes pipelines. It is 
not believed that this directive is aimed at gas pipelines, but it is broad 
enough to include them.

Larry:

Ruth indicated you are having problems with EPA Region 6. Attached is a file 
with two EPA letters 
that include the statements:

     "granted a waiver
     from the fuel nitrogen monitoring requirement as natural
     gas fuel has been determined to contain no fuel bound
     nitrogen and having free nitrogen which does not contribute
     appreciably to the formation of NOx emissions"

and


 "EPA has already determined that nitrogen monitoring
     can be waived for pipeline-quality natural gas since there
     is no fuel bound nitrogen and the free nitrogen does not
     contribute appreciably to NOx emissions."


I also have an EPA contact in Research Triangle Park that is quite familiar 
with turbine NSPS regs.

Give me a call if you need more help.

Marc

Attached is the approved invoice management procedure for REMEDIATION 
projects associated with EPSC operations (EOTT assets).  The procedure was 
developed to streamline the insurance recovery process.  If you have any 
questions please give me a call.  Also, please forward this to any 
individuals that may need access to the procedure.

Subject: Environmental Notice

Attached for your review are the technical version and summary version of 
Environmental Notices on the revised Texas upset and maintenance reporting 
rules. The rules were passed this summer so this is a bit late getting out, 
but as you know I was in Puerto Rico at the time.

I am still trying to get clarification from TNRCC on their basis for 
requiring you to include Nitrogen and CO2 when determining the Reporting 
Quantity (RQ) for natural gas. I don't believe this is a very important issue 
at most locations but I am not sure TNRCC is correct on this issue. Your 
thoughts on this are welcome.

If you could provide comments by November 29 it would be appreciated. Since I 
am not up on all the ETS organizational changes, help with the distribution 
list would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Marc
