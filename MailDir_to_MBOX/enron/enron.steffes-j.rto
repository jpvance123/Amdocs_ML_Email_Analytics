25 October 2001

To: John Schelk, Enron

From: Enron Community Forum

Request (25 October):

1. The Barton discussion draft says that FERC's hands would be tied and that
they would have to approve a proposed RTO, as to size and scope, if the
proposed RTO owns or has operational control over transmission facilities
that serve at least 40,000 MW of load. Southern's CEO testified in Congress
recently that their load is over 35,000.  I assume the 40,000 MW minimum
would permit the SeTrans proposal to meet the proposed statutory minimum
since it is Southern plus a few munis, as I understand it.  Is this correct?

2. Who would know how many RTOs there would be if each were
just over the 40,000 MW minimum?

Response:

The load served by the transmission facilities in the proposed SeTrans
exceeds 40,000 Mw on a peak basis.  Specifically, the peak loads in Mw
recorded for 2000 by the members of SeTrans are:

Southern Co.		 31,702
Ala. Electric Coop.	   1,756
Ga. Trans. Corp              7,052
MEAG			   1,300 (est.)
City of Dalton                   NA
City of Tallahassee           550
South Mississippi           1,206 (2001 est.)
Jacksonville EA             2,614
Santee Cooper                3,600

Total			 50,230

2. Other conceivable RTOs above the 40,000 Mw threshold: 13.

Based on existing control areas or regional markets, and coincidence of
across those areas, a rough grouping of smaller RTOs can be envisioned with
transmission facilities capable of serving load in the range specified in
Rep. Barton's draft.  Peak load was used as a proxy for capacity of
transmission facilities. Intellbridge projects that based on the Barton
draft, a total of 14 RTOs - SeTrans and 13 others -- could be created.

However, the creation of hypothetical RTOs serving 40,000 Mw of load may
result in artificial groupings that would not be validated by commercial
arrangements. Existing transmission interties and supply contracts
necessitate the recognition of a new set of likely RTOs that are based in
part on current arrangements. Groupings with loads of between 40,000 Mw and
50,000 Mw seemed more likely to result.

 It also appears highly unlikely that the PJM Interconnect, now with a load
exceeding 50,000, would be subject to change. Two utilities in Pennsylvania
tied to but not part of PJM were added to form a Mid-Atlantic RTO.

Based on existing control areas or regional markets, and coincidence of
across those areas, a rough grouping of smaller RTOs can be envisioned with
transmission facilities capable of serving load in the range specified in
Rep. Barton's draft.  Peak load was used as a proxy for capacity of
transmission facilities.

Northeast Power Coordinating Council
ISO New England and NYISO, the U.S. Control Areas within the Northeast Power
Coordinating Council (NPCC), had a coincident summer peak of just fewer than
50,000.  ISO New England itself peaked at 21,919 MW, and NYISO at 28,138 MW.


Florida Reliability Coordinating Council
The FRCC's all time summer peak was 38,730 Mw, near the 40,000 Mw threshold.
Power is frequently exported north from the state when peaks in the Southern
Co. control area are not coincident with those in Florida.  NERC forecast
FRCC's 2001 summer internal peak demand to be 38,478 Mw.

Southwest Power Pool
The Southwest Power Pool (SPP), which had at one point discussed the
possibility of forming its own RTO rather than merging with Midwest ISO,
fits neatly into the 40,000 MW range specified in Rep. Barton's draft.  SPP
experienced peak demand of 40,101 MW during summer 2000.

Western States: Three RTOs
The Western Systems Coordinating Council reported peak demand for 2000 of
130,892 MW.  Three smaller RTOs could likely be carved out of the WSCC.

	*	Northwest Power Pool (NWPP): Net internal demand for the
Northwest Power Pool reported an annual peak of 57,107 MW during winter
2000-2001.  Without Canadian demand (with a winter peak of roughly 17,607
MW) the Northwest Power Pool would fall near the 40,000 MW threshold
specified by Barton's draft.

	*	California: The California system experienced a year 2000
peak demand of 51,213 MW during the summer.  Subtracting Mexican demand puts
the figure at just under 50,000 MW.

	*	Arizona, New Mexico, Southern Nevada (AZ/NM/SNV) and Rocky
Mountain Power Area (RMPA): The remaining reliability areas would not, on
their own, meet Barton's 40,000 MW threshold.  AZNM-SNV served only 21,724
MW at its summer 2000 peak, and RMPA, which can vacillates between having a
winter and summer peak, served 7,640 MW during summer 2000.  According to
the WSCC forecasts, the two regions could see a peak demand near 40,000 by
2010.

An alternative (though less likely) configuration could involve a
combination of Southern California with AZNM-SNV and RMPA, leaving Northern
California with NWPP.

Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP) and Mid-American Interconnected Network
(MAIN): Separate RTOs, Few Changes
In the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP), U.S. systems had a year 2000
summer peak of 26,308 MW.  Load from Canadian systems brings the peak up to
just over 30,000 MW.

The Mid-American Interconnected Network (MAIN) experienced a summer 2000
peak demand of 52,214 MW, which would put it above the 40,000 threshold.
Shifting Wisconsin's MAIN members -- Wisconsin Electric Power, Wisconsin
Public Power and Wisconsin Public Service --  into the MAPP area reduces put
peak load for both MAPP and MAIN to close to the Barton bill's 40,000 Mw
mark.  Those three utilities had a 1999 coincident peak of roughly 8500 Mw.

Southeast and Northeast Central States: Five RTOs
The degree which to the transmission system is tied together east of the
Mississippi River necessitates approximately five groupings for RTOs in
addition to the NPCC. These can best be described as the Virginia-Carolina
area (now known as the NERC subregion VACAR), the Mid-Atlantic region (now
PJM), a Tennessee-Kentucky RTO (the TVA area is now a NERC subregion) and
two groupings for the East Central Area Reliability Council, North ECAR and
Central ECAR.

To illustrate how complex it is to redraw boundaries when systems are
physically connected, the approximate load in Mw by utility of these
fictional groupings is listed below.  Other considerations may play a larger
role in the creation of RTOs.

I am drafting a paper on balanced schedules. 

I saw this presentation in the Website. It looks like Enron, but our logo is not there

Material is good. I am thinking about borrowing some examples .


Does this attached presentation look familiar to you?

RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussed congestion management.  The panelists were:  Na=
ncy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; C=
arol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkl=
ey and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Gro=
up.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system is not going to change =
in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Opening Statements

Nancy Brockway:  focus on two topics:  1) flowgate vs. LMP; and 2) relation=
ship between congestion management (CM) and resource planning.  She support=
s LMP and standard market design in New England.  Flowgate rights are cumbe=
rsome, create unnecessary uplift costs - freezing power distribution factor=
s is bad and could result in some free rides.  She is a Hogan follower, and=
 Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult.  With regard to th=
e relationship between CM and resource planning, transmission is a monopoly=
, and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision - decide where=
 to site generation or transmission and take a risk.  FERC should not overr=
ide that principle.  Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut cong=
estion management.

Reem Fahey:  RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator.  Ca=
nnot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion.  CM should have=
 a bid-based structure with LMP.  Design of CM should allow flexibility for=
 market participants to be in the spot and forward markets.  Transmission r=
ights - must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hed=
ging in real time.  FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs a=
nd market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load. =
 These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system.

Carol Guthrie:  Her company has diverse interests in electricity market - o=
ver 4,000 service locations, over 150 suppliers, more than 15 sites where t=
hey have industrial generation serving own load (500 MW). =20

Shmuel Oren:  Advocates minimal ISOs, direct assignment of congestion costs=
 in real time, flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralize=
d coordination and supports forward rights.  Does not support "one size fit=
s all."  Need to understand gaming, modes of market failure.  Problems in T=
exas - people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve t=
he congestion.  Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable.

Andy Ott:  There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works=
.  It's an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during c=
onstraints.  PJM has been using nodal pricing since 1998.  Utilities have r=
un their system on this approach for years - economic dispatch to meet dema=
nd.  Cannot do balancing and CM separately -- does not work.  Transmission =
rights must be financial.  Spot market is physical.  Financial model is the=
 hedging.  You need this separation because it allows players to do bilater=
als or buy or sell from the spot market.  Also allows FTRs to be traded and=
 used to protect from congestion. =20

Michael Schnitzer:  There is a preferred method of CM - the LMP based CM sy=
stem with financial rights.  DAM and RT bid-based security constrained loca=
tional pricing markets.  Bilateral transactions are allowed.  Transmission =
rights must be financial, not physical.  Allows transmission users to hedge=
 congestion costs.  Why is CM so important?  Need to get the prices right t=
o give the right signals to the market.  Three goals:  1) get dispatch righ=
t - show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can re=
spond accordingly; 2) price signals to generation for location purposes - c=
larifies responsibility and risk allocations; 3) market signals for when to=
 expand the grid - LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FT=
Rs.

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  The panelists=
 agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tr=
adable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or=
 flowgates are actually more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable;=
 Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

 Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

 Let me know if you have any questions.

Cinergy has just emailed today a proposed settlement which has to be filed by Friday - a very short window of time.  I will be reviewing it in the next hour so I can't yet give you a summary.  
Please review and let me know your thoughts.

Jeff, This doc. is drafted by Cinergy.  I am wondering whether we can leverage our signature - assuming we are basically ok with the doc. to a commitment to talk about the imbalance issues.  I don't think we have leverage to force a conclusion on the imbalance issue unless I can get other parties on board.  Facing a friday deadline, we will have to move fast.

Subject:	Indiana Midwest ISO Joint Petitioners - IURC Cause Nos. 42027 and 42032 - Proposed Settlement Agreement

Attached below is my draft of a proposed Settlement Agreement prepared
on behalf of the Midwest ISO Joint Petitioners in the consolidated
proceeding on IURC Cause Nos. 42027 and 42032.

My draft also reflects the comments of IMPA and the Midwest ISO.

I have not and will not circulate my draft to NIPSCO or I&M.  Since they
will not be a party to the Settlement Agreement, I do not believe that
they need to see my draft.

To facilitate execution (if we reach agreement), I have included 10
separate entity specific signature pages.

Under my draft, the Midwest ISO Joint Petitioners would request IURC
permission to withdraw their participation in the Joint Motion To Strike
Prefiled Testimony Of Intervenor Enron.

My draft attempts to include all of the commitments made in prefiled
testimony by the Midwest ISO Joint Petitioners and all of the
representations made to the IURC in prefiled testimony by Mr. James P.
Torgerson on behalf of the Midwest ISO.

It is my understanding from the IURC's recent Docket Entry that any
settlement agreement should be filed with the IURC by Friday, November
9.

Please let me know when you would like to meet in person or by
conference call to discuss my draft proposed Settlement Agreement.

Jim, i suggest that the group includes Exelon (Jack Crowley), Constellation (Harvey Reed), Edison Mission Energy (Reem Fahey), Reliant (John Orr), Duke (Mike Gildea or Lee Barrett), Mirant (Jim Mayhew), PG&E (Richard Doying) and Cinergy (Dennis Flaherty).  Some of these parties may not be supportive but would appreciate being contacted (which at least opens up the communications channel for NG).  

I suggest that NG make contact with the executives rather than Enron (we need to continue to hedge our position, the old no fingerprints approach)...

Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues from both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

All commissioners were present.  Shelton Cannon was the moderator and facilitator.  Purpose is to have intensive discussion to develop FERC guidance.  Focus is on functions rather than characteristics - what should and should not be standardized?

 Midwest Commissioners' Presentation

Several Midwest commissioners were invited to make an opening statement.  David Svanda, Michigan PSC, made the comments.  He said Midwest state regulators believe there are arbitrary boundaries between ARTO and MISO.  State regulators worked hard on the settlement that includes single rate and IRCA.  MISO and ARTO have not resolved critical issues and now there needs significant bolstering of the IRAC effort.  Would like to work with FERC on details of Midwest issues.  They propose to create a Joint Board between FERC and State Regulators, pursuant to section 209 of the FPA, to formalize a FERC/midwest partnership.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Although this was an issue to be discussed by the second panel, the issue was raised in the first panel when the discussion centered on ancillary services.  Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

Standardized Markets

Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Breathitt asked whether there could be an entirely bilateral market with no mandatory balancing market.  All of the panelists agreed that you must have a real time energy market even with bilateral contracts.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet, the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

ICAP

Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Brownell said she thinks the ICAP debate is one that needs to be resolved now, before RTOs are put in place.  She wonders whether ICAP requirements are needed in the interim until RTOs, with working markets, are up and running.  Not many of the panelists agreed with this, saying temporary ICAP requirements will not send the needed signals to build.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?

Steve Naumann said he assumes two Midwest RTOs, but most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Midwest Commissioners' Proposal to Have a Joint Board

Massey asked all the panelists what they thought of this idea.  None of the panelists, even the Connecticut commissioner, thought this was a good idea, citing the inevitable disagreements and problems that will arise, and the risk that such a Board could slow down progress.

 

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

Participants:

-Prof. Charles Cicchetti, Univ. of Southern California
-Comm. Robert Nelson, Mich. Pub. Serv. Comm.
-Marji Phillips, Exelon Power Team (attorney)
-Sonny Popowski, PA Office of Consumer Advocate
-Craig Roach, Boston Pacific
-Anjali Sheffrin, Dir. Market Analysis, Cal ISO

Summary:  Market Monitor (MM) should be independent.  Too much MM transparency is a problem -- MM function should be done privately to FERC.  MM should be an early warning signal.

Specifics:
The morning started on a rather humorous note with Marji Phillips introducing herself as "the guilty party so to speak in front of you" (referencing the PECO/Exelon purported violation of standards of conduct).  She stated that it is not the role of the MM to interfere to make sure that power prices are the lowest in each hour -- the MM should monitor the RTO and the markets and be part of a creative solution (without imposing its own MM penalties/mitigation).  She used the Midwest price spikes of 98 as an example, and stated that a poor MM would probably have worsened the market solution that was reached without intervention.

Most of the group agreed with Prof. Cicchetti that the MM should not be the policeman, judge and jury.  He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).  As Craig Roach said, the MM should look at more than market power -- it should also look at market conditions and market rules and be a vehicle for innovation.  Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not "go to the farmer for costs."  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.  

Many thought that there should be some standardization of the information provided to the MM.  Most agreed that the information should be provided on a confidential basis, especially before any specific problem has been found.

Sonny Popowski stated that the RTO must be truly independent or the MM simply catalogs the market failures.

Comm. Nelson said that the MM should have unfettered access to all costs and should have the ability for "cease and desist" orders.  Also, stated that ITCs/transcos should be monitored to the extent that they favor transmission solutions over DG and generation.  On the very positive side, he said RTO policy should proceed.

Ms. Sheffrin said that it would be simple to implement a rolling 12 month cost plus 10% competitive benchmark, and prices above this should be mitigated.  She said this would allow bidders to "self police" so as to not hit the benchmark.  Most of the others disagreed with her, pointing out that a simplistic test such as this does not account for market conditions.  It was pointed out that there were too many different MMs in Cal with no one acting.  Someone also commented that one reason participants did not want to turn data over to Cal ISO was because it was a contesting party.

All thought that DSM should be included in the market in order to be considered in mitigation.

Comm. Breathitt asked Ms. Sheffrin why the price cap wouldn't work in Cal.  She responded that the problems in Cal were with the need for LT contracts and other issues (she also said that it is not a zonal/lmp issue).  Importantly, she said that consumers are now conserving 3000-5000 MWs annually since getting the appropriate price signals.  Mr. Popowski said that he likes the price caps in PJM.  Margie countered and said that "icap" in PJM is the problem.  

FERC staff asked if the MM should monitor bilaterals.  Marji said absolutely not (between consenting companies and should not be unraveled).  Both agreed that the MM may at times need access to these in order to understand what was happening in the spot market.

FYI, I haven't reviewed yet.  Also, I told Andrea to not do anything on this.  We can decide how we want to use it.

Subject:	Southeast RTO draft affidavit


Hi Christi,

Here's the draft of the affidavit, which I have sent to Andrea Settanni as
well, to review.  The analysis has two sections 1) historical trading data
in the southeast, and 2)a power flow analysis of 61 different transactions
to examine parallel flows.  We found that for all types of transactions
there are extensive parallel flows throughout the southeast (Grid South,
Southern Company, Grid Florida, and Entergy), including TVA and SPP as well.
SPP seems to be as tightly tied to MAPP as to Entergy and SoCo, so could go
either way (i.e. with the Southeast or with the Midwest).

In addition to significant parallel flows throughout, my analysis of the
trade data showed quite a bit of marketer activity (both marketers such as
Enron and Coral... and also marketing affiliates of transmission providers).
To me this says that a large RTO is required because marketers are clearly
important participants in the electricity markets in the southeast, and they
do not confine themselves to small areas. The regions will need consistent
trading and market rules if strong competitive markets are to develop and
continue to allow the expansion of trade.

This draft should become a final version once Andrea has had a chance to
check the content and format.  Please let me know if this affidavit
addresses your questions, or if you want to have any additional questions
analyzed.

Thank you,
Judy

 RTO Week

Day 3 -- October 17, 2001

Standardizing RTO Tariffs

The morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  

The panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.

General Observations

This panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an "as available" basis.   The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.

I am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.

What Services Should be Standardized?

Overall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  

XCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  

Should FERC Retain CBM?

Ricky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.

Network Versus Point to Point Service

Peter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  

Should all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?

Most of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.

What Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?

Jim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize "as available" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.

Ray Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

While several weeks ago we discussed making the blanket protest to the numerous MISO filings and request for one RTO, the Commission has not granted our request.  Therefore, to the extent that some truly poor/bad items are proposed by MISO, I think we need to pop in with our same request for one RTO, review all filings together ....., but add a paragraph or two about the truly problematic item.

Since our real time power desk has expressed concern over MISO's proposed $1000 penalty on accepted transmission requests that are not confirmed by the customer, we should file a brief protest.  DUE MONDAY NOV. 5

Here it is for your comments by late morning Monday.  Thanks.

Jim

As per your request, I examined the attached doc (Response of National Grid=
 US to Questions posed by the comission)

My initial reaction is:

1) The simple answer to your question is: yes, I think the proposed governa=
nce and organization structure can live with an LMP model. I am not familia=
r with other MISO CM model, but at least in terms of LMP, my feeling is tha=
t those are not mutually exclusive. It may be worth asking Ashley Brown

2) National Grid and other proponents of For-Profit-Transcos may have other=
 ideas on how to manage congestions (e.g. different reliability level produ=
cts by customer segment). However, the attached paper makes no allusion to =
avoid LMP and to introduce other congestion management models. The paper do=
es not imply a physical model either. Your feeling may be right, but it doe=
s not surface from the paper per se.

3) National Grid proposal is, in fact, an expanded version of the Southeast=
 Model proposed at the Mediation. It reinforces the role of the Transco Com=
pany, preempting, to some extent, the role of the System Admininstrator. Th=
is was a very controversial topic in the mediation: the System Adminstrator=
 was in charge of some functions to avoid potential bias.  (particularly fr=
om transmission companies who are not willing/able to transfer their T asse=
ts)

4) National Grid will face a lot of resistance when selling this idea; Your=
 concerns on generation redispatch and long term transmission planning are =
"surfaced" in the paper, by creating a concept of "core vs. additional" fun=
ctions and a chinese wall, if necessary.  But the perception of potential b=
ias does exist. National Grid will probably face a lot of difficulty in " s=
elling"  this idea. Particularly when we get to the details

FYI.  If we were to ask NG, could they live with the MISO CM/market model??

NG proposal for "splitting" work between Transco and other parties.  Don't =

As I read this document, I get the strange feeling that NG is a physical-ri=

they can control (a) TTC/ATC and (b) use of non-firm transmission. =20

While the NG letter states that the "functions related to energy markets ca=

 a Core Function the "Ability to propose congestion pricing methodology".  =
Sure APX could go in and operate the balancing and CM system, but NG has th=
e right to design subject to FERC procedures.

Not sure what you guys think? =20

I will probably get back to Ashley Brown later this week.

As you've noted, already approved RTO's are not of an optimally efficient size...Barton's draft is a thinly veiled retrenchment primarily aimed at protecting Southern. The worst part about this is that it ties FERC's hands...they can't do their jobs.....no ability to apply their expertise. Has Barton done a cost-benefit analysis to support 40,000 MW limit? to support current RTO sizes and configurations?

Subject:	RTO Legal Question



I am working on an analysis of the details of the Barton draft RTO language.  While it is highly objectionable and our goal is to kill it, to do so we need to respond to requests to be specific about why we don't like it.  One of the more objectionable provisions says that FERC can't change the scope, governance, etc. of any RTO that has been "approved" under Order 2000 prior to enactment of the legislation.

If this applies to PJM, the legislation would stop the Northeast-wide RTO in its tracks since several of you and PJM's Phil Harris testified last week that FERC has "approved" PJM.  By contrast, committee staff and the section-by-section they distributed on the RTO legislative proposal say that to date FERC has NOT approved any RTOs under Order 2000.  They say that the legislative language would not apply to any RTO as of this date because FERC approvals of PJM, Cal ISO and NePool have been approved under the "ISO principles" of Order 888.

Your thoughts on the above would be helpful. Either way, I think we can argue that the provision shows why the Barton proposal is a retrenchment rather than an advancement on RTOs.  If it does not apply to PJM and the others as they contend, there is no good reason to include it other than to "freeze" the process at FERC merely by having the legislation pending on the Hill, much less enacted into law.

Comments on FERC's RTO Week are due on November 3 (Saturday) so we would like to submit comments by the end of this week.  Some of us have briefly discussed the types of comments we may want to submit on behalf of Enron, and the attached list of "Talking Points" are issues that Christi and I put together for Rick during his Washington meetings last week.  These talking points focus on issues that were raised during RTO Week by panelists that we may want to address -- either because the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  We will use the talking points as an outline on issues to raise in our comments.  

We also want to state up front in the comments that FERC is on the right track and that FERC has done a lot of analysis and studies to determine that "right sized" RTOs are in the public interest (this is in response to the negative comments made by the state commissioners that FERC is taking action that has not been proven to be beneficial to consumers).  We also want to make the point that RTO creation is not about retail access and does not impact whether or not a state offers retail choice.

Also attached is a link to FERC Staff's notes from RTO Week.  I have not reviewed these notes yet, but we may also want to respond to these notes in our comments using the same criteria as above; i.e., on areas where we feel that the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  

Please review the Talking Points paper and the Staff Notes, and let me know what you think about this strategy.  I am writing the comments and welcome all help and input.  

I hope to keep these comments limited (10 pages or so), so we need to stay focused -- raise the issue, make our point, and move on.  

Thanks Everyone

Sarah

All:

After I sent out the draft late yesterday afternoon, I found out that FERC
had extended the deadline from November 5 to "as soon as reasonably
possible."  Obviously, we would like to provide everyone with sufficient
time to review the draft and get approvals.  We also have a saying in
Chicago - "Vote early and often" and at least with respect to the "vote
early" we think it is important to get comments in early.

Therefore we now suggest that instead of replying by the end of today as to
whether you can sign or not sign and what must be added or deleted for you
to join, we suggest responding by the end of Friday.  This will allow us to
circulate another draft and get comments in by the middle of next week and
have considerable influence on the process.

Thanks for your help under these changing circumstances.

Following up on last night's e-mail, here are some specific suggestions to strengthen the draft EPSA letter on the Barton RTO draft.

The second paragraph and the first few bullets after it should be rewritten as follows to make it clear that the current legislative proposal on RTOs is far off the mark as opposed to being fixed by "technical corrections" as the draft letter now states:

You have identified RTOs as critical to the development of a well-functioning transmission system, and we wholeheartedly agree.  We commend you for including all transmission-owning utilities in the RTO provisions and for requiring that transmission be conducted on an open-access basis.  However, to accomplish the RTO and transmission goals we share, it is essential that any legislation on RTOs not slow down the process already underway at FERC.  Unfortunately, the discussion draft as issued on October 9th does not meet this test.  Specifically, the proposal

Establishes a lengthy and cumbersome process that will delay the formation of RTOs by imposing procedural requirements that advantage those who oppose properly functioning RTOs, including evidentiary hearings and court appeals review under standards of judicial review not normally applicable to Federal Power Act cases.  

Removes the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to deal with an evolving marketplace by statutorily freezing market and operational structures in place as of date of enactment regardless of changed circumstances.

[rest of the bullets as in the draft letter]

We appreciate the opportunity to offer these suggestions to strengthen the draft letter.  Please call with any questions or comments before the Legislative Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow.  Thanks.

John

Attached is a notice issued by FERC today extending the date for comments on RTO Week.  I think FERC is extending the deadline so that parties have time to review FERC Staff's notes (circulated yesterday) and comment on those notes.  FERC has not set a new date for comments but asks that they be submitted as soon as possible.

In that regard, it would help me in preparing our comments if each of you would read FERC's notes on RTO Week and provide me with your thoughts on those notes.  The comments are relatively detailed, and we should comment on issues raised in their notes that we feel need clarifying or highlighting.  We still want to make the arguments that it has already been proven that Right Sized RTOs are beneficial and that RTOs will not force states into retail access, but when we address specific issues, we should do so in response to FERC Staff's notes.

Let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to your comments and thoughts on Staff's Notes.

Thanks

Sarah

 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

 The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists =
were:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison M=
ission; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of Californi=
a - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthB=
ridge Group.

 General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

I am working on an analysis of the details of the Barton draft RTO language.  While it is highly objectionable and our goal is to kill it, to do so we need to respond to requests to be specific about why we don't like it.  One of the more objectionable provisions says that FERC can't change the scope, governance, etc. of any RTO that has been "approved" under Order 2000 prior to enactment of the legislation.

If this applies to PJM, the legislation would stop the Northeast-wide RTO in its tracks since several of you and PJM's Phil Harris testified last week that FERC has "approved" PJM.  By contrast, committee staff and the section-by-section they distributed on the RTO legislative proposal say that to date FERC has NOT approved any RTOs under Order 2000.  They say that the legislative language would not apply to any RTO as of this date because FERC approvals of PJM, Cal ISO and NePool have been approved under the "ISO principles" of Order 888.

Your thoughts on the above would be helpful. Either way, I think we can argue that the provision shows why the Barton proposal is a retrenchment rather than an advancement on RTOs.  If it does not apply to PJM and the others as they contend, there is no good reason to include it other than to "freeze" the process at FERC merely by having the legislation pending on the Hill, much less enacted into law.

Mirant has nine gens/mkters signed on to doing a MW cost-benefit study.  They have estimated a total cost of the study to be $75,000 - 100,000 and will use the same consulting firm, EEA, that was used for the NE study. Each of the companies would pay maximum $7500-10,000. 

Mirant made its presentation last week at FERC and I attended.  Overall, I thought the study would be useful to FERC in supporting their decision for one NE (and also one MW) study.  The presentation at FERC was headed up by a regulatory person at Mirant rather than the consultant and of course there were some skeptics in the public forum.  Some of the questions raised may have been better answered by the consultants or by someone with more NE trading experience.  However, upon review of the EEA affidavit for the "One RTO Coalition", I think this study would be a benefit to FERC on the MW decisions to be made.

If you agree that supporting this proposed study is a good idea, let me know and I will submit an RCR and follow up with Mirant.

Subject: Mirant Proposed Study of the Midwest--Companies interested in
sponsoring the study. 


As I had mentioned to the Coalition last week,  Mirant is proceeding with
preparing a study evaluating the RTO and Market inefficiencies in the
Midwest. This study is a followon to the study that was sponsored by Mirant
for the Northeast.


I have received indications from the following Companies that they have an
interest in sponsoring the study with Mirant.   

Mirant;   AES; Constellation;  DENA; Edison Mission; Calpine; Reliant; NRG
Energy, PSEG; NEG/PGE; 


For those companies that I have not listed,  please let me know if your
company has an interest in the study sponsorship.   We are now attempting to
schedule a meeting in Washington next week to review proposed scope,
sponsorship, utilization and other issues related to the study.

 10  October, 2001
To: James D. Steffes,  Enron
From: Enron  Forum
Content: Intellibridge has compiled the following report  in response to your request.
Request:
What  would be the amount of installed capacity of each of the FERC RTOs (assuming  Californiais ultimately in the  Western RTO) and what is the total peak demand in each  area?
 
Response:
 
Intellibridge estimates the following peak demand and installed capacity  figures for each of the four proposed FERC RTO regions based on the most recent  complete data available.  Peak load  data sets that were deemed complete and reliable are for 1999. Installed  capacity information is from forecasts made by NERC for 2001.
 
[IMAGE]
 
 In response to FERC  Order 2000 of 6 January  2000, utilities throughout  the United  Statessubmitted proposals to  form Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) for coordinating and controlling  electric power grid systems in their area.   FERC responded to these proposals on 12 July 2001, in a series of orders  that made clear the Commission's vision of four large, regional RTOs making up  U.S. bulk power markets.  FERC said  in these orders, "We favor the development of one RTO for the Northeast, one RTO  for the Midwest, one RTO for the Southeast, and one RTO for the  West."
 
Though the eventual shape and scope of the regional RTOs remains in  question, estimates of capacity and peak demand can be made based on groupings  of North American Electricity Reliability Council (NERC) regional councils or  regional ISOs and bulk power markets.   For the purposes of estimating installed capacity and peak load in these  regions, the following groupings of NERC regional councils and ISOs were assumed  to correspond to the four RTOs proposed by  FERC:
 
Northeast:
?         PJM
?         ISO-New England
?         New York ISO
 
Southeast:
?         Southeastern Electric Reliability Council  (SERC)
?         Florida Reliability Coordinating Council  (FRCC)
 
Midwest:
?         Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP)
?         Mid-American Interconnected Network, Inc.  (MAIN)
?         Southwest Power Pool (SPP)
?         Eastern Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement  (ECAR)
 
West
?         Western Systems Coordinating Council  (WSCC)
 
Peak Load  Data:
FERC  Form 714 hourly load data were used to calculate coincidental peak load for the  Midwest and Southeast RTOs.  FERC's  most recent, complete set of Form 714 data are for year 1999; FERC is still  collecting data for year 2000.  Year  1999 data were consequently used throughout for the sake of consistency.  Peak demand for the Western RTO was  taken as the 1999 annual peak reported by NERC for the WSCC in its year 2000  "Summer Assessment".  Coincidental  peak demand for the Northeastern RTO was calculated from 1999 hourly load data  available on the PJM, ISO-New England, and New York ISO web sites.
 
Installed  Capacity Data:
NERC  Electricity Supply & Demand for 2001. While some sets of this data for 2001  are estimates, it can be assumed that the Summer 2001 installed capacity data is  reasonably current. Other estimates can be made available.
