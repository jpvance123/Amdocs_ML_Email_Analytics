Subject:=09White House To Support FERC Action Today

According to this morning's Washington Post, the Bush Administration will s=
upport the expected FERC action today of extending the existing California =
price mitigation regime to 10 other Western states and to all days/all hour=
s, not just during California emergencies (stages 1, 2 and 3).  This action=
 comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will  testify on the Fein=
stein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee, Gov. =
Davis and FERC will  testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committ=
ee on Wednesday, and the House Financial Services Committee joins the fray =
with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday.  The latter=
 committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of energy p=
olicy on a number of factors, including its jurisdiction over presidential =
economic emergency powers.  The committee staff has in the past expressed i=
nterest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy trading and ma=
rkets.  We are checking now to quietly determine whether these issues will =
be on Wednesday's agenda.

Traders et al:

This is the best article I saw on what the FERC may do on Monday.

We are hopeful (and doing lobbying to push for) for no action outside of California, given the unworkability and meaningless-ness of price controls outside of CA.  This is an effort and not a promise, of course.

Some action in CA seems more than 50-50 likely  and the best bet seem to be extending the current proxy mitigation to all hours.  The article below raises the possibility of reissuing the refund orders (recall that they began in March 01 for the month of January 01) to cover all hours and not just during Stage 3.  Such reissued refund order could extend back to Oct 00.

Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits
 Utilities: Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergencies and throughout the West.


By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer

     WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday.
     Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West.
     According to several commission officials, the options being discussed include:
     * Extending FERC's current price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The limits, intended to prevent price spikes, were invoked during two emergencies last month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity. FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West.
     * Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.
     * Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity.
     * Tightening rules on what energy marketers--firms that buy and resell power contracts much like stockbrokers trade shares--can charge for their electricity.
     * Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies.
     The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being sought by Gov. Gray Davis and California Democrats. But they may go far enough to provide an acceptable compromise.
     "The whole thing is in flux, but it is moving toward a much more effective price mitigation plan, not only for California but for the West," said an agency official.
     Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role. "We're sort of the last to get it," the official said.
     FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California. FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. has responded by citing dozens of modest FERC actions to assist the state.
     But Hebert has resisted Davis' central demand that FERC use its legal authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates. Such fixed rates, based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit, were standard before deregulation.
     "The politics of the situation have changed significantly, and commissioners are not immune to politics," said another senior agency official. "The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a Democratic Senate. Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure there is no price gouging."
     FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) a week from today. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the new Senate Energy Committee chairman, has told FERC he will move legislation to cap electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon.
     Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next week empty-handed.
     House Republicans have also been prodding the agency. On Tuesday, Energy Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote Hebert to urge Western-wide, round-the-clock price limits.
     "We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy . . . within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council," wrote Tauzin, referring to the Western power grid.
     FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus on the five-member commission, lately riven by ideology but now bolstered by two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry.
     Commissioner William Massey, who for months has been a lonely dissenter, is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis, officials said. Once marginalized, Massey apparently is now being actively wooed by the other members.
     S. David Freeman, an energy advisor to Gov. Davis, said Tuesday that expanding FERC's current price limits would be a positive step. But he added that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional, fixed rates.
     "Any strengthening of the [FERC] plan is in the public interest," Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference.
     FERC's price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but are flexible.
     When a power emergency is called by the state, FERC's plan limits the price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the least efficient plant running at that time. (The costs of all the plants are determined beforehand by California's grid operator based on data filed by the generators.)
     Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency conditions.
     When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month, prices came down quickly. But power sellers complained that the limits were too strict. And by the second emergency, there was evidence that some sellers had started finding ways around the limits.

Although a final order is not yet available, we were able to glean the basic content of the Commission's latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning.   It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations, which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC.  Highlights include:

In California, refunds/offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX, and only as of October 2.

Both public and non-public utilities are subject to refund.

It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order, as refined by Judge Wagner.

Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology.

A 10% creditworthiness premium will be added.

An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology;  it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days.

A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds.  It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days, followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days.  The Judge would then have an additional 7 days to report to the Commission.  An issue will be the definition of "spot" transaction for the Pac NW, since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California.


We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues.

The FERC meeting is still going on but it is my understanding the FERC has:

issued an order addressing governance of the CAISO (and reported in the press) was held.

 set the California refund case to hearings and has modified the competitive benchmark formula recommended by Judge Wagner.  When we know what the changes are, we will inform you.  The Commission said muni's are subject to refunds just like investor-owned utilities.

opened a proceeding on to accept requests for and consider refunds in the rest of the West. (!)

More to come ...

On June 13th the Commission issued an Order Denying Rehearing of its April 6th Order on creditworthiness requirements for the CAISO.  The Commission rejected requests by the ISO, California Electricity Oversight Board (CEOB) and the California PUC to weaken the creditworthiness provisions as they apply to DWR, PG&E and SCE.  The order is attached. The FERC also denied the Attorney General's motion to intervene -- this is important because only intervenors can appeal the decision to the courts.

"Spot" Traders:

Sarah Novosel, Ray Alvarez (both from the D.C. office) and I talked to Michael Goldenberg, a FERC staff attorney in the General Counsel's Office. He does not speak for the FERC but hearing his views on the order is helpful nonetheless. Here's a brief recap (paraphrased) of what we learned.

Q.  If the  cap falls between the time a deal is confirmed and the delivery hour, is the supplier liable for the difference?

A.     This is a legitimate question and will only be fully answered by making a formal motion for clarification from the FERC. [Michael mentioned that perhaps CAISO could resolve this but this issue really applies to  markets outside of CAISO, so it is unlikely CAISO can resolve this.]  The order can probably be read two ways.  One interpretation is that the only cap that applies is the one in effect in the delivery hour, in which case the supplier  is liable for refund (or if a generator, a cost justification filing).  Another is that the cap that applies is the one in effect when the deal is negotiated.  Part of his reasoning for making the latter interpretation is that the order clearly wants to provide certainty to the market and part of the order allows prices to be "negotiated up to the maximum price," (p. 42) which could be read as allowing the cap to the be the one in effect at time of negotiation.

Michael indicated that the FERC  is not setting up any sort of formal compliance or monitoring, so, for markets subject to the cap (other than those operated by CAISO) it will be up to the buyer to complain that it was sold above-cap power.  [Thus reiterating that the risk of refund depends in part on the counter party to the deal.]

Q. Cash deals are normally traded the day before delivery.  However, some cash deals are traded more than 24-hours out.  Also, cash traders could intentionally start making deals farther out as a way to avoid the cap.  Are such cash deals exempt from cap or is that a "loop hole"?

A. The FERC order is very clear that the cap applies only to deals that are traded on the day of or day before the first delivery hour, so, the described deals are exempt and he does not consider it to be a "loop hole".  FERC could change the rules in the future, of course, but he reads the order as clear on this matter.

FERC rejected the request by PGE to modify the Code of Conduct so that they could buy on EnronOnline.  Basically, FERC did not believe that buying thru EnronOnline was a guarantee that consumers in Oregon would not be harmed.  

FERC found that There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline                                     
     represent prevailing market prices.
          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
     is willing to buy at.

FERC left open the idea that PGE could re-file to fix the affiliate abuse.

As soon as we hear anything else, I'll let you know.

     Portland General Electric Company         Docket No. ER01-2097-000

     Enron Power Marketing, Inc.                  Docket No. ER01-2103-000


ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE

                           (Issued July 20, 2001)

          In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed
     amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland
     General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate
     tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using
     the EnronOnline trading platform.

     I.   Background

          On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in
     Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000
     (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-
     based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through
     the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication
     among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on
     EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on
                 1
     EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing
     provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which
     allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the
     Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there
     are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to
     its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower
     than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous
     offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,
     established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their
     respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make

               1
                The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,
          an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-
          based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view
          real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly
          online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather
          EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in
          buying from and selling power to third parties.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-
          and ER01-2103-000

     inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions
     different than those in place but that, they state, will still
     prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's
     requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in
     electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's
     requirement that "PGE post on its website notice of a potential
     purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the
     transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since
     EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not
     provide for a waiting period before consummating the
                  2
     transaction."   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the
     ability to buy or sell power "from perhaps the largest marketer
                                                                3
     in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers."

     II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests

          Notices of the filings were published in the Federal
     Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),
     and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with
     motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before
     June 12, 2001.  None was filed.

     III. Discussion

          The Commission allows power marketers and their public
     utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates
     when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate
     abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can
     occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers
     sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at
     above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers
     (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the
     Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization
     by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate
                                                             4
     sales at an established, relevant market price or index.
     Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are
     transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various
     conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent
                     5
     affiliate abuse.

          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3-
          and ER01-2103-000


          Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to
     use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the
     following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient
     protection against affiliate abuse.  PGE, when buying from EPMI
     using EnronOnline, will be required to "take the transaction
     price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular
                                                              6
     location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment."   In
                                                                  7
     addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or
     engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity
     of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction
     being finalized.  Applicants also propose to amend their
     respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication
     regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.

          Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate
     abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at

          62,197-98 (1997) (Detroit Edison).  In GPU, the Commission
          allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional
          public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate
          the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard
          supplier agreements.  Accord, First Energy Trading & Power

          FERC   61,311 (1998).  Detroit Edison provided that a traditional
          public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer
          only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-
          affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its
          electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same
          rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the
          affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin
          board.  Accord, Jersey Central Power & Light Co., 82 FERC

                In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would
          know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or
          lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While
          Applicants do not define "Limit Order," the common understanding
          is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to
          transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in
          the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the
          order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit
          order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when
          the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which
          case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-
          and ER01-2103-000

     the posted price (a price that is offered to all market
     participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI
     knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is
     finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be
     unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,
     but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.
     Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by
     computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of
     PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted
     electronically and is available to all market participants,
     Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to
     transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and
     conditions that are available to PGE.

          Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed
     restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the
     Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,
     protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its
                                           8
     transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of
     Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse
     concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for
     selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps
     faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an
     Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and
     speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's
     affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline
                                        9
     represent prevailing market prices.

          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
                          10
     is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media
     other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be

               8
                See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases
          that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate
          power sales).
               9
                See supra note 4 and accompanying text.
               10
                 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a
          participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI
          is the buyer.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-
          and ER01-2103-000
                                                              11
     willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.
     Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product
     prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be
     any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via
     EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-
     affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically
     trade those products to attain similar benefits.

          Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be
     transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now
     turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions
     established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.
     Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE
     through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed
     restrictions that would require PGE to
     simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate
     offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with
     respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same
     offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its
     electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or
     will make the same offer to non-affiliates.

          Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited
     from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from
     knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,
     this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-
     market prices.

          The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal
     that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline
     will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's
     expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for
     inter-affiliate power sales transactions.  There is, for example,
     no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how
     unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would
     monitor inter-affiliate transactions.

          For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed
     amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their
     proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating
     appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.







               11
                 Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and
          sell at higher prices.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -6-
          and ER01-2103-000

     The Commission orders:

          Applicants' proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected,

     without prejudice, as discussed in the body of this order.

     By the Commission.

     ( S E A L )



                                        David P. Boergers,
                                              Secretary.

Today's FERC meeting was a big deal.   Some of the key actions are:

DSTAR and RTO West are to be "married,"  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can "heal its wounds." 
Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized.
The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.
Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO.
Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.

Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below:

Alan Comnes


The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to "marry up," meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an "RTO week" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some "sticks" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these "sticks" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how "FERC can get there."  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked


Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NOPR") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

MARKET NOTICE

For hour ending 0100 on June 21, 2001, the California ISO will implement the
following terms and provisions pursuant  to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") June 19, 2001 Order concerning market mitigation
measures for California and the Western System Coordinating Council.

FOR HOURS IN WHICH ISO DECLARES A SYSTEM EMERGENCY:

*	The ISO Real-time Imbalance Energy 10-minute and Hourly Ex Post
prices shall be set in accordance with FERC's April 26 Order, as clarified
by FERC's June 19 Order.
*	The Market Clearing Price ("MCP") for Ancillary Services shall not
exceed the Hourly Ex Post Price for the same hour in accordance with FERC's
May 25, 2001 Order, as described in the CAISO Emergency Notice-May 25, 2001
FERC Order On Implementation of the Price Mitigation Plan in April 26 Order.

*
*	FOR HOURS IN WHICH ISO DOES NOT DECLARE A SYSTEM EMERGENCY:
*
*	The ISO Real-time Imbalance Energy MCP shall be no greater than 85
percent of the highest Hourly market clearing price established when the
last Stage 1 emergency was in effect.
*	The ISO Ancillary Services MCP shall be no greater than 85 percent
of the maximum Hourly market clearing price established when the last Stage
1 emergency was in effect.
*
*	APPLICABLE TO ALL HOURS:
*
*	The system-wide gas price utilized to calculate the Proxy Price
mandated by the April 26 Order, as clarified by the June 19, 2001 Order,
shall be based on the simple average of the Gas Daily mid-point monthly
bid-week SoCalGas large package, Malin, and PG&E Citygate prices.  For June
2001 this average is $9.10/mmBtu.

*	The ISO is required to add 10 percent to the MCP paid to generators
for all prospective sales in its markets to reflect credit uncertainty.  The
prices posted on the ISO Web Site do not reflect the 10 percent mark-up.
Footnotes:
1 Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are used in the meaning set
forth in the Master Definitions Supplement, Appendix A to the ISO Tariff.
2  The ISO is implementing those provisions for which it can make the
requisite system changes immediately and will implement the remaining
provisions as soon as possible.
3 The maximum MCP for non-emergency hours selling into CAISO markets
effective June 21, 2001 and until after the next Stage 1 emergency shall be
$91.87, based on the highest hourly MCP during the most recent Stage 1
emergency of $108.08MWh.

The ISO continues to assess the June 19, 2001 Order and the steps necessary
to implement the Order.  We will be issuing subsequent Market Notices as may
be appropriate with respect to implementation of the June 19, 2001 Order.

BPA news:

FERC's June 19th Order makes non-public utilities, including federal power marketing agencies like BPA and WAPA, subject to price mitigation in the WSCC.  However, according to my counterpart over at BPA (BPA trading attorney Gerit Hull), BPA is disputing that it is subject to the price mitigation requirements of FERC's June 19th Order.  Apparently, BPA's argument is that it is not subject to the price caps because it is "non-jurisdictional."  (BPA will have to do better than this, because the "non-jurisdictional" argument simply begs the question, because it says "you don't have jurisdiction over us because, well, you don't have jurisdiction over us.")  BPA sees the FERC Order as a "political" move to take away BPA's independence, and is now sending additional reinforcements to the FERC settlement in Washington D.C.

I am told that due to the lack of settlement the Judge will recommend a refund based on a proxy MCP wherein there will be a daily or hourly heat rate multiplied by a DAILY gas price + O&M.  Emission costs would be justfied on a generator-specific basis.

The refund would only look at transactions 2 Oct. 00 - 19 June 01.  Note that refund orders have already come out so presumably this recommendation would  lead to a modification of  those existing orders. 

The modifications proposed to the June 19 order affect the refund caculation only; this does not change anything to the current mitigation rules.

To reiterate: the judges recommendation is just that and FERC has not yet ruled fromally.

More news to come.

US FERC-Ordered Calif Power Talks End Without Agreement

07/09/2001

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federally mediated negotiations between the state of California and power providers ended Monday without an agreement settling the state's demand for refunds for alleged overcharges. 

Throughout the fast track 15-day settlement conference California remained steadfast in its demand for $8.9 billion in refunds. But power providers offered a total of $716.1 million, according to the federal mediator overseeing the talks.

U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner said at the close of talks Monday that he will recommend that the commission use its June 19 price-mitigation order to retroactively determine refunds due dating back to Oct. 2, 2000. Such an approach is expected to result in a total refund far less than the nearly $9 billion sought by the state. 

The FERC ordered settlement conference "set the balls rolling," Wagner said. "In 15 days you can't work miracles," he said of the unresolved negotiations. 

Wagner said he would recommend that FERC order a fast-track hearing of 60 days or less to address the disputed issues unresolved by the talks. He also said he would recommend alterations in the June 19 orders pricing methodology to address "problems" involving power plant heat rates, natural gas pricing and the cost of emissions permits. 

Of the total $716 million in refund offers cited by Wagner, the so-called Big 5 Power Generators in California had offered $510 million. The remainder included $125 million offered by BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6 million by a group of 15 power marketers, $16.5 million by six California municipal utilities and $25 million offered by "load serving entities" outside California. 

"Many of the offers of settlement could with time result in an agreement," Wagner said. 

Wagner also noted that California came "close to settlement" with Calpine Corp. (CPN) during the negotiations. Calpine Vice President Joe Roman told reporters that the agreement with California was "close to gelling."

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting.  We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues. Generally, the order is expected to expand the scope of the Commission's April 26 Order, and this report will highlight the differences.

Geographical Scope-  Mitigation is extended to cover all 11 western states.

Term- The term of the order will be extended to cover 2 summers.  We expect the order to issue today.  If so, the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until 9/30/02.

Spot Market- Defined as sales of 24 hours or less, transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery.

Must Sell- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time.  All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market.   Sellers in the rest of the WSCC are similarly required to sell, except that they are not required to sell into California and can choose their spot market.  They will be required to post available power on the Western Systems Power Pool board.  Hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted.  

Price Mitigation-  Expanded to be in place 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Applies to all sellers, including marketers and non-public utilities.  The plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market, based on marginal cost bids. The proxy price formula is changed in several respects:

	1.	Gas price will be the average of the mid-point of the monthly bid week prices as reported in Gas Daily 		for Malin, SoCal Gas Large Packages and PG&E City Gate.
	2.	O&M increases from $2 to $6.
	3.	Fuel start-up and emissions costs are eliminated from the formula and uplifted from the ISO (i.e. these 		costs will be recovered from the ISO, but will not go into setting the proxy price).
	4.	Similarly, a credit adder of 10% will apply, only in CA. 

A reserve deficiency in CA (7% or less) also triggers mitigation for the rest of the WSCC.  The applicable price during reserve deficiency periods is the proxy price outlined above.  During times when no reserve deficiency exists, the mitigated price will be 85% of the highest price calculated in the last Stage 1 emergency.  This price will be in effect until the next Stage 1 emergency.  Sellers can bid higher than the proxy, with justification, during periods of reserve deficiency or when no reserve deficiency exists; PROVIDED THAT MARKETERS MAY NOT BID ABOVE THE PROXY PRICE.  FERC will consider the entire portfolio of a seller who seeks to justify a higher price than the proxy.  Generators may seek cost based rates for their entire portfolio in CA if they so choose (i.e. no cherry picking).

Demand Side Management- The plan originally set forth in the April 26 order is expected be removed in this order. 

ISO Reporting- ISO will need to report on a quarterly basis as to the status of building supply in CA. 

Comments- Comments will be sought on the issue of whether the price mitigation formula should be adjusted in response to expected varying load conditions due to seasonal changes.

Settlement Conference-  The settlement judge will convene a settlement conference on the refund issue no later than June 25 (next Monday) and the parties will have 15 days to settle.  A report from the judge to the Commission is due 7 days thereafter (for a total of 22 days).

Issues that are NOT expected to be addressed in the order include confidentiality, ISO board issues, ISO scheduling penalty application, and market based rate authorization.  The Order is not finally issued as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of a Final Order.  We will keep you posted.

URGENT

    WASHINGTON (AP)   Federal regulators voted Monday to order price
restraints on electricity sales across the West but not the
stringent cost-based controls sought by California.
    The 5-0 vote by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
followed intense pressure not only from California Gov. Gray Davis
and Democrats newly in charge of the Senate but also from House
Republicans worried that spiraling power prices in the West could
affect the 2002 election.
    FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert said the order, effective through
September 2002, will benefit consumers but also will ``provide
every incentive for suppliers to reduce costs.''
    The order expands price restrictions the agency imposed in April
on wholesale electricity sales in California during peak demand
periods when blackouts were threatened.

I have obtained a copy of a letter from Representative Tauzin and others to FERC Chairman Hebert which appears below.  It could provide some indication of the direction FERC will take with the order it plans to issue next Monday.  Summarizing, the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire WSCC, which plan should:

prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements; refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan

adopt market mechanisms (rather than imposing rigid price controls) and allow recovery of all verifiable costs

promote conservation and demand response 

Please see details below.




June 12, 2001
The Honorable Curt H

?bert, Jr.
Chairman
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First Street, NE
Washington DC, 20426

Dear Chairman H?bert:

Since last summer, the Committee on Energy and Commerce has closely
monitored the electricity situation in California.  Today, the West
continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century, and
California faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again
this summer.  After extensive review of the energy crisis in the West,
including several hearings in Washington and California, we recommend that
the Commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity
prices and keep power flowing into California.

We recognize the Commission's efforts in recent months to address the
electricity crisis in the California and western markets, including measures
to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices.  While we are
pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout
the West, we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale
electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in California and the
entire West in the hot summer months to come.  To ensure that prices are
just and reasonable during the critical months ahead, we believe the
Commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices
in western markets.  We strongly urge the Commission to implement a
comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor
wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market
participants within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC).

Specifically, such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale
electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the
WSCC.  The plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and
failures to comply with agreements to sell power.  If the Commission finds
that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan, it
should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the
full extent allowed by law.

Aware of the danger of discouraging supply, the Commission has relied upon
market-oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would
exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts.  We share
the Commission's concerns regarding the need to encourage supply.
Accordingly, to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long-term solution,
the Commission's comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as
appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging
availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission.

To mitigate prices and increase available supply, we also urge the
Commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote
conservation and demand response throughout the western market.  In States
where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs, consumers have less
incentive to conserve.  While demand reduction incentives are not a
substitute for accurate price signals, a demand response program can
encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity.
Such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both
wholesale and retail consumers to sell, at market or other incentive prices,
"foregone" electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume.
Specifically, the Commission should: (1) establish or certify a wholesale
"clearinghouse" for demand reduction agreements; and (2) enable consumers,
whether individually or through aggregation arrangements, to sell foregone
power to their own local distribution utility or to third-party purchasers.
We recognize that individual States and utilities are implementing demand
reduction programs, but a broader, regional solution is needed to enable
sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer.  We
understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting State
laws, abrogating existing contracts, or shifting costs to non-participant
consumers.

We look forward to working with you to build upon the Commission's previous
efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for
consumers in California and the West this summer and thereafter.  To ensure
maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead, we request that you
take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as
possible.  We request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not
later than the close of business on Friday, June 22.  If you have questions
please contact our staff.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation with
this request.

Sincerely,
W.J. "Billy" Tauzin

I attended the FERC Commission meeting this morning and it was short and refreshing.  Here are some high points:

FERC issues an order rejecting the proposed amendment to the CAISO creditworthiness provisions, and granting in part the complaint of the generators in the docket (which we supported).  The CAISO is ordered to enforce the existing creditworthiness provisions of its tariff and invoice CDWR for transactions with the non-creditworthy IOUs, within 15 days.  Otherwise, FERC will seek injunctive relief in court to enforce its order.  Also, a creditworthy party must be provided and bills paid, otherwise, the must offer requirement will be suspended (applies to California).  Commissioner Massey dissented on the suspension of the must offer requirement.  Wood indicated that he supported the order as written and quipped that "the ISO must now do what we told them to do the 3rd time!"  The remaining Commissioners voted in favor.

Unanimous vote on a 6-page order which establishes the FERC "business plan" on how it will move forward on RTO's, electricity market design and structure, so that faster progress can be made.

Watch for a future order relaxing the FERC's ex parte rules to facilitate communication between FERC and state commissioners.  The idea is that communications will be more freely made and that a transcript of the communication will be filed in the record of the proceeding to comply with due process and other legal requirements.

I gathered the above from the discussions held at the meeting as the draft orders are not yet available.  We will review them upon receipt, and update this e-mail if necessary.

According to this email, a "new OASIS system [will] soon . . . go online."  I assume that this is the new operating procedures that was mentioned in the earlier emails to Sue.  If we intend to file our ATC complaint, I therefore suggest that we do so tomorrow (June 1st), before the new OASIS system goes online.  We are ready to file.  Please advise.  Ron

Sue,

The ISO "rarely" operates with a TRM!!!!  Imagine that.

Dave,

*          Forecasted Day Ahead TRM is located on the Forecasted
Transmission
Usage Report - under the Forecast tab in the new OASIS system soon to go
online.  Although we are allowing for TRM reporting now, please keep in
mind
the ISO rarely operates with a TRM.  However on the few occasions that we
do
use a TRM, it will be reported here.

*          Forecasted Tie Meter Multipliers (TMM) are values used to
represent
the "adjustment" required to the power flows to effectively make the values
recorded at the meters represent the delivered value at the physical
location of the legal interconnection point.  To understand this concept,
it
is important to understand that the meters are not always located right at
the legal interconnection point, in fact they can be miles away.

Thanks,
Karen

FERC's press release on today's refund order.  As Ray noted, a written order may not be out for several days.

Note the very last paragraph where it states that the PNW will be put on the "same footing" as California w.r.t. refund considerations.

Western Wholesale Power Trades Fri Above FERC Price Limit    
Updated: Friday, June 29, 2001 05:42 PM ET   
  

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The price of power in the western wholesale market on Friday topped the limits set by federally ordered price controls, traders said. 

Bulk electricity trades as high as $107 a megawatt-hour in the western spot market were confirmed by one of the buyers. Also, Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, msgs) Internet-based trading system publicly offered to sell power in Nevada at $105/MWh.

The maximum price allowed under a formula set June 18 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is $91.87/MWh. 

Asked about the overshoot, FERC said sellers would have to justify prices above the benchmark. 

"We constantly monitor the markets out there," a FERC spokeswoman said. "If there is anything above the proxy price, they would have to come in and justify it." 

Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company posted the $105/MWh offer on its EnronOnline system, but didn't sell any power above the FERC limit. 

FERC's complicated price limits for the West set a maximum price based on the operating cost of the most expensive generator used to meet demand for electricity during power alerts in California. 

Suppliers who claim prices above the limits must explain why to FERC, which can order refunds if it isn't convinced. 

Some market participants point to a loophole. The FERC order only applies to "spot" market transactions, which the commission defines as deals done within 24 hours of the commencement of deliveries. But power traded Friday is for delivery Monday, so some market participants have said that the controls don't apply to Friday deals. 

"It does appear to be a loophole," Denne said. 

Gary Ackerman, executve director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry association, said that traders could start doing more transactions two days in advance to circumvent the FERC rules if market prices rise above the cap, which can change based on prices for natural gas. Or deals could be done at the cap with the seller adding non-monetary payments such as natural gas or free electricity delivered later in the year. 

Other market participants said they simply will buy needed power supplies at the market price, regardless of the FERC rules. 

On June 19, the first day the new rules took effect, hour-ahead deals were done at $300/MWh. So long as two companies agree to a price and the buyer doesn't later complain to the FERC, it seems that FERC would be hard-pressed to enforce its rules. 

If a buyer were to file a complaint after such a deal, it would quickly find itself locked out of the market when supplies become tight, traders said. 

The FERC spokeswoman said the above-limit prices would have to be justified even without a complaint. 

The price cap will be recalculated whenever the California Independent System Operator enters its next Stage 1 supply emergency. At that time the cap will likely be much lower, because gas prices have fallen significantly since the current cap was set.

Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate
By Bryan Lee

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.
The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO. 
The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers. 
FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. 
Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that "a bunch of bureaucrats" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of "what it does for local reliability." 
DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing. 
The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits. 
"We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest," the Public Power Council testified. "Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good." 
"Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest," declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities. 
"The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small," said a group of aluminum producers. 
Similar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast. 
'RTO Week' 

FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during "RTO Week" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate. 
"I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now," Wood said at an "energy community" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va. 
Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting. 
The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings. 
Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits. 
During the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators. 
Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as "economically dangerous." 
Arnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC. 
The state regulators want "an opportunity to be at the table," McRae said. If such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted. 
FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was "blindsided" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate. 
Later in the day, Wood told reporters that "RTO Week" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators. 
At the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition. 
"This process needs to be goosed," said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders "an external catalyst" to get the process moving. 
"If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that," he said.

Commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference, the Chie=
f Judge, in his down home manner, did not miss the opportunity to say that =
"you can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink."  Below is a C=
liff Notes version of the Judge's report and recommendation issued at 4:49 =
PM today.  Attached is the complete work. =20

The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- "While the amount of=
 such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the State of California, th=
ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billi=
on dollars in an aggregate sum.  ?At the same time, while there are vast su=
ms due for overcharges, there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller=
s by the CAISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California. =
 Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller=
?  The Chief Judge thinks not."  Another notable quote:  "?it is the opinio=
n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has=
 not and cannot be substantiated." =20

The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which wa=
s summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate=
 offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also =
rejected.=20
 =20
Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales =
in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge's recomme=
ndations do not go beyond that date.  "Spot market" sales are "sales that a=
re 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de=
livery."=20

Evidentiary Hearing- "The differences between what the State of California =
believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what =
the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater=
ial issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds =
involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-ty=
pe, evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to =
the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for an answer =
to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule=
.  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot=
ential refunds in this proceeding.  However, such a methodology may not be =
appropriate for all sellers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot markets in an =
after-the-fact refund calculation.    In any event, sellers not using the m=
ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede=
d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund =
period."

Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t=
he June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order =
to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS=
O's and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O=
ctober 2, 2000 through May 28, 2001. =20

Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates (asso=
ciated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order) pro=
vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.

Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based =
upon a daily spot gas price.  "In the event that the marginal unit is locat=
ed in NP15 (North of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for PG&E Citygate a=
nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the =
marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  If =
the marginal unit is located in SP15 (South of Path 15), the daily spot gas=
 price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t=
he marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  =
The daily spot gas prices should be for the "midpoint" as published in Fina=
ncial Times Energy's "Gas Daily" publication for the aforementioned deliver=
y points.  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the =
refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published (weekends and hol=
idays)."=20

O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the cal=
culated market clearing price. =20

Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma=
rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s=
ubtract from their respective refund calculation.

Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearin=
g price for all transactions that occurred after January 5, 2001 when PG&E =
and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.

Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service=
 prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea=
l-time imbalance energy market.  Adjustment bids would also be treated the =
same as set forth in the June 19th Order.=20

Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge r=
ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat=
ing refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85% non-emergen=
cy requirement of the June 19th Order.  To measure the amount that actual p=
rices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be recalculated=
.

Offsets-  "Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref=
und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char=
ges for the refund period.  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts=
 due from buyers would be recalculated.  Any refunds could then be offset a=
gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their=
 purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period."

Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless=
 the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.

Just heard this on an IEP call and wanted to pass it along.


SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer.  SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians.

We've been waiting for this shoe to drop for a while.

Please read this notice (copied below and also attached); I will be contact=
ing you next week for your thoughts on what Enron's position should be.

The very good news is the FERC is not asking the cap to be lowered; they ar=
e only asking to make it easier to raise it.

Regardless of our position, please be aware that this outcome of this case =
will likely be an increase in the probability that the cap could be raised =
above $91.87/MWh.

The earliest possible effective date of any change in methodology would pro=
bably be late November.

As a starting point for discussions at the conference, and based on the com=
ments that were filed, possible modifications to the current price mitigati=
on methodology include the following:  (1) eliminate the 10 percent adder f=
or sales into California; and (2) require the California Independent System=
 Operator to not only recalculate the price for spot market transactions wh=
en there is a Stage 1 reserve deficiency, but also recalculate the price wh=
en the average of the three gas indices increase by 10 percent above the le=
vel last used for calculating the mitigated price (i.e., 66 cents based on =
the current average of $6.64/MMBtu).

Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules 
 Electricity: Order will allow more production from heavily polluting 'peaker' facilities. 


By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer





     SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summer as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state. 
     State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts. 
     Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air Resources Board. 
     Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,200 megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so heavily. That is enough power for more than 1 million homes. 
     Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order. 
     In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have the effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened. 
     "If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired plants]," said Witherspoon of the air board, "we will see people turning to diesel more frequently." 
     Added Kellan Fluckiger, a top energy advisor to Davis: "If you don't run these, you're either going to have outages or you're going to run something dirtier." 
     Fluckiger said the order expands "the number of hours these things can run and the amount of energy they can produce." 
     New natural gas-fired power plants emit about half a pound per megawatt-hour of operation of ozone-producing pollutants. The plants affected by the order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawatt-hour. 
     If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours this summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air. 
     The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the extra pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 per pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 200,000 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money would be used to reduce air pollution from other sources. 
     "Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund," said Gail Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Our concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emission reductions any time soon." 
     A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one peaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivalent of adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Reliant Energy could not be reached for comment Monday night. 
     "To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's going to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to make our air dirtier," said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for Ventura County. 
     Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was needed so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power this summer. 
     "This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our excess capacity to the state," Wiggs said. 
     He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a price for the power. Wiggs said the city is "negotiating to get our cost as low as we can legally charge" so that customers of the city utility district are not subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state. Municipal utility districts elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the order. 
     Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell power to the state, it also applies to independent power producers such as Reliant Energy of Houston and Duke of North Carolina--both of which have called on Davis to ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gas-fired facilities. 
     "This puts more money in the Texans' pockets and more air pollution in Ventura County residents' lungs," said Baldwin of Ventura County. 
     Doug Allard, a Santa Barbara County air pollution control officer, also said it seems as if the governor is giving private power generators much of what they had sought. 
     "We have serious concerns about the order," said Feuer of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It's taking the discretion away from local air districts to regulate power plants in their region."

>From my sources:

CA ISO is filing jointly with SCE and SDG&E.  The comments begin with a tyrade that FERC has no right to condition price caps on joining an RTO.  Apparently, they weakly support regional organizations and note agreement to work with the other RTOs that are now forming.

PG&E is filing separate comments "because of its bankruptcy." PG&E will note concern about the CA ISO "independence" and talks about other RTOs as potentially good options.

The CPUC ordered and berated PG&E to file its comments with the CPUC BEFORE submitting them to FERC.  PG&E initially protested, but was threatened with fines.  It finally filed yesterday under seal.

Bottomline:

I believe that the joint ISO/IOU filing is structured to provide the minimal needed to meet the FERC test. Therefore, FERC's price caps will remain in effect.

Traders et al:

We learned at the hearing today that one bill mark-up being considered would not cap prices but  would require participants to forward contract for a significabnt portion of both load and resources.  If I learn more about this requirement, I will forward it on.

Also, the regional demand exchange seems to have legs in the current legislation.

US Lawmakers Postpone Calif Power Relief Vote To Fri    
Updated: Thursday, May 24, 2001 05:27 PM ET     
  
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The House Energy and Commerce Committee postponed until Friday a vote on legislation to relieve power shortages on the West Coast after working through Thursday on a compromise. 

The energy committee is deeply divided between free-market stalwarts, who argue temporary controls on California's wholesale electricity and natural gas prices will distort the market, and others who say price controls are needed to stop market manipulation and prevent a regional economic disaster. 

Earlier Thursday, Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., said talks between the two sides were "bearing fruit" and the committee scheduled to reconvene in the afternoon to vote on a bill addressing power problems in California and neighboring states. 

But the afternoon meeting was postponed twice as negotiations dragged on, and it was finally delayed until Friday morning. 

If the House were to approve temporary regional wholesale power price controls, the issue could reach a critical turning point. 

With Vermont Sen. James Jeffords' defection from the Republican party Thursday, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., is due to take over chairmanship of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Bingaman has proposed price controls for both Western states' wholesale power market and California's natural gas market. 

However, President Bush, an opponent of price controls, still wields veto power. 

The House energy committee's ranking Democrat, John Dingell, D-Mich., said Rep. Joe Barton's, R-Texas, Electricity Emergency Relief Act - the bill currently before the panel - doesn't live up to its name because it doesn't direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose wholesale power price controls. 

FERC Commissioner William Massey has proposed temporary price caps based on cost plus a reasonable profit, but he has so far been overruled by the rest of the FERC board. 

Some House panel members are also calling for stricter regulation of natural gas pipelines supplying California in light of the sharp spike in the state's gas prices and its effect on power generation costs. 

As it stood Thursday, Barton's bill, HR 1647, would include: 


- $220 million in funding to alleviate power transmission constraints on central California's "Path 15" system; 


- provisions to guarantee payment to small power producers threatened by electric utilities unable to pay them; 


- creation of a competitive market for power conservation; 


- and $100 million in new funding to help the region's low-income households pay electric and fuel bills.

Energy Novice to Be Paid $240,000 
 Power: Hefty annual salary goes to consultant with one year's experience in the field. State officials say she is doing a good job. 


By JEFFREY L. RABIN, DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writers





     The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a year's experience in the energy industry $240,000 annually to head a team of traders who secure California's daily electricity supply. 
     State officials hired Susan T. Lee, 30, in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov. Gray Davis. 
     Lee's contract is equal to the $20,000 a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman, a top utility executive for decades. 
     The two-year contract will pay Lee up to $480,000 to oversee the state's day-to-day energy purchases, totaling billions of dollars a year. 
     Lee's contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nation's largest power buyers, a role that it took on in January as California's utilities faltered. 
     Lee's contract was one of about a dozen released Monday, and among the largest. 
     Reached at her Sacramento office, Lee would not discuss her contract. She said only that she heads a 15-person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep California's power flowing. 
     Pete Garris, a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee, said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy. 
     He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu, her boss at Mieco Inc., a trading firm in Long Beach, recommended her. Shimizu refused comment Tuesday. 
     The state, according to Garris, must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game. 
     "You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary," Garris said. "Unless we can get permanent and full-time positions approved, these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire [consultants]." 
     Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lee's contract with the six-month, $120,000 deal that Freeman--the former boss at several major utilities--struck with the governor. 
     "I don't want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman," Garris said. "David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a [private] power marketer. With Susan, we just followed the standard formula." 
     In her new job, Lee will direct an immensely complicated, around-the-clock operation responsible for "procuring energy, scheduling power and associated transmission, and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries," according to her contract. 
     Lee's resume, attached to the contract, shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March 2000, when she joined Mieco. There, she was a trader and power scheduler, not a manager. 
     "She was only here for a year or so," said Dina Alvarez, an administrative manager for the company. 
     A 1994 graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics, she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco. 
     Lee's contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week, not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field. 
     She is being paid $120 an hour and can earn a maximum of $480,000, including expenses, by April 2003. 
     Another new consultant, William L. Green, has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration, Pacific Gas & Electric and the California Independent System Operator. He is being paid $85 an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the state's accounting of energy purchases. His two-year deal is worth up to $340,000. 
     They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals. 
     Richard Ferreira, the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District, has a $500,000 contract and is being paid $200 an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts. He worked for the Department of Water Resources for 23 years before joining the Sacramento agency in 1987. 
     Hardy Energy Consulting also has a $150,000, six-month contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid $300 an hour. Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience, particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration, where he was chief executive officer from 1991 to 1997. 
     Lee's recruiter, Garris, said her lack of experience is not a concern. 
     "So far she's done an excellent job," he said. "She has the skills, and she has the ability. She was doing a similar job." 
     Dozens of consultants, including Lee, have been hired since January, when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power. 
     The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric because they were no longer considered credit-worthy, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water Resources. 
     Hidalgo said that about 60% of the 95 people now working for the division are consultants. The rest are state employees. 
     As part of the process, Lee's unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed. Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months.

Subject:=09Re: FW: Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules

The following is more explanation about the recent Executive Order (EO) sig=
ned by the Governor of California on June 11, 2001.  In order to avoid futu=
re blackouts, Governor Gray Davis is waiving limits on hours of operation a=
nd the associated emissions for natural gas-fired peaker units if they adhe=
re to certain conditions.  He is requesting local air districts to allow na=
tural gas-fired peaker power plants to operate in excess of their hourly, d=
aily, quarterly and/or annual emission limitations if they do the following=
:

1.=09Agree to sell power to the California Department of Water Resources or=
 to a utility located in California=20
2.=09To serve an operating utility's own load
3.=09Agree to sell to another California-based utility

The gas-fired peaker units must also pay a mitigation fee to the local air =
districts of $7.50 per pound of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and $1.10 per poun=
d of carbon monoxide (CO) emitted.  (The Governor set this number - it is, =
however, the same amount the South Coast AQMD is charging for NOx offsets i=
n the modifications it made to the RECLAIM program.) These mitigation fees =
will be used to clean up or retire other sources of pollution in the same a=
ir basin.  The Governor is ordering the California Air Resources Board to w=
ork with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that power plants wi=
lling to operate under this order obtain the necessary approvals.

As you know, there are many peaking plants that are close to exhausting the=
ir allowable operating hours.  Once these facilities exhaust the amount of =
allowable hours they would have to either shut down the units or negotiate =
an agreement with the local air agency to continue to operate.  With the ex=
ception of Mirant Potrero in San Francisco and Reliant Energy Mandalay in V=
entura County, no facilities have negotiated such agreements.  The EO issue=
d by the Governor gives the peaker facilities a blanket approval to operate=
 beyond the restrictions.  The Governor believes that waiving of the requir=
ements will also minimize reliance on backup diesel-fired generators, which=
 have even higher emissions than the natural gas peakers.  In my previous d=
iscussions with the US EPA Region 9, they did say they were willing to work=
 with the state to provide variances to power plants' operating limits.  Ho=
wever,  in the two instances mentioned above, the EPA required the plants t=
o agree to install pollution control equipment at a specific future date.  =
This aspect of the agreement was critical to EPA, because the increased emi=
ssions from the peakers with increased hours are now significant enough (ma=
jor source status) to trigger New Source Review which requires installation=
 of Best Available Control Technology (BACT).  The EO by the Governor makes=
 no mention of future controls.

According to municipal utilities and other generators, the Governor's actio=
n could provide up to 1,200 Megawatts of additional power this summer by ex=
panding the number of hours of operation at natural gas-fired plants.   The=
 EO will expire on October 31, 2001, unless revoked, modified or extended b=
y further executive order.  The air director of the Ventura air board has a=
lready sent comments opposing this order due to its negative air impacts.  =
Environmentalists will also no doubt object.  The EPA has not yet responded=
.  Despite the potential negative environmental effects, the political pres=
sure will be strong to let these plants operate.  I will keep my ears open =
for additional developments on this matter, please let me know if you have =
any questions.

s this order any different than the SCAQMD $7.50/ton program already implem=
ented?  Will EPA allow that state to do this?

Thanks,

Alan Comnes

Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules=20
 Electricity: Order will allow more production from heavily polluting 'peak=
er' facilities.=20


By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer





     SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits =
on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this su=
mmer as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state.=20
     State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blac=
kouts.=20
     Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollu=
tion fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natura=
l gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air =
Resources Board.=20
     Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of W=
ater and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,2=
00 megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are pe=
rmitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute=
 so heavily. That is enough power for more than 1 million homes.=20
     Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air p=
ollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order.=20
     In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have =
the effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier die=
sel generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened.=
=20
     "If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired pl=
ants]," said Witherspoon of the air board, "we will see people turning to d=
iesel more frequently."=20
     Added Kellan Fluckiger, a top energy advisor to Davis: "If you don't r=
un these, you're either going to have outages or you're going to run someth=
ing dirtier."=20
     Fluckiger said the order expands "the number of hours these things can=
 run and the amount of energy they can produce."=20
     New natural gas-fired power plants emit about half a pound per megawat=
t-hour of operation of ozone-producing pollutants. The plants affected by t=
he order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawat=
t-hour.=20
     If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours th=
is summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of=
 oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air.=20
     The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the ext=
ra pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 pe=
r pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for 20=
0,000 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money wo=
uld be used to reduce air pollution from other sources.=20
     "Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and=
 pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund," said Gail R=
uderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. =
"Our concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in emis=
sion reductions any time soon."=20
     A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one =
peaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivale=
nt of adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Relian=
t Energy could not be reached for comment Monday night.=20
     "To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's go=
ing to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to m=
ake our air dirtier," said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for =
Ventura County.=20
     Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was n=
eeded so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power th=
is summer.=20
     "This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of=
 our excess capacity to the state," Wiggs said.=20
     He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a pr=
ice for the power. Wiggs said the city is "negotiating to get our cost as l=
ow as we can legally charge" so that customers of the city utility district=
 are not subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state. Municipal utility =
districts elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the orde=
r.=20
     Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell pow=
er to the state, it also applies to independent power producers such as Rel=
iant Energy of Houston and Duke of North Carolina--both of which have calle=
d on Davis to ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gas-fire=
d facilities.=20
     "This puts more money in the Texans' pockets and more air pollution in=
 Ventura County residents' lungs," said Baldwin of Ventura County.=20
     Doug Allard, a Santa Barbara County air pollution control officer, als=
o said it seems as if the governor is giving private power generators much =
of what they had sought.=20
     "We have serious concerns about the order," said Feuer of the Natural =
Resources Defense Council. "It's taking the discretion away from local air =
districts to regulate power plants in their region."=20

FERC has set a meeting for Monday18 June 10 am PDT wherein it has noticed its California and WSCC-wide dockets.  The meeting has been timed in advance of congressional hearings (by Senator Joseph Lieberman) that were set for later in the week.

Expect FERC to respond to intense political pressure to expand its current price mitigation measures, possibly to a WSCC-wide scope or to all hours, or both.

As far as I know Hebert is still President of the FERC, which would speak to less intervention rather than more.

We will forward information as we learn it.

US FERC To Meet June 18 On Western US Electricity Prices
  
06/11/2001

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has scheduled a special meeting June 18 to address pending matters involving electricity markets in California and neighboring Western states. 


The commission's meeting notice provides no details, except to list for discussion four cases involving price mitigation in, and the structure of, volatile power markets in California and 10 other Western states.


The meeting comes as members of Congress are placing enormous political pressure on the commission to take more drastic action to contain runaway electricity prices in the region. 


Last week, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., joined 21 Western-state congressional lawmakers to request an opportunity to appear before the commission to argue their case for cost-based price controls in the region's electricity markets. 


"At least twice, FERC has determined that the Western electricity market is 'dysfunctional' and that prices are 'unjust and unreasonable' under the Federal Power Act. Despite these findings, and contrary to the law, the commission has failed to bring these rates to just and reasonable levels," the lawmakers said in a letter to FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.

Attached is the press release concerning the 1:00 p.m. PST teleconference today.  The press release indicates the RTO filing will be available on the web site prior to the teleconference.


>>> <Susan.J.Mara@enron.com> 06/01/01 02:22PM >>>
>From my sources:

CA ISO is filing jointly with SCE and SDG&E.  The comments begin with a
tyrade that FERC has no right to condition price caps on joining an RTO.
Apparently, they weakly support regional organizations and note agreement
to work with the other RTOs that are now forming.

PG&E is filing separate comments "because of its bankruptcy." PG&E will
note concern about the CA ISO "independence" and talks about other RTOs as
potentially good options.

The CPUC ordered and berated PG&E to file its comments with the CPUC BEFORE
submitting them to FERC.  PG&E initially protested, but was threatened with
fines.  It finally filed yesterday under seal.

Bottomline:

I believe that the joint ISO/IOU filing is structured to provide the
minimal needed to meet the FERC test. Therefore, FERC's price caps will
remain in effect.

BPA short-term policy to encourage the use of small electric generation.

The Bonneville Power Administration hopes to establish a short-term policy =
to encourage the use of small electric generation to help the Northwest mee=
t its needs during the current energy shortage. Before implementing the pol=
icy in June, BPA wants to hear from the public on the details of the plan. =
The policy will encourage the immediate addition of electricity generation =
to help the region until planned long-term generation can be built. While B=
PA will not fund the construction of the generators nor buy the output, the=
 policy complements the load reduction strategy BPA has with its customers.=
 Customers who reduce their load on BPA by 10 percent would be allowed to u=
se temporary small generators to supply a small portion of their needs. BPA=
 has asked its customers to reduce their demands on BPA so BPA can avoid ex=
pensive large power purchases in the wholesale market. Such purchases could=
 lead to a triple-digit wholesale rate increase this October. The use of th=
e small generators, along with other actions such as energy conservation, c=
an help decrease reliance on BPA and thus help keep rates down. The generat=
ion plants would have to meet all applicable local, state and national regu=
lations. The temporary policy would apply from June 1, 2001, through Sept. =
30, 2002.

All:

Please review the attached rough arguments on what the FERC must do to fix it's current WSCC wide price mitigation mechanism.

Enron's (or its trade associations') filing(s) will attack bigger issues such as whether there should be price controls at all and whether the CAISO needs to be audited.  However, assuming we are stuck with a cap, I want to provide FERC with comments that at least allows marketers to stay in business.  The comments in the attached document are designed to address these "nuts and bolts" issues.  Formal comments are due next week but I need input from commercial folks like you by WEDNESDAY of this week.

Thanks,

Alan Comnes

Federal price limits backfire 
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, July 4, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle 

URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/04/MN186091.DTL 


Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states. 

The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning. 

The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages. 

"We need some clarity to this order," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of dollars to keep the state's lights on. 

"Generators need to be held accountable," he said. 

The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates during periods of high demand. 

Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost. 

"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park. 

Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect. 

"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts." 


BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies. 

"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network. 

The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights. 

Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage. 

"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences." 

Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices. 

"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said. 

The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101. 

Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended California's power crisis to neighboring states. 

"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said. 

'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES' 

California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output. 

"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan)," said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources. 

Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs. 

Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies. 

"No one answered," he said. "They were closed." 

State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response.

Ron,

No, I do not believe that this is the new operating procedure they were talking about.  I would think that an operating procedure would be one which would describe the use of TRM or some other mechanism by which they "adjust" the TTC/ATC.

As I understand the conclusion of the Gov't Affairs call today, the decision to file the complaint will be addressed at sometime tomorrow.  While some of us believe we should proceed with the filing as planned, others have voiced concerns that need to be addressed.  I would expect we'll talk tomorrow.

The reason I copied you on the original message was to provide you with more information from the ISO which states (something I didn't expect them to say) we rarely use TRM - If I where them I never would have put that statement in writing becuse that just took away their argument to explain the last 5 months of ATC reduction that we have observed!

Kind Regards,

Dave

According to this email, a "new OASIS system [will] soon . . . go online."  I assume that this is the new operating procedures that was mentioned in the earlier emails to Sue.  If we intend to file our ATC complaint, I therefore suggest that we do so tomorrow (June 1st), before the new OASIS system goes online.  We are ready to file.  Please advise.  Ron

Sue,

The ISO "rarely" operates with a TRM!!!!  Imagine that.

Dave,

*          Forecasted Day Ahead TRM is located on the Forecasted
Transmission
Usage Report - under the Forecast tab in the new OASIS system soon to go
online.  Although we are allowing for TRM reporting now, please keep in
mind
the ISO rarely operates with a TRM.  However on the few occasions that we
do
use a TRM, it will be reported here.

*          Forecasted Tie Meter Multipliers (TMM) are values used to
represent
the "adjustment" required to the power flows to effectively make the values
recorded at the meters represent the delivered value at the physical
location of the legal interconnection point.  To understand this concept,
it
is important to understand that the meters are not always located right at
the legal interconnection point, in fact they can be miles away.

Thanks,
Karen

Alan, et al,

It looks like the complaint filed by Morgan Stanley this past July, similar to the complaint we worked on regarding the ISO's TTC/ATC values and phantom congestion, is being attended to by FERC.  The Order attached to this message institiutes an investigation into the matter, orders the ISO to investigate intermediary actions which could be implemented to deal with phantom congestion in light of a total market redesign and orders an evidentiary hearing with an ALJ.

"The hearing should determine whether there are reasonable interim solutions available that would remedy this problem of "phantom congestion" for transmission users of the ISO grid absent a total market redesign.  We recognize that ultimately the regional market in the West must be operated under standard scheduling procedures that will apply to all market participants."

While the Morgan Stanley complaint did not address all of the issues ours did, it looks like they will be addressing the main issue, which essentially amounts to witholding of ATC.

Do we want to, or can we, participate in the hearing?

Thanks,

Dave

Traders et al:

Here's some background on why Reliant's dropping its CA peaking offer--they're holding out for a relaxing of the air quality regs.

Pressure builds on Davis to relax air standards  



Updated: May 24, 2001 - 2:22 p.m.  

A major electricity supplier said Thursday it will sharply cut prices 
for power from three Southern California plants in anticipation that 
air quality monitors will let the plants release more pollution this 
summer.  

Meanwhile, aides said Gov. Gray Davis will consider paying 
businesses to run heavily polluting diesel generators to boost the 
state's power supply and help avert rolling blackouts.  

Reliant Energy said it could chop its power bids from the high of 
$1,900 per megawatt hour Davis criticized this month to as little as 
$150 per megawatt hour -- but only if air regulators quickly allow it 
to exceed pollution standards at the three plants.  

The Houston-based generator will cut its prices immediately, but 
will soon be forced to shut down three of its five Southern California 
plants for the rest of the year if pollution standards aren't lifted, said 
Joe Bob Perkins, president and CEO of Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group.  

Davis singled out Reliant's $1,900-per-megawatt-hour charge earlier 
this month as an example of the egregious prices he said 
generators should voluntarily cut.  

Reliant said it deliberately bid the high price to discourage the 
state's power grid operator from calling its high-polluting plants into 
use. Using the plants now eats up valuable pollution credits that 
will likely be needed to keep the plants running during even higher 
demand periods this summer, the company said.  

"In essence, we are doing exactly what Gov. Gray Davis has 
suggested. But if these restrictions are not lowered, we will run out 
of power from these units very quickly," Perkins said in a 
statement.  

Perkins proposed that emissions hours not be counted against 
Reliant's yearly allotment whenever the plants are called into 
operation to help prevent blackouts.  

Reliant's Mandalay, Etiwanda and Ellwood plants each face annual 
air pollution limits imposed by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District and the Santa Barbara County and Ventura 
County air pollution control districts. Reliant has asked for 
extensions from each of the districts.  

"There's no question we are in an emergency situation. We will 
consider every option available" to avert blackouts, said Davis 
spokesman Roger Salazar. But he said the administration had not 
seen Reliant's proposal.  

Davis also will consider paying businesses to fire up their backup 
generators when necessary to avoid outages, Salazar said. 
Running the generators would let the businesses disconnect from 
the state's power grid, freeing up electricity for other uses.  

The proposals have consumer and environmental groups outraged.  

"It's a short-term fix that will have potential long-term health 
consequences," said Paul Knepprath of the American Lung 
Association of California.  

The state should instead cut demand by encouraging more 
conservation, the lung association and 18 other consumer and 
environmental groups said in a letter to Davis on Wednesday.  

Davis already is promoting conservation, but blackouts have health 
and public safety consequences too, Salazar said. The use of 
backup generators is being proposed by the administration's top 
energy advisers, but Davis has not yet seen the proposal, Salazar 
said.  

The governor is willing to "explore every conceivable option for 
generation this summer," Salazar said.  

The twin developments come the same week the administration cut 
by 20 percent its estimate of new power generation that will be 
available this summer. Davis now projects 4,000 additional 
megawatts, 1,000 megawatts short of his original estimate. A 
megawatt is enough power for about 750 homes.

Below is an importnat announcement from the CAISO about its OASIS upgrade implementation, I know some may have received it, but I believe it is important that we be sure all the right folks there in Portland have reviewed it. 

If there are any questions regarding this message I'll be happy to work with the CAISO to clarify any questions.

If there is anyone else in Portland who should review this message, please pass it along.

Kind Regards,

Traders et al:

Recently you've seen and will continue to see news in the press about FERC inquiries into natural gas prices at the California border and the West:

1. On Thursday, 24 May 01, FERC will be holding a technical conference in Washington DC on natural gas transportation infrastructure.  Enron will be making comments at that conference emphasizing that only increased supply or decreased demand will bring prices down.

2. Yesterday, FERC released an inquiry into whether it should re-impose the as-billed cap on short-term (less than 1 year) releases of transportation capacity.  FERC is considering re-imposing the cap in the entire WSCC, not just California.  Enron's view (which it will present in formal comments due in 20 days) is that re-imposing the cap will do nothing to affect the California border price as it is driven by supply-demand fundamentals.  However, you will likely see claims that reimposing the cap will bring rate relief to gas customers, including EG customers.  Attached is a copy of this latest FERC inquiry.

If you have any question, please contact me.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy
            Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: May 23, 2001

RE: FERC Gas Orders Issued 5/22

Late yesterday FERC issued two gas orders, which are attached. In the San Diego Gas and Electric/LADWP Order the Commission requests comments on whether it should reimpose the maximum rate ceiling on short term capacity release transactions into California.  The second is a more detailed notice of the schedule for tomorrow's staff technical conference on California Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure.  We will discuss possible EPSA responses to the request for comments on our weekly conference call and the Gas Issues Working Group on June 7th.  If you have any questions, please call Julie Simon at EPSA (202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org).

Sue, did you see this emergency motion the CAISO filed today?  Apparently
they are requesting that FERC discontinue market-based rates immediately and
grant refunds plus interest on the difference between cost-based rates and
market revenues received back to May 2000.  They are requesting the
commission act within 14 days.  Have you heard anything about what they are
doing?

Diana-

  I'll have a more definite answer tomorrow, but for now, it looks like we're current with SCL except for a variance of approx $1000 for January 2001 and $7000 for December 2000.  Hiope this helps for now.

Late in the afternoon on Friday May 25, FERC issued an order providing clarification and preliminary guidance on implementation of the mitigation and monitoring plan for the California wholesale electric markets that it adopted on April 26. The order is limited to clarifying four critical issues prior to the Mitigation Plan's May 29 (today) effective date: (1) treatment of generators who did not supply heat and emission rates; (2) calculation of a natural gas proxy price; (3) price mitigation in the ISO's spot markets other than Imbalance Energy; and (4) creditworthiness.  The order does not resolve the rehearing requests, nor does it accept or reject the ISO's proposed tariff amendments for filing.  These pleadings are still under review and FERC will address them in a separate order.  

Treatment of Generators Who Did Not Supply Heat and Emission Rates

FERC accepts the ISO's proposal for generating units within California (including non-public utility generating units) that have not supplied heat and emission rates in compliance with the April 26 Order:

For the generating units that have not provided the requisite data or whose data the ISO believes to be inadequate, the ISO will use data from a viable alternative source (e.g., either current or pre-existing Reliability Must-Run Contracts).  If an alternative source of data does not exist and the generating unit continues to refuse to supply the requisite information, the ISO will treat the non-compliant generators as price-takers, i.e., the ISO will assume a $0/MWh bid for all available capacity from these units.  These generators, if dispatched, will be paid the market clearing price.  

The FERC finds that to the extent a non-compliant seller does not wish to be treated as a price-taker, the ISO's approach will provide such entities with an incentive to provide the ISO and the Commission with the requisite data.

Calculation of a Natural Gas Proxy Price

FERC rejects the ISO proposal to calculate a proxy natural gas cost based upon the simple average of Gas Daily index prices for Malin, PG&E CityGate, and Southern California Border (Kern River Station).  The ISO is directed to calculate the natural gas proxy price using the published daily prices for Malin, PG&E CityGate, Southern California Border (Kern River Station), SoCalGas large packages, and PG&E large packages.  The Commission will consider whether any changes should be made to the California delivery points during rehearing of the April 26 Order.      

Price Mitigation in the ISO's Spot Markets other than Imbalance Energy

The FERC finds that the ISO erred in its interpretation- that it does not intend to apply any price mitigation to its Ancillary Services spot markets or Adjustment Bids. The April 26 Order did not explicitly address the issue of price mitigation in any market other than that for Imbalance Energy, the order nonetheless noted that "this proceeding was established . . . to address whether a price mitigation plan was needed to replace the $150/MWh breakpoint methodology."  The $150/MWh breakpoint methodology applied to the ISO's Ancillary Services markets.  Therefore, the ISO must replace the $150/MWh breakpoint methodology in those markets with the superseding methodology adopted in the April 26 Order.  The Commission further clarifies that the April 26 Order did not replace the ISO's current methodology for mitigating Adjustment Bid prices.

With respect to calculating the market clearing price for Ancillary Services, FERC directs the ISO to use each relevant average hourly mitigated Imbalance Energy price.  If the Ancillary Services markets clear below the average hourly mitigated Imbalance Energy price for that hour, then the ISO will pay the Ancillary Services clearing price for that market.  If the Ancillary Services markets clear above the average hourly mitigated Imbalance Energy price, then the ISO will use that price to clear the market and will pay as-bid for all Ancillary Services that are needed above the mitigated price.  Bids accepted above the mitigated price will be subject to refund and justification.  

Creditworthiness

As of May 29, 2001, FERC expects the ISO to ensure the presence of a creditworthy buyer for all transactions made with all generators who offer power in compliance with the must-offer requirement in the Mitigation Plan.

Subject: RE: WECC


In order to explain who WECC is, I must lay a little historical background.=
  If you will recall, when EPAct'92 was passed, the usual view was that FER=
C could order wheeling, but only on a case by case basis.  There had been a=
n effort to include an RTG provision in the bill, but it died when the conf=
erence committee was finalizing the bill.  There was a view by many in the =
West at the time, that it would still be better to move ahead with self-imp=
lementation of open access rather than waiting for litigation.  In the summ=
er of 1994, first WRTA (Western Regional Transmission Assocation) then SWRT=
A (Southwestern Regional Transmission Association) and NRTA (Northwest Regi=
onal Transmission Association) were filed.  They were developed in an open =
process that included, perhaps for the first time, the transmission owners,=
 the transmission dependent utilities, new market entrants and state regula=
tors.  The IPPs and Marketers were participants, including Enron, Electric =
Clearing House (now Dynegy), DesTec, CalPine, Tenaska, etc.  FERC responded=
 in November telling WRTA that it would have to accept comparable transmiss=
ion access.  Instead of collapsing as predicted by the "just say no" crowd,=
 the members accepted the conditions and accepted those conditions.  WRTA f=
ormed in June of 1995. =20
=20
While the RTGs appear rather tame today, at the time they challenged the tr=
aditional view, offering to provide open access tariffs.  When the FERC iss=
ued the NOPR that gave us Orders 888/889 just prior to WRTAs formation, the=
 participants in the three Western RTGs members responded during the summer=
 of 1995 by working together to develop the key concepts of what became OAS=
IS.  With the filing of the current OATTs, much of the ground breaking work=
 of the RTGs was done, but they remained a forum for discussion of the inte=
rface between commercial and reliablity.  A common planning data base was d=
eveloped in which included non-traditional participants and their ideas to =
be included.  The Western Market Interface Committee (WMIC) was organized b=
y the RTGs and has had a continuing role in bringing the the three (soon to=
 be two?) RTOs proposals together.
=20
When the Western RTGs were organized in 1995 they were formed outside of WS=
CC.  WSCC had a very restrictive policy, allowing only utilities to be memb=
ers.  When they grudgingly allowed IPPs to join, it was still by half-measu=
res.  For instance, WSCC would allow only employees of the member to attend=
, so new, small members could not employ a consultant for joint representat=
ion.  When the RTG discussions were underway, the good old boys wanted it i=
nside WSCC with the same kinds of restrictions.  We broke that mold, formed=
 separately and then through the FERC order approving WRTA force WSCC to op=
en its membership fully or to face the creating of a separate planning orga=
nization.  The change passed by one vote, but the change occured.
=20
Once all the organizations were up and running (WSCC, WRTA, NRTA, SWRTA) it=
 was obvious that there was substantial duplication of meetings and functio=
ns.   Serions talks of a merger began in about 1998.  They went very slowly=
, but finally produced a common organization to be called the Western Elect=
ric Coordinating Council (WECC), which would merge WSCC, WRTA and SWRTA tog=
ether initially.  NRTA will likely vote to merge as well.  WECC is a RRG as=
 far as NERC is concerned. =20
=20
While the new bylaws do not go as far as I would have liked, they do furthe=
r open up the WSCC process and provide for some consideration of the commer=
cial impact of reliablity rules.  Is this a transitional phase? Perhaps.  D=
oes it go as far as the EISB proposal?  No, but I see no reason to play "sm=
ash-em, bash-em" will every effort that hasn't followed the latest turn in =
our thinking.  As I hope this memo shows, we have been evolving the industr=
y, never as fast as Enron or others (myself included) have wanted it to cha=
nge.  The WECC will reconsititue the WSCC board under new membership rules =
and opens the possiblity of changing the entrenched senior staff as WSCC to=
 breath some life into the organization.  At a minimum, the change from WSC=
C/WRTA/SWRTA/NRTA to WECC will provide interim improvement while the debate=
 over EISB works its way to a conclusion and further change takes place.

This is the first I have heard of WECC.  I assume it is a "Western" NERC -t=
ype organization?=20

 I understand that the traders in the West are not too concerned about form=
ing single standards applicable to both the East and West.  They would howe=
ver, like to see more consistency in practices between TPs within the West =
itself.  Sounds like WECC may be able to do this. One of the big problems w=
ith the WSCC has been that it was not as stringent in dictating operating r=
equirements on its members as the East has tried to be.   At NERC, WSCC mem=
bers have always argued deference to the West due to system differences.  U=
nfortunately deference to the West has meant little to no standardization i=
n the West over many transmission access practices, leaving it up to the su=
b-regions or individual TPs to decide.  I am not saying they are not techni=
cally justified, but there has been no incentive to bring about more consis=
tent practices.

Is WECC consistent with EISB?  It depends, if WECC is sovereign over any ot=
her organization for standards approval, then I would say no.  I think WECC=
 should be subject to the EISB process and have to get standards approved t=
hrough EISB as well.  The problem is that EISB is voluntary and if WECC can=
 go directly to FERC, then it becomes effectively the same as "deference to=
 the West" -type language we have been fighting against. =20

So my verdict on WECC depends.....=20
As I noted in an earlier note, I believe there are those pushing for NERC t=
o continue doing "reliability-only" and establish a contractual relationshi=
p to coordinate with EISB.  The WECC could take the same approach.  If this=
 scenario plays out, I believe customers will leave NERC and put their mone=
y into EISB.  We must then work towards making NERC merely a transmission o=
perators' advocacy group ( i.e. EEI is transmission owners advocacy group).=
  They can exist to focus on reliability - but have no direct standards set=
ting authority.  They must be a member of EISB and participate as a member =
in one of the market sectors.

If anyone has any more info on WECC, please share it.=20

What do we think of FERC's approval of the new WECC this week?  As I unders=

Sean,

Here are my initial answers and I encourage others to provide me with their thoughts.

Subject:	Comments on order

Here are some questions/comments I have regarding the ruling.

1.  How does the cap apply to index prices.  If the DJ-PV index settles at $120 and the cap is $98, do parties selling index have to adjust there price to $98?

Depends on the term off the deal and when it was confirmed.  If the deal is longer than 24 hours in length or was negotiated in advance of day of/before, the price is not capped.  If you do a "spot" deal (as defined by FERC) and agree to use the  index price, you will need to condition it to be the lower of index or the cap.

2.  Would financial products (swaps) be affected by the cap?

[Mark Hall]  I believe not.

3.  There has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets.  For example, assume it's a Monday and the ISO is under normal conditions and the price is $92.  Then assume on HE 14 the ISO declares a stage one and the price clears at $100 and the price is $100 for the rest of the day.  Tuesday assume the price is $85 during the first few offpeak hours, but the Wednesday forecast shows identical conditions as Monday.  What is the day ahead cash cap trading Tuesday for Wednesday?
Is it $85 or $100?  One could make the argument that it should be $100 because it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on Wednesday, but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage one.
[Mark Hall]  
See my seperate note where we got sympathy but little hard clarification from FERC.  

It seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an independent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price was before the cash market traded.  So for the example, they may recognize it's likely a stage 1 $100 cap will be in effect on Wednesday, so they'll set the cap at $100.  The market will know before hand and there will be no ambiguity.  More efficient market, less litigation.

Enron is very concerned about giving CAISO discretion to set the cap and will raise this issue on re-hearing.  There must be some way to set the cap so that it is known at the time business is transacted and that its computation is easily verified.
4.  What about call options?  If a generator owns a call option at $125, the cap is $100, but the market is actually trading $150, does the generator have the right to exercise the option?  What if the generator has a plant that he can fire up at $150.  Does the generator have to wait until the price hits $150?  Seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demonstrable expense.  And would there be a difference between a marketer owning an option and a generator owning an option?
[Mark Hall]  
We should talk more about this, especially if you would like Enron to raise this on rehearing.  The order is basically silent on options.   The generator must make power available at its marginal cost.  I do not think the cost of an option is an allowable expense unless it can be traced back to an actual generator costs. If a marketer calls and option and then has the power it must sell below the cap, so I think in your example the FERC order reduces the value of the option.

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants "may have crossed the line," said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
"The governor's approach may be convenient for him," said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, "but it ignores the law." 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest," Knox said. "Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing." 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. 
"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks," the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. 
"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer," Mead said. "[He] just said your services are terminated. 
"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns." 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
"I don't see a conflict," he said. "At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron." 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards," he wrote. "That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters." 
"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person." 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide "financial advisory services" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide "financial advisory services" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.

Traders et al.

Here is information from John Shelk of our  D.C. office on the liklihood of price caps.  The "news" about the market curves falling (which makes caps pointless) is starting to filter out.  However, in the mean time, the basic buzz is that increased power from the Dems in D.C. will likely lead to a vote for price caps and, if nothing else, increased pressure on FERC to "do more" than what it has already adopted on April 26.  "Doing more" could mean WSCC wide caps, caps on all hours (not just emergencies), or both.

More to come as we know more ...

Subject:	Status Report On Price Caps

This e-mail summarizes our conversation earlier today about the current,
albeit fluid, situation on price caps and related issues in Washington.
The short answer is: increasing likelihood of legislative action in favor
of some type of price caps or price mitigation, although still unlikely to
be enacted into law; growing pressure from a variety of sources for FERC to
"do more" -- all while we understand that market prices are coming down as
fundamentals change.

In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to resume
consideration tomorrow of the Barton California emergency bill.  As of this
writing, there is no bipartisan agreement on some pricing limit mechanism
-- which is of course good news since some rather bad ideas had been
floating around.  The mark up will only occur if Republican Members elect
to go forward following a closed meeting tonight.  Democrats will offer the
cost-of-service-based rate amendment offered in subcommittee.  Republicans
may counter with an alternative that would extend the FERC price mitigation
rule to the entire West and for all hours.

In the Senate, the change in control to Democrats is widely read as
increasing the chances of a committee vote or floor vote on price caps --
depending on market and political developments.  However, incoming Sen.
Majority Leader Tom Daschle has said he doubts price caps would be enacted
into law, largely because of Republican opposition.  Incoming Senate Energy
Chairman Bingaman is seen as wanting to lean on FERC to act rather than
have Congress enact a price cap -- although he has cosponsored the
Feinstein-Smith price cap, he wants to give the new FERC commissioners a
chance to act.
