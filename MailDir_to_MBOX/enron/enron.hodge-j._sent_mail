The Homestead precedent agreements are going out this week.  They should be
self explanatory but please call your account manager or me with any questions
or if you need clarifications.  Thanks again for your interest in our project.

Attached is the interconnect data sheet for Athens.  You and Raimund may want to update it for site specific criteria that has been identified since they changed the power plant site point.

No economics or overview/summary, but I would talk to Brad McKay about the basis.  In the past we have valued Leidy at CNG North in the summer and Tetco M3/Transco NNY Z6 in the winter, but Brad has probably refined this by now.  Gas Daily has suggested that they will come out with an index for the point starting this November.  However, they still don't know what liquidity the point will bring.

John,

I met with Con-Ed last week.  They asked if Market Link @ Leidy was going to be good liquid point to buy long term supply.  I told them that I didn't think so but would do a little research for them.  I know you worked pretty hard on this one.  Do you have an overview/summary that  I could look at including some rough economics.

Jack,

Thank you for the letter.  I have added some detail regarding Phase VI and the fact that capacity shortages for SE Florida begin around Station 20.  In addition I would like to delete the last sentence of the last paragraph.  Please take a look at these changes and revise so that you are comfortable with them.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-0433.

We are meeting with Florida's DEP tomorrow and would like to present this letter to them at the meeting.  Therefore, I would like to get a copy of the letter on your letterhead later today.  

Best regards,
Raimund D. Grube

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.
