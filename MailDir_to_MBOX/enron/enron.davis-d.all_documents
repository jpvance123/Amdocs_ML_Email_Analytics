Good morning ladies,

     The ballet is still on for Tuesday.  I had originally planned to pick
up each girl, however, I am on special assignment on the Southwest side of
time.  So, if you would, please have take them to Carolyn Ashley's house by
6:15 pm.  The ballet begins at 7:30 pm.  If they are not able to go, please
let me know, so I can make arrangements to take another girl.

Denise

Envision is DocView's replacement.  Below are a few tips I hope will make 
using Envision a easier for you.

The GO TO Function is located at the bottom of the page between the green 
directional arrows (Page where document is displayed).  When using the GO TO 
Function please type in the page number you would like to go to and press the 
TAB key.  If you press the Enter key it will temporarily lock your 
application and it will be necessary to end the task causing an illegal 
logoff meaning your password will need to be reset or your must wait 20 
minutes to log back in.
It is important to keep your temp directory clean.  Please try to check this 
before you open any applications.  To check your temp directory to go to My 
Computer, double click on C:Drive, Temp Folder, you will want to delete any ' 
.tmp' documents.
Text Search drop down box  (Flashlight on screen where image is displayed).  
Type in the information you want to search on.  When the information is 
found, the information will be displayed  on a separate Yellow Page and the 
text you searched for will be displayed in red.  You can not print this 
page.  At the top of the top of the Yellow Page the following information 
will be displayed:  
  Occurrences of '2320-310' found in 8651330:200

 You searched for account 2320-310, it was found in document number 8651330 
on page 200.

 To view or print this information you must first close the text search box 
as well as the  Yellow Page.

 Go to the page of desired information using the GO TO as described above.  
To print the pages 
 containing the information searched for  (To print selected pages, you must 
be on the beginning page of the desired range),  You can now click on the 
Print Icon

It is recommended you access Envision through the Envision Web Page located 
at http//:home.fan.enron.com/envision.

Remember to check any entries you may have with a posting date of 11/1/00 or 
later and to accounts 60000000-79999999 to make sure you replace the profit 
center with a cost center as discussed below.  If you need to set up a cost 
center you will need to request it through lotus notes.  

Double-check your entries before you have them keyed in case they do need a 
cost center but are not kick out when keyed.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Per Stacy Aune concerning this issue, her understanding is that a manual 
entry will be kicked out unless a cost center is entered for applicable 
accounts.  If you have entries to accounts 60000000-79999999 you should 
replace the profit center with a cost center for entries with a posting date 
on or after 11/1/00.  Most profit centers have one or more related cost 
centers assigned to them per the Standard Hierarchy Report but some do not.  
If your chosen profit center does not have a related cost center let me 
know.    

Keep in mind that this is only for accts. 60000000-79999999 and most of those 
accounts are not used by our group.  However, we do use some of the accounts 
such as 62000000 Interest Income - Third Party, among others.  

Cost Centers are only needed for these accounts for entries with a posting 
date of 11/1/00 or later.  If you are doing 10/31/00 close entries, do them 
the same as you have been.

Since we are in the middle of 10/00 close and this issue does not affect 
10/31/00 entries, I will remind everyone in November to review this issue for 
their entries.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin,
 Can you please coordinate this by Friday, November 10th.  We should have 
profit centers set up for all of our companies, but I am not sure about cost 
centers.  Please refer to the Standard Hierarchy Report.   Let me know if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: Spreadsheet for Review - New Cost Elements (60000000-79999999)

As most of you may already know, beginning November 1st  (Sorry, we got this 
Friday afternoon!), the 60000000-79999999 range of accounts will now require 
a cost center instead of a profit center when using those accounts.  Some of 
the accounts that this range includes is Interest Income/Expense, Gain/Loss 
on Foreign Currency, and Gain/Losses on Disposition of Assets.

Unfortunately, the processes that are run automatically by the ISC that 
eventually book to these accounts, will hit a default cost center on each 
company if one is not specified.  This is very similar to the derivation 
pooling profit center 12951.  The ISC is giving us the opportunity to specify 
by company/account what the default cost center should be for each account.

Please review the attached spreadsheet below.  It contains a row for each 
company and shows the default cost center the ISC has chosen for each account.
 

Please respond back to me with the following:

1)  Confirmation that you have reviewed and agree with the cost center that 
has been chosen for each account on your company

    -OR-

2)  An attachment with the changes you desire the ISC to make with regards to 
your default cost center by account

These changes will affect any posting date of November 1st or later.  For 
those of you who have FX revalution on your companies, this change will have 
an effect in October close when the FX program is run after the last workday.

I need a response from those companies with FX revalution ASAP.

For the remainder of the companies, I would like a response by Friday, 
November 10th.

Thanks for your efforts in advance and sorry for the short notice,

Stacey

Subject: Spreadsheet for Review - New Cost Elements (60000000-79999999)

I promise this is the last note about this today.

The attached spreadsheet has all the default cost centers we have loaded in 
the system for the accounts listed below.  We  have made an initial attempt 
to do this for you.    It is not required to use the same default cost center 
for each of these accounts on a company code.  Previously when these defaults 
were assigned at the profit center level, you were only allowed one default 
profit center for a company code.  We are not encouraging multiple default 
cost centers for these accounts, but we just want to offer the flexibility.

Please review the attached file, and forward me any changes you would like 
made.  You may only need to review the fields in yellow & green.  I have 
already sent you a note regarding the "No CC" fields that are in red.   We 
are only entering the default cost centers for the accounts that had activity 
on your company codes in year 2000.  That is why there are a lot of empty 
fields you do not have to worry about.   We will continue to add and modify 
the cost center defaults on an as needed basis.

Use this information to help you analyze the spreadsheet:
Accounts in black The accounts in black were already cost elements and 
already had the default cost centers assigned.  
Accounts in blue- The accounts in blue are the new cost elements.  If there 
was an existing default cost center for a company, we have already assigned 
it to    the new accounts in blue.  

Yellow  We selected a default cost center from the values assigned to  the 
default profit center for that company code.
Green  There was not a default profit center so we reviewed the cost centers 
on that company and selected the one we thought was most appropriate.
Red  This company code did not have any cost centers.  I have already asked 
you for these in a previous email. 



If you make changes, please move them to a spreadsheet by themselves or make 
them easy for us to identify in this spreadsheet.   Thanks again for all your 
help.  

Accounts posted to automatically by the system



* Already a cost element before this new process.

That sounds nice but if we continue to make programs for M.O.P.,  I would 
like to use the short ones.





Hey what do you think of this one, I even thought we  could give what ever
ones you won't use for the church's programs on Sunday.

> HOW DO YOU LIVE YOUR DASH?
>
>   I read of a man who stood to speak
>  At the funeral of a friend.
>  He referred to the dates on her tombstone
>  From the beginning...to the end.
>  He noted that first came her date of birth
>  And spoke the following date with tears,
>  But he said what mattered most of all
>  Was the dash between those years. (l900-l970)
>
>  For that dash represents all the time
>  That she spent alive on earth...
>  And now only those who loved her
>  Know what that little line is worth.
>  For it matters not, how much we own;
>  The cars...the house...the cash,
>  What matters is how we live and love
>  And how we spend our dash.
>
>  So think about this long and hard...
>  Are there things you'd like to change?
>  For you never know how much time is left,
>  That can still be rearranged.
>  If we could just slow down enough
>  To consider what's true and real,
>  And always try to understand
>  The way other people feel.
>
>  And be less quick to anger,
>  And show appreciation more
>  And love the people in our lives
>  Like we've never loved before.
>  If we treat each other with respect,
>  And more often wear a smile...
>  Remembering that this special dash
>  Might only last a little while.
>
>  So, when your eulogy's being read
>  With your life's actions to rehash...
>  Would you be proud of the things they say
>  About how you spent your dash?
>
>
> Makes a lot of Sense.
> Top

Hi Denise,

I really appreciate your note - and yes, it will be great and a tremendous
BLESSING to see my sisters in Jesus... I will place that on my calendar; I
generally take some time off that time of the year, so I will be looking
forward to it.  What a wonderful celebration it will be... Since I live so
far; no one really has to help me; but if they want to, it would be greatly
appreciated; but mostly I hope that lots of ladies come... When you told me
that y'all eat anything, that's fine with me; just let me know a few days in
advance, how many people you think will be coming and I'll be ready...I love
to have people come together in my home... it will be a blessing...

There are several reasons that I'm not available lately - the main one being
of course, I'm working approximately 12-15 hours a day - it is a very trying
time for me right now and I need all the prayers that I can get; please
continue to do that; the other reason is; I'm physically tired; I'm 53 years
old and have been having lots of responsibility for most of my adult years!

I was been blessed to be able to come back to Houston 12 years ago and was
afforded an opportunity to buy a new home and was at that time within 15
minutes of my job (not anymore); hence I live "quite" a ways from church -
by distance approximately 38 mi.; by time depending on whose doing the
driving(smiles) and which way you come approximately 45 min. So after years
and years of having to drive so far at least 6 days a week, I'm tired...

God bless you and the Women's Ministry for thinking of me and my family at
such a special time in any Christian's life and I look forward to the
fellowship.  Keep me posted.

Love and God's grace to you,
Ruby

Good Morning Ruby,

     I hope God has found favor with you this morning.  I have a request of
you.  I don't know if you remember in May when we talked about having a
women's ministry meeting at your home.  Well, we met briefly last night and
we are requesting that you, your mother, and aunt allow us to come and share
with you during the Christmas holiday.  We would like you to co-host the
meeting in December.  We are looking for a Saturday, due to Pastor Wallace
having class on Sunday's now.  We would like to know if you would be willing
to co-host on December 16.  The reason I say co-host, is we always partner
up with someone.  And we want to afford you the same opportunity.

     Our meetings generally consists of prayer, praise and worship.  We
sing, do bible study and just fellowship with one another.  During
Christmas, we also do a gift exchange.  We buy one $10 gift for no one in
particular, put numbers on them and them draw the numbers out of a hat.

     We thought the celebration of our Savior's birth would be a good time
to come and pray with and for your family.  Please let me know.  I hope to
see you soon.  We really have been missing you.

Be Blessed,
Denise

Dana,

     All I know is take 45 south to Galveston.  Take the first(61 st) exit
(you will see the sign for Moody Gardens).  Turn right at the light.  Take
it all the way to the Seawall Blvd (which is the acutal seawall).  Turn left
on the Seawall.  It will down on your left hand side.  The Galveston Hilton
Resort and Conference Center  5400 Seawall Blvd.

Dear Dana,
?
Thank you so much for that inspirational story and  poem. I really needed to 
correct my spiritual perspective today and the Lord  blessed me with a word. 
I had been focusing so much on my own situation, (which  in the scheme of 
things is not that bad) that I lost sight of how greatly I have  been blessed.
?
Scripture says that all things (situations) in  Christ work together for the 
good for those who believe and are called to his  purpose.? I truly believe 
that,?and  have faith that God is working out everything for me.? 
?
We really have not had an opportunity to talk and  really get to know one 
another, but I feel that we are already connected in the  spirit.? I 
appreciate your prayers.? I appreciate you as my sister in  Christ.
?
Well, I'd better go now.? May God continue to  bless you and your family in a 
mighty way.? Hope to see you at Powertime  tonight!!!!!!
?
Love Ya,
?
Betty

Hold off on pulling together this information.  I need to have several 
clarifying questions answered by AA and also to sit down with Dana tomorrow 
to see if she can help me with most of the exercise.  I will need all of you 
to fill in any potential gaps and verify the information I pull together 
before I submit it to AA.

Thanks,

?? Right now, you're 3 for 5 on forgetting and always the same response.
Doing better next time.
I'm sitting here wondering at the age of 35 what makes ME happy. Do I really
know? What can I do to find out. What about those those things that do not
make me happy? The only thing to say in with you in mind. Is. You've managed
to be at both ends of the spectrum and not all by yourself. What I'm getting
at is. . . The only time(s) I've experienced periods of pain (with one
exception) with you is when you're involved with ANOTHER MAN. . . . . . . .
PREOCCUPIED on your part. That was someone more important to you, and was
that way for awhile. Now recent developments have occurred that's telling my
heart that history my be repeating itself. I know what you've told me, but
it seems all too familiar. Hey, this is me. Do what you want and who you
want to. I know that sounds familiar. You said, that things at Work and Home
have you mentally preoccupied. What's different from the first 2 times you
remembered and then with the last 3 times you forgot? Coincidence?  We both
know that Kevin will always be that Lazy/Self-Centered/Spoiled Brat of an
A##Hole, until he wants to do something for HIMSELF. As for work. You got it
good. I understand about that Childish-boy you call a Co-worker. And
everything associated with that mess. I could very easily use that same
excuse you did about forgetting anything. Have I ever forgotten you on
anything, regardless of what was going? ? ? Well. . . I'm waiting. ? ? ?
Sometimes I think I should be more of a Self-Centered/High Strung A##hole
and look out for myself. Maybe I wouldn't feel the I do about a lot of
things. But then again, Back to what's real. We're not Married, just
friends. At least, when I was reminded of that last week. Do whom that makes
you happy. You're a grown woman.
Well, I'll be here for you to tell me how wrong I am about everthing that
I've said. And I want you to do it with both barrels.

P.S.
I thought Birthdays other than Valentines Day and X-mas was a day that you
can show that special person how special they are to you. That must have
something I read in a Far Side cartoon clip or fiction novel somewhere.
Maybe I'm asking for too much.

I can't undo what didn't do or did but,  if you will allow me to apologize
for being preoccupied and self-centered I will make it my business never to
forget your birthday again.

After a discussion with Stacey we have decided to change the coding of the 
wires referred to below.  Please code per the original wires to 24091000, 
Profit Center 12854, Transaction type E09.  

Dana is sending the original wires back to you.

Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,

Rosemary,
Dana Davis is sending the original wires back to you to enter into the A/P 
system for the month of January.  The wires have been sent out to Southwest 
Bank of Texas so you will only be entering this information into the A/P 
system but NO WIRES SHOULD BE SENT.

Please code (Debit) these 3 wires to 30016000, Profit Center 12854 (as marked 
on the wire request).  

Should you have any questions or problems, please call me at 853-5961.

Thanks,

     Yes, its too late and  AP  Dept. Dec. closing was not open on 1/2 the 
only way to booked for Dec  is to do it yourself by Journal Entry.  Dana has 
the wires it was sent back with her
last week.   If you have any questions please let me know.

Rosemary,

This needs to be entered in December 2000 in A/P.    Is it too late?  I sent 
the addresses on 1/2 and I heard A/P was still open for December on that 
date.  Yes, it will mess us up if you enter this is January.  What are the 
options?

Here are the addresses you needed for three wires processed in December that 
you faxed to Dana last week.  These are December payables, so they need to

Subject: Vacation

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

Green Garden Grass snakes can be dangerous, Yes, grass snakes, not
rattlesnakes.

A couple in Sweetwater, Texas had a lot of potted plants, and during a
recent cold spell, the wife was bringing in a lot of them indoors to
protect them from a possible freeze.

It turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of
the plants and when it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it
go under the sofa.

She let out a very loud scream. The husband who was taking a shower ran out
into the living room naked to see what the problem was.  She told him there
was a snake under the sofa. He got down on the floor on his hands and knees
to look for it.

About that time the family dog came and cold-nosed him in the butt.

He thought the snake had bitten him, so he fainted.

His wife thought he had a heart attack, so she called an ambulance. The
attendants rushed in and loaded him on the stretcher and started carrying
him out. About that time the snake came out from under the sofa and the
Emergency Medical Technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher.

That's when the man broke his leg and why he is in the hospital.

The wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on
a neighbor man. He volunteered to capture the snake.

He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the
couch. Soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the
sofa in relief. But in relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions,
where she felt the snake wriggling around.

She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa, and the
neighbor man seeing her laying there passed out tried to use CPR to revive
her.

The neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery
store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband
in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and
cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches. An ambulance was
again called and it was determined that the injury required hospitalization.

The noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying
on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed that he had
been bitten by the snake. She went to the kitchen, brought back a small
bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.

By now the police had arrived. They saw the unconscious man, smelled the
whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred.

They were about to arrest them all, when the two women tried to explain how
it all happened over a little green snake. They called an ambulance, which
took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife.

Just then the little snake crawled out from under the couch, One of the
policemen drew his gun and fired at it. He missed the snake and hit the leg
of the end table that was on one side of the sofa.

The table fell over and the lamp on it shattered and as the bulb broke, it
started a fire in the drapes. The other policeman tried to beat out the
flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog,
who startled, jumped up and raced out into the street,  where an oncoming
car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car and set it
on fire.

Meanwhile the burning drapes had spread to the walls and the entire house
was blazing. Neighbors had called the fire department and the arriving
fire-truck had started raising his ladder as they were halfway down the
street. The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires and put out the
electricity and disconnected the telephones in a ten-square city block area.


Time passed -----------------


Both men were discharged from the hospital, the house was re-built,

The police acquired a new car, and all was right with their world

-------

About a year later they were watching TV and the weatherman announced a
cold snap for that night. The husband asked his wife if  she thought they
should bring in their plants for the night.

She shot him.

One day in the Garden of Eden, Eve calls out to God.  "Father, I have a
problem!"

 "What's the problem, Eve?"

 "Lord, I know you created me and provided this beautiful garden and
all of  these wonderful animals and that hilarious comedic snake, but
I'm
just not  happy."

"Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above.

"Lord, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples."

"Well Eve, in that case, I have a solution.  I shall create a man for
you."

"What's a man, Lord?"

"This man will be a flawed creature, with many bad traits.  He'll lie,
cheat and be vainglorious; all in all, he'll give you a hard time.
But...he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things.
He will look silly when he's aroused, but since you've been complaining,
I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs.
He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and
kicking a ball about.  He  won't be too smart, so he'll also need your
advice to think
properly."

"Sounds great." says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow. " What's
the catch, Lord?"

"Well...  you can have him on one condition."

"What's that, Lord?"

"As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring...  So you'll
have to let him believe that I made him first.  Just remember, it's our
little secret... Y'know....Woman to woman..."

 The holidays are fast approaching and rather than the customary floor pot

cookies, cakes, candy, etc.) strategically placed all over the floor.  

 The goodie days will be December 12, 13 and 14th!

 If you would like to participate, please send your admin an e-mail that 
includes what you would like to bring!!!   We can go back to our diets in 
January!!!

Good morning ladies,

     The ballet is still on for Tuesday.  I had originally planned to
pick
up each girl, however, I am on special assignment on the Southwest side
of
time.  So, if you would, please have take them to Carolyn Ashley's house
by
6:15 pm.  The ballet begins at 7:30 pm.  If they are not able to go,
please
let me know, so I can make arrangements to take another girl.

Denise

Willie -

Have I sent this to you before?



> This is a good one, let me know what you think!  I laugh every time I read

> Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked

> lively reaction on him.
>
> One day he met a girl and fell in love.  When it became apparent that they

> Shortly after that they were married.

> A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down and
since

be

> the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him.
>
> Since he still had several miles to walk, he figured he could walk off any

>
> His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited.  She exclaimed,
> "Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!"
.
> She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the

Good Morning!

If I understand correctly you need the paths for the flexfiles for fair value 
& equity earnings.
Fair value templates are located O: Stfin/Acctng/Sap Finance/Gl upload 
template

The equity earnings templates are saved where their respective  EE schedules 
are kept because they are linked.
I thought it would be easier that way. 

Co. 914 & 915 EE ---O: Stfin/Acctng/Jedi2/Entries/CS-914-915-EE
Co. 957 & 961 EE ---O: Stfin/Acctng/Enserco/EqEarn/2000EqEarn/CS-957-961-EE
Co. 398 -----O: Stfin/Acctng/Jedi/EE schedule/CS-398EE

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: ACT: New DSS Change Password Procedure  



To All DSS Users,

Currently there is no mechanism for changing your password on DSS.  

On May 15, 2000, we will be putting a new procedure into effect that will 
function similarly to the LAN change password procedure.  Passwords for DSS 
users will begin to expire in early June, and every 60 days thereafter.  You 
will be receiving 5 Password Expiration e-mails as the deadline approaches.  
Each of these messages will notify you that your DSS password will expire in 
the specified time interval.

These e-mails will be sent as follows:
E-mail  #1 - 2 weeks before expiration date
 #2 - 1 week before expiration date
 #3 - 2 days before expiration date
 #4 - 1 day before expiration date
 #5 - The day the password expires

We now have a new module that will allow you to change your password.  When 
this module is executed, a window will display which will prompt you for your 
current password, New password, and repeat New password.  There are certain 
criteria that the new password must meet for it to successfully change.  
Follow the instructions on this window to choose a new password.  You may run 
this module anytime, but once you change your password, the module must be 
closed before it can be run again.

Please Detach (double-click) the following module and save it in the location 
that you normally save your DSS modules/databases.  This may be on your hard 
(C:) drive or personal (H:) drive.  As long as you remember where it is, it 
really doesn't matter where you save it.  When the time comes, Execute 
(double-click) the module to change your DSS password.





If you have any questions or problems, please call the DSS HelpDesk at 
x31555, option 6 OR Lotus Notes e-mail at GPG DSS.

Thank you.

Lola -

You know that I wouldn't be asking you this but this is ONLY if  it's 
possible.  Some how I've gotten myself into a crunch and I need to know if I 
can get some money from you.  I'm not quite sure of what our balance is but 
is there any way I can get $40 or $50 from you?  My electric bill is $320 and 
it was due yesterday.  I called them and told them that I could pay half b/c 
my car note is due this pay period too.  Let me know if you can help.

These are the prayer request as follows...

Sheryl Snoddy - for faith and total trust in God to supply all of her needs.  
Complete and total healing for her mate who indulges in alcohol abuse and 
verbal abuse toward her in front of their son Devon.

For those of you who are thinking about contributing, I would like to suggest 
we get each of the managers a Leeds Benchmark Durahyde Zippered Padfolio 
($15) for each .  If everyone participated, it would be less than $5 each.  
They are nice and we can get them from the Signature Shop.  Let me know what 
you think.

I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but what I was trying to convey was that
Rev. Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group
by-way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up
the concerns that was given to us in the hand-outs and also anything else
that God lays on our heart.

The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque
mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that
we could be on one accord. I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us
is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not
assembled together on Monday night.

 I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on
Wednesday's, there will be some definite strongholds torn down. What do you
think?

I have already asked my team members to block out every Wednesday morning
from 8am to 12pm for our fast time and it was feasible for all (Bonnie,
myself, Cheryl S. & Betty).  If we need to change our time to comply with
all the members of the prayer ministry, let me know and I will get the word
out.

God Bless All

Matthew 18:20 states "For where two or three are gathered together in My
name, I am there in the midst of them".

Greeting My Dear Sisters In Christ,

It has been suggested by our Prayer Ministry Leader that we establish a
common time for our Organized Units to pray. It seems as though Tuesday
night at 9:30 pm would be the  most convenient, at this present time.

It is my discernment that tonight should be our starting date. Please make
every attempt to comply with this endeavor in order that we may attack the
strongholds and be unified in  the body of Christ.

If this is not conducive for your schedule please suggest an alternative.

Be Blessed
Edith:-)

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Dave and John

Dana,

Yes, 4 tickets should be included in the card.  

Can you and Rufino take care of sorting and handing out the mail daily?  I

Have a great weekend!

As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in 
Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process.  In fact, your system has just 
been inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working 
with your local department coordinator to consolidate this information to 
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please contact Jose Favela at (713)345-5878.

If I wasn't there what would you do? Yes, I received your e-mails, I can only
hope that somehow our relationship will never subside, because you mean a lot
to my life.

HI.  I'm so overwhelmed at the goodness of God.  Know ye not that it's the 
goodness of God that leads a man to repent.  I feel like I just got a new 
boyfriend that I want to spend all my time with.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ok-Ok.  
I just wanted to share a scripture with you girls.  

Hebrews 4:12 - 
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged 
sword, 
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints 
and 
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

I'm so excited and encouraged to continue in this race.  I'm so thankful that 
God is teaching me through you and His Word that this race is not given to 
the swift, 
neither to strong but to the one that endures to the end.  Keep pressing my 
sisters!

Love You,

Dana

Hello Dana,

Yes.... I am still giving Edith her bridal shower on this upcoming weekend.
And I do believe your name was included in the invitations that were sent
out, which was this past Monday.  So you should be receiving directions as
well as the invitation sometime this week.  Thanks for inquiring, and hope
to have you join us on Saturday.....talk soon....

Hope this little note finds you doing well.  Didn't we have a wonderful time 
of fellowship last night.?  Claudette had such a fresh anointing on her.  She 
spoke so beautifully.

Listen, I have your email adress but not your phone #.  Is the some reason

Hello Dana,

 I trust that all is well for you and yours.  I'm e-mailing you to get a
message to Kevin for me about Lay Speaker's School.  As Kevin may be
aware there is a two year membership rule within the book of discipline
before an individual can apply for the ordained ministry within the
United Methodist connection.  Until such time that he has been a member
for  two years he may want to attend the Lay Speaker's School on March
17th and 25th that will give him some training in some strategic areas of
ministry that will provide him with some additional tools to use in his
quest for the ministry.
 If he is interested please ask him to contact me for more information.
I've been meaning to tell him directly but everytime we are together I
forget about it.  So since I'm at the computer I decided to e-mail you so
that you can remember (smile).
 Thanks for everything!

Thank you so much for taking the initiative to pray for me. God bless you and 
your prayer warriors. I am a strong believer and I have put all of my trust 
in God. I would like to also share with you that a friend of mine had to have 
one of her breast removed on last week and I know it was a test of her faith. 
She does nothing but minister to  everyone through prayer, words of 
encouragement;  and now this has happened to her to trust and be challenged 
in her faith. I do believe I will be okay and I also believe you heard my cry 
for a reason. I do need your prayers and everyone else's. I do need your 
prayers so that I can be at peace.
Thank you so much for caring. I will definitely keep you posted between now 
and next Thursday December 21st when I go in for my Ultra Sound.

Your friend in Christ,
Davette

Subject: prayer


	

Davette, 
Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter 
that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at 
my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of 
our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage 
you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the 
effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly 
stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and 
we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try 
to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have 
received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, 
government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really 
don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us 
around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt 
we hurt. : )


I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

HI.  I'm so overwhelmed at the goodness of God.  Know ye not that it's the
goodness of God that leads a man to repent.  I feel like I just got a new
boyfriend that I want to spend all my time with.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Ok-Ok.
I just wanted to share a scripture with you girls.

Hebrews 4:12 -
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged
sword,
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints
and
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

I'm so excited and encouraged to continue in this race.  I'm so thankful
that God is teaching me through you and His Word that this race is not given
to the swift,
neither to strong but to the one that endures to the end.  Keep pressing my
sisters!

Love You,

Dana

: )  I couldn't resist.  Attached to this email is a Word document that lists 
all the MOP members names, addresses and phone #'s.  I plan to revise it more 
with email addresses and alternate/emergency phone #'s but for now will you 
help me fill in the blanks where possible?  Later, if every one approves, we 
can distribute this.  Let me know what you think.

Lots of Love for my sister in Christ.

 Please check with Cindy Stokes to see if she can tell you if there is going 
to be filing cabinets and where.  Thanks.

Subject: Archiving/Move

Some of the accountants have been able to flag a few items that can be 
archived but it has only been a very little.  Most of them are asking the 
same question.  They want to know if there will be file cabinet space to 
store the items that they are  not ready to send to archive but have no room 
to store on their desks?  This is placing a hold on the archiving project 
because I can't archive anything that the accountants won't give me the go 
ahead on and quite frankly,  this is nearly everything I touch.  Please 
help.  Maybe if they knew where their things were going to be stored,  I 
could at least help box it up for them to move with them.  Thanks.

Dorothy -

I spoke to Rebeka this morning regarding that administrative position.  I'm 
not quite sure how it went but I want to thank you for speaking to her on my 
behalf.  Although she is looking to fill this position within the next two 
weeks, she mentioned that if this didn't work out for me that she would 
forward my resume to the HR Recruiter, Dianne White.  And if I may ask,  just 
keep me in your prayers.  Thanks again.


Dana

Good morning Duck, I especially liked this prayer this morning and wanted
to share it with you. Please don't forget to put money aside for Candis on
tomorrow.  I wouldn't ask for it if  I hadn't been spending money left &
right
for additional things like extra food and toiletries for company. She will
also
need spending money. The 1-day pass is $13.00 .

: FW: Today's Verse -- Matthew 6:15


Always be willing to forgive....Jesus forgives you!





Thursday, June 15, 2000

VERSE:
   But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not
forgive your sins.
    -- Matthew 6:15


THOUGHT:
   Can you think of a more frightening thought than God not
forgiving our sins?  We know how much he paid so our sins could be
forgiven!  We know how much he loves us!  We know how much he wants
us to be in relationship with him!  So why would he withhold his
forgiveness?  Because we demonstrate that we have not received it
or do not understand it!  God is gracious and he will not accept
those who are not gracious!

PRAYER:
   Holy God, there are those that I do find it difficult to
forgive.  Please, right now while I'm praying, soften my heart by
your Spirit, cleanse my soul of any bitterness or resentment, and
please empower me to let go of the pain of the past and forgive.  I
thank you for this grace to not only be forgiven, but to also
forgive.  In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

Hi Denise,

I really appreciate your note - and yes, it will be great and a tremendous
BLESSING to see my sisters in Jesus... I will place that on my calendar; I
generally take some time off that time of the year, so I will be looking
forward to it.  What a wonderful celebration it will be... Since I live so
far; no one really has to help me; but if they want to, it would be greatly
appreciated; but mostly I hope that lots of ladies come... When you told me
that y'all eat anything, that's fine with me; just let me know a few days in
advance, how many people you think will be coming and I'll be ready...I love
to have people come together in my home... it will be a blessing...

There are several reasons that I'm not available lately - the main one being
of course, I'm working approximately 12-15 hours a day - it is a very trying
time for me right now and I need all the prayers that I can get; please
continue to do that; the other reason is; I'm physically tired; I'm 53 years
old and have been having lots of responsibility for most of my adult years!

I was been blessed to be able to come back to Houston 12 years ago and was
afforded an opportunity to buy a new home and was at that time within 15
minutes of my job (not anymore); hence I live "quite" a ways from church -
by distance approximately 38 mi.; by time depending on whose doing the
driving(smiles) and which way you come approximately 45 min. So after years
and years of having to drive so far at least 6 days a week, I'm tired...

God bless you and the Women's Ministry for thinking of me and my family at
such a special time in any Christian's life and I look forward to the
fellowship.  Keep me posted.

Love and God's grace to you,
Ruby

Good Morning Ruby,

     I hope God has found favor with you this morning.  I have a request of
you.  I don't know if you remember in May when we talked about having a
women's ministry meeting at your home.  Well, we met briefly last night and
we are requesting that you, your mother, and aunt allow us to come and share
with you during the Christmas holiday.  We would like you to co-host the
meeting in December.  We are looking for a Saturday, due to Pastor Wallace
having class on Sunday's now.  We would like to know if you would be willing
to co-host on December 16.  The reason I say co-host, is we always partner
up with someone.  And we want to afford you the same opportunity.

     Our meetings generally consists of prayer, praise and worship.  We
sing, do bible study and just fellowship with one another.  During
Christmas, we also do a gift exchange.  We buy one $10 gift for no one in
particular, put numbers on them and them draw the numbers out of a hat.

     We thought the celebration of our Savior's birth would be a good time
to come and pray with and for your family.  Please let me know.  I hope to
see you soon.  We really have been missing you.

Be Blessed,
Denise

Subject: prayer


I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

: )  I couldn't resist.  Attached to this email is a Word document that lists 
all the MOP members names, addresses and phone #'s.  I plan to revise it more 
with email addresses and alternate/emergency phone #'s but for now will you 
help me fill in the blanks where possible?  Later, if every one approves, we 
can distribute this.  Let me know what you think.

Lots of Love for my sister in Christ.

Good Morning Ducky!

WHY JESUS IS BETTER THAN SANTA CLAUS

Santa lives at the North Pole...
JESUS is everywhere
Santa rides in a sleigh...
JESUS rides on the wind and walks on the water.
Santa fills your stockings with goodies...
JESUS supplies all your needs.
You have to wait in line to see Santa...
JESUS is as close as the mention of HIS name.
Santa lets you sit on his lap...
JESUS lets you rest in HIS arms.
Santa has a belly like a bowl full of jelly...
JESUS has a heart full of love.
All Santa can offer is ho,ho,ho...
JESUS offers HELP, HEALTH, AND HOPE.
Santa says, "You better not cry..."
JESUS says,"Cast all your cares on me for I care for you."
Santa's little helpers make toys...
JESUS makes new lives, mends wounded hearts, repairs broken homes, and
builds mansions.
Santa may make you chuckle but...
JESUS gives you joy that is your strength.
While Santa puts gifts under your tree...
JESUS became our gift and died on a tree.
Remember, to keep CHRIST in CHRISTmas...
JESUS is the reason for the season.

=09=09Assert Yourself At Work =20
=09=09
=09=09Do you feel taken advantaged at your job? Are you being handed other =
people's=20
work? If so, it's time for you assert yourself and set boundaries to keep=
=20
your sanity.=20
=09=09
=09=09People who are considered the "saviors" on the job often have a fear =
of=20
rejection or are "people pleasers." To keep your sanity in check, you must =
be=20
willing to "rock the boat." Quitting is not the answer, because this scenar=
io=20
will probably occur again in your next job. It is you who is creating=20
problems for you--not other people.
=09=09
=09=09Assert yourself by talking to your supervisor about how you feel abou=
t the=20
situation and how you wish to resolve it. (Have a solution in mind BEFORE y=
ou=20
approach your boss.) You'll feel better once you take some control over a=
=20
situation. Do not let your emotions keep you from gaining some control in=
=20
your work. This is where stress comes from: "The lack of control."

Let's just give the devil a Holy Ghost Fit in the name of Jesus!
Father, bless everyone on this list in a special way, open supernatural
doors in their life today, give them a double portion of your Spirit as we
take back everything that the devil has stolen from us: Health,
Finance,Children, Jobs, Homes, Marriages.  Amen.

Let's take time to pray.
Take  60 seconds & give this a shot!
Let's just see satan stop this one.

All you do is:
1)    simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you this,
2)    then send it on to five other people... within hours five people
have prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of people to pray to God for
other people...then sit back and watch the power of God work in your life
for doing the thing that you know He loves.

God Bless You!!
Flora

Subject: Blue Jean Shirts


All,

      Here is the information on the blue jean shirts.  The exact price is
as follows:

M - XL         $22.65
XXL             $23.90
XXXL           $25.15

Please turn in your money to me as soon as possible.  The total for all the
shirts we have ordered is $551.  I have already made arrangements to pay for
half up front, due to such a high dollar order.

Pass the word on to those not on e-mail (Evelyn Morris, Evelyn Jackson, Nina
Nazir-ud-Din, Pamela Watts, Annette Richardson, Georgia Gillum, Danise
Johnson, Jackie Stewart, Marylyn Green, Ethel Ford, Cheryl Sumbler, and
Cheryl Curry). We need to try and have the money by Powertime on Wednesday.
If you need an accomodation, please let me know.

If you know of anyone else wanting a shirt, please get with me as soon as
possible.  I thought maybe the following might want a shirt (Rev Jacque,
Bobbie Poledore, Katherine Dailey, Valerie Piper).  It would be nice if all
women had one.

Also, thank Joe Stewart when you see him, for making all the arrangements
for us.

Thanks,
Denise

-----Original Message----- 


" To all of my friends, I do not usually forward messages but this is 
from my 
good friend Sheila Coleman Bantz, (She is our Soiree Queen)." 

She received this message from her friend Pearlas Sanborn who is an 
attorney.....If she says that this will work - it WILL work. After all, 
what have you got to loose? 

Anna V 

SORRY EVERYBODY.....JUST HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!! 

I'm an attorney, and I know the law. This thing is for real. 
Rest assured AOL and Intel will follow through with their promises for 
fear of facing a multimillion dollar class action suit similar to the 
one filed by PepsiCo against General Electric not too long ago. 

We're not going to help them out with their e-mail beta test without 
getting 
a little something for our time. 

My brother's girlfriend got in on this a few months ago. When I went to 
visit him for the Baylor!/UT game. She showed me her check. It was for 
the sum of $4,324.44 and was stamped "Paid In Full". Like I said before, 
I know the law, and this is for 
real. 

If you don't believe me you can email her at ( jpiltman@baylor.edu .) 
She's eager to answer any questions you guys might have. 

Intel and AOL are now discussing a merger which would make them 
the largest Internet company and in an effort make sure that AOL 
remains the most widely used program, Intel and AOL are running an 
e-mail 
beta test. 

When you forward this e-mail to friends, Intel can and will 
track it(if you are a Microsoft Windows user) for a two week time 
period. 


For every person that you forward this e-mail to, 
Microsoft will pay you $203.15. 

For every person that you sent it to that forwards it on, 
Microsoft will pay you $156.29 

and for every third person that receives it, 
you will be paid $17.65. 

Within two weeks, Intel will contact you for your address and then 
send you a check. I thought this was a scam myself, but a 
friend of my good friend's Aunt Patricia, who works at Intel actually 
got 
a check of 
$4,543.23 by forwarding this e-mail. 


Try it, what have you got to lose????

I didn't have a check off list of the ones that I made copies of and 
submitted but I do know for sure that I turned in Co.272.  Marnie worked on 
them late made a comment about that Co. having a lot of schedules.

Subject: Manual JE info for cutover weekend

Attached is the template to be used for inputting manual FI and CS journal 
entries for cutover weekend.  The template will be used for both June 
Hyperion entries that were made and need to be input into SAP for June, as 
well as for any manual entries that didn't get into June MSA or Hyperion but 
need to be reflected in SAP for June (an example would be an intercompany 
imbalance that didn't get corrected by June in Hyperion).  There are some 
Hyperion entries that were made in June that shouldn't go into SAP, such as 
entries that were made to record equity earnings in consolidated subs.  These 
specific entries were made for tax reasons, but going forward, SAP will 
record these entries automatically.  If you have any questions about whether 
or not a Hyperion entry should be included in SAP, please contact me or Cindy 
Morrow.

There will be a box in Cindy Morrow's office to drop off any entries that 
need to be made.  We are requesting all manual entries converted from June 
Hyperion entries to be dropped off no later than noon on Thursday.  This will 
allow time for the SAP team to key in the entries prior to Saturday so the 
data will be in SAP when we get to work on Saturday morning.  Please include 
copies of the Hyperion entries and any other support with the SAP manual 
entries.  For any other entries that need to be made this weekend, we are 
requesting these to be dropped off as soon as possible after the Hyperion 
entries are converted and complete.

I will be available the remainder of the week to assist anyone who needs help 
converting Hyperion entries to SAP, or preparing an entry that hasn't been 
reflected in either MSA or Hyperion as of June but you would like included in 
SAP for June.  Please call me or email me to set up a time.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Pam

Sometimes I clown a lot and I never really say that you are a very unique and
special person in my life. I feel that without you sometimes I would have a
complete void that would yearn to be filled. I really care about you more
than you could ever imagine. I have the utmost respect for you and I will
never do anything that will jeapodize our relationship and friendship,
however I am committed to wait on you for an eternity. I am very pateint,
simply because I know what you add and mean to my life, though it is hard not
seeing you, I know that if you could you would, but that does not stop me
from wanting you in my arms and presence.

Hey Joe!  Fat Chance about you being kicked off the anniversary committee 
cause if you go, I GO!  

Not very many people showed up for the meeting.  Grace, Pastor, Kevin, 
Carolyn, Mother Jackson and I were there. Not a whole lot of decisions were 
made;  mostly we just gave Grace an update on what we discussed last 
Wednesday.  

"DON'T QUOTE ME"
Mass mailing to all churches is our area as well as some selected churches 
outside our area  such as Windsor Village, Mount Vernon, St. Agnes, Abundant 
Life, Good Hope, Lakewood and Memorial. Target date: Nov. 15th and Dec. 1 cut 
off

Curtis spoke to Shaun McLemore yesterday?.  He said something about having 
nice and lengthy conversation with him regarding some CD.  Like I said "DON'T 
QUOTE ME"   but Shaun was OK with it as long as there would be no 
reproduction of it to make a profit.  That's all I can remember now.  I'll 
see you tonight at choir rehearsal.

Dana,

Thanks for sending me your resume.  There's a possibility something might be 
available in our group within the next few months.  If I hear of any open 
positions within any of the other EBS groups, I'll forward you resume.

Good luck and stay in touch.

 I got a page from Evelyn M.  She said that Jackie Stewarts mother is in the
hospital with a growth on her pancreas and her baby Jarred is in the hospital
with with pneumonia.

We are standing for full healing for Jarred and no sickness or pathology for 
her
mother -- and for the Spirit of God to lead and guide Jackie and her family.

We will all stand on the promise of 1 Peter 2: 24  "Whoe his own self bare our
sins in his own body on the tree , that we, being dead to sins, should live 
unto
righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed."

Love,
J.

There will be 3 vans downstairs on Thursday, Dec. 14 that will be 
transporting sponsors every 15-20 minutes starting at 10am.  We should try to 
be there at least 30 minues before our 1st break (11:39), so let's try to 
leave around 11am-ish?  

Nicole

>   Here is a true story about a nine-year-old boy who lived in a rural town
>   in Tennessee.  His house was in a poor area of the community.  A church
>   had a bus ministry that came knocking on his door one Saturday
afternoon.
>
>   The kid came to answer the door and greeted the bus pastor. The bus
pastor
>   asked if his parents were home and the small boy told him that his
parents
>   take off every weekend and leave him at home to take care of his little
>   brother.
>
>   The bus pastor couldn't believe what the kid said and asked him to
repeat
>  it.
>   The youngster gave the same answer and the bus pastor asked to come in
and
>   talk with him.   They went into the living room and sat down on an old
>  couch
>   with the foam and springs exposed.
>
>   The bus pastor asked the kid, "Where do you go to church?"
>
>   The young boy surprised the visitor by replying, "I've never been to
church
>
>   in my whole life."
>
>   The bus pastor thought to himself about the fact that his church was
less
>   than three miles from the child's house.  "Are you sure you have never
>   been to church?" he asked again.
>
>   "I sure haven't", came his answer.
>
>   Then the bus pastor said, "Well, son, more important than going to
>   church, have you ever heard the greatest love story ever told? "And then
he
>
>   proceeded to share the Gospel with this little nine-year-old boy.
>
>   The young lad's heart began to be tenderized and at the end of the bus
>  pastor's
>   story the bus pastor asked if the boy wanted to receive this free gift
from
>  God.
>   The youngster exclaimed, "You Bet!
>
>   The kid and the bus pastor got on their knees and the lad invited Jesus
>  into
>   his little heart and received the free gift of salvation.   They both
stood
>  up
>   and the bus pastor asked if he could pick the kid up for church the next
>  morning.
>
>   Sure," the nine year old replied.
>
>   The bus pastor got to the house early the next morning and found the
lights
>  off.
>   He let himself in and snaked his way through the house and found the
little
>  boy
>   asleep in his bed.  He woke up the little boy and his brother and helped
>  get them
>   dressed.  They got on the bus and ate a donut for breakfast on their way
to
>  church.
>   Keep in mind that this boy had never been to church before.   The church
>  was a real
>   big one.   The little kid just sat there, clueless of what was going on.

>
>   A few minutes into the service these tall unhappy guys walked down to
the
>  front
>   and picked up some wooden plates.  One of the men prayed and the kid
with
>  utter
>   fascination watched them walk up and down the aisles. He still didn't
know
>  what
>   was going on.
>
>   All of a sudden like a bolt of lightning it hit the kid what was taking
>  place.
>   These people must be giving money to Jesus.  He then reflected on the
free
>  gift
>   of life he had received just twenty-four hours earlier.  He immediately
>  searched
>   his pockets, front and back, and couldn't find a thing to give Jesus.
>
>   By this time the offering plate was being passed down his aisle and with
a
>  broken
>   heart he just grabbed the plate and held on to it.   He finally let go
and
>  watched
>   it pass on down the aisle.  He turned around to see it passed down the
>  aisle
>   behind him.   And then his eyes remained glued on the plate as it was
>  passed
>   back and forth, back and forth all the way to the rear of the sanctuary.
>
>   Then he had an idea. This little nine-year-old boy, in front of God and
>  everybody,
>   got up out of his seat.  He walked about eight rows back, grabbed the
usher
>  by the
>   coat and asked to  hold the plate one more time.  Then he did the most
>  astounding
>   thing I have ever heard of.
>
>   He took the plate, sat it on the carpeted church floor and stepped into
the
>  center
>   of it.   As he stood there, he lifted his little head up and said,
"Jesus,
>  I don't
>   have anything to give you today, but just me.  I give you me!"

Everything is fine.  And it's not just you that I'm saying this to.
My supervisor made a big deal about me leaving early  (at 4pm) on Friday
for Candis' Party.  When I walked into her office and reminded her that on
Wednesday  I had asked to get off an hour early  she had just barely
acknowledged that I was even in the room;  but before she could finish
hearing me out good, she spun around in her chair and said "What time did
you come in this morning"?  Well the rest was history.  After about 4
minutes she had to get up and shut the door because every comment that was
made brought an even louder response.  Needless to say I was LIVID by the
time I left out of there wan hour later )

Yes you told me that you saw us.  I blew up on someone (my boss).  I'm not

I can say this....2 changes will be taking place because of this.
1. I'm changing my hours for 8:30 to 5:30   TO  8:00 to 5:00
2. I'm only going to communicate with you through e-mail

If you need something that's urgent,  you can leave me a message and I will
respond via email or go to another phone and call you.  (Yes , it's that

The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe=
w=20
years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increa=
se=20
in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have=20
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20
employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times=
=20
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=
e=20
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, =
we=20
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa=
ry=20
for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and=
=20
other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay=
=20
for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc=
tions=20
are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through=20
employee expense reports.=20

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce=
=20
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of=
=20
checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and th=
e=20
turnaround time for payment of invoices. =20

Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide=20
web-based expense reporting system similar to what Enron International has=
=20
used for the past year.  This will make it even easier to file your expense=
=20
report and receive quick reimbursement.

We=01,d like to make this effective immediately.  If you have any questions=
 or=20
suggestions, please contact the Accounts Payable department.

       Fruits Of The Spirit
        Max Lucado)

       It's quiet. It's early. My coffee is hot. The sky is still black. The
 world is still asleep. The day is coming.

       In a few moments the day will arrive. It will roar down the track with
 the rising of the sun. The stillness of the dawn will be exchanged for the
 noise of the day. The calm of the solitude will be replaced by the pounding
 pace of the human race. The refuge of the early morning will be invaded by
 decisions to be made and deadlines to be met.

       For the next twelve hours I will be exposed to the day's demands. It
 is now that I must make a choice. Because of Calvary, I'm free to choose.
 And so I choose.

       I choose love... No occasion justifies hatred; no injustice warrants
 bitterness, I choose love. Today I will love God and what God loves.

       I choose joy... I will invite my God to be the God of circumstance. I
 will refuse the temptation to be cynical...the tool of the lazy thinker. I
 will refuse to see people as anything less than human beings, created by
 God. I will refuse to see any problem as anything less than an opportunity
 to see God.

       I choose peace... I will live forgiven. I will forgive so that I may
 live.

       I choose patience... I will overlook the inconveniences of the world.
 Instead of cursing the one who takes my place, I'll invite him to do so.
 Rather than complaining that the wait is too long, I will thank God for a
 moment to pray. Instead of clinching my fist at new assignments, I will face
 them with joy and courage.

       I choose kindness... I will be kind to the poor, for they are alone.
 Kind to the rich, for they are afraid. And kind to the unkind, for such is
 how God has treated me.

       I choose goodness... I will go without a dollar before I take a
 dishonest one. I will be overlooked before I will boast. I will confess
 before I will accuse. I choose goodness.

       I choose faithfulness... Today I will keep my promises. My debtors
 will not regret their trust. My associates will not question my word. My
 wife will not question my love. And my children will never fear that their
 father will not come home.

       I choose gentleness... Nothing is won by force. I choose to be gentle.
 If I raise my voice may it be only in praise. If I clench my fist, may it be
 only in prayer. If I make a demand, may it be only of myself.

       I choose self-control... I am a spiritual being. After this body is
 dead, my spirit will soar. I refuse to let what will rot, rule the eternal.
 I choose self-control. I will be drunk only by joy. I will be impassioned
 only by my faith. I will be influenced only by God. I will be taught only by
 Christ. I choose self-control.

       Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
 gentleness, and self-control. To these I commit my day. If I succeed, I will
 give thanks. If I fail, I will seek His grace. And then when this day is
 done, I will place my head on my pillow and rest. >>

Some of the accountants have been able to flag a few items that can be 
archived but it has only been a very little.  Most of them are asking the 
same question.  They want to know if there will be file cabinet space to 
store the items that they are  not ready to send to archive but have no room 
to store on their desks?  This is placing a hold on the archiving project 
because I can't archive anything that the accountants won't give me the go 
ahead on and quite frankly,  this is nearly everything I touch.  Please 
help.  Maybe if they knew where their things were going to be stored,  I 
could at least help box it up for them to move with them.  Thanks.

very valuable and wanted to tell you about this unique FREE service!

Point your browser to the following web address, take the Spiritual Gifts
Analysis Test, and within minutes you'll know your dominant spiritual
gift and what you can do with it to minister to others. Here's the address:

http://www.teamministry.com/

I do hope you'll take advantage of this unique opportunity to learn about
yourself and how the Lord has gifted you!

Sincerely,

Larry Gilbert

PS: Here's what your friend wanted to say to you:

Dana, Here is another inventory that I have taken in the past.
It's a very good one. Let me know what you think. BA

Hey:

We get these newsletters in our apartments every month and there is
always a
brain teaser on the back side of it.  This was the one for this month:

Let's see how well you will do.

For every question, tell me who this person is, not their names, but
their
relationship to you. (eg. cousin, aunt, great-grandma, etc.)


1.  Who is your father's, uncle's, brother's sister?

2.  Who is your aunt's mother's, father's, wife?

3.  Who is your mother's, nephew's, daughter's son?

4.  Who is your brother's, son's, sister's mother?

5.  Who is your sister-in-law's, father-in-law's grandson?

6.  Who is your sister's, father's, step-son's mother?

7.  Who is your uncle's, father's, grandchild?

Make an honest attempt, and then scroll down for the answers...

Claudette, Dana & Carolyn,

    Sending this e-mail to remind you of the revival at Shaw Tabernacle UMC
on Friday at 7:30 pm.  The directions are 45S or 59S to 610E.  601E to
Wayside.  Exit Wayside and turn left under 610.   Take Wayside to Birmingham
and turn right on Birmingham.  Birmingham dead ends into the church.  Try
and be there on time, because the church fills up pretty quickly.

    Also remember the Seeds of Praise workshop on Saturday from 9:00 am to
2:00 pm at Mt. Corinth UMC in Humble. Take 1960 towards Humble.  Take the
"Y" in the road when going into Humble onto Old Humble Road.  The church is
about 1 to 1 1/2 miles down on the right.  If you pass Super K-Mart on the
left, turn around you have gone to far.  Breakfast will be served promptly
at 9:00 am.  I have already paid for all members going from Veterans, so we
can settle up later.

    Don't forget the picnic is on Sunday after service.  If you haven't
signed up to bring anything contact Danise Johnson to see what is still
needed.

    If you need any other info, please contact me:  (281)872-1197 Home

(713)696-6878 Work

(832)567-8674 Cell

Be Blessed,

All,

      Here is the information on the blue jean shirts.  The exact price is
as follows:

M - XL         $22.65
XXL             $23.90
XXXL           $25.15

Please turn in your money to me as soon as possible.  The total for all the
shirts we have ordered is $551.  I have already made arrangements to pay for
half up front, due to such a high dollar order.

Pass the word on to those not on e-mail (Evelyn Morris, Evelyn Jackson, Nina
Nazir-ud-Din, Pamela Watts, Annette Richardson, Georgia Gillum, Danise
Johnson, Jackie Stewart, Marylyn Green, Ethel Ford, Cheryl Sumbler, and
Cheryl Curry). We need to try and have the money by Powertime on Wednesday.
If you need an accomodation, please let me know.

If you know of anyone else wanting a shirt, please get with me as soon as
possible.  I thought maybe the following might want a shirt (Rev Jacque,
Bobbie Poledore, Katherine Dailey, Valerie Piper).  It would be nice if all
women had one.

Also, thank Joe Stewart when you see him, for making all the arrangements
for us.

Thanks,
Denise

We will adopt your suggestion and fast on Wednesday mornings form 8 to 12,
so that we all are on one accord, that way we're all praying at the same
time and fasting at the same time. Be blessed Dana:-)

I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but what I was trying to convey was that
Rev. Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group
by-way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up
the concerns that was given to us in the hand-outs and also anything else
that God lays on our heart.

The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque
mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that
we could be on one accord. I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us
is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not
assembled together on Monday night.

 I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on
Wednesday's, there will be some definite strongholds torn down. What do you
think?

Matthew 18:20 states "For where two or three are gathered together in My
name, I am there in the midst of them".

Greeting My Dear Sisters In Christ,

It has been suggested by our Prayer Ministry Leader that we establish a
common time for our Organized Units to pray. It seems as though Tuesday
night at 9:30 pm would be the  most convenient, at this present time.

It is my discernment that tonight should be our starting date. Please make
every attempt to comply with this endeavor in order that we may attack the
strongholds and be unified in  the body of Christ.

If this is not conducive for your schedule please suggest an alternative.

Be Blessed
Edith:-)

Davette, 
Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter 
that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at 
my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of 
our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage 
you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the 
effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly 
stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and 
we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try 
to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have 
received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, 
government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really 
don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us 
around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt 
we hurt. : )


I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

Hi Dana ,
?
I was so blessed to receive your prayer this  morning, thank you.? I'm 
forwarding the prayer back to you, knowing that  God is already blessing you 
today as he does every day.? Just the mere fact  that we were chosen to be 
prayer partners is evidence that God is at work in  ways that we don't always 
readlily see.
?
Look forward to seeing you tonight at Power Time.  May God continue to bless 
and keep you. 
?
Your sister in Christ, 
?
Love,
?
Betty

Dana, If you need help preparing for the trip please let me know.
As far as the hair thing I have to have mine done tonight for sure,
tomorrow is bible study, Thursday Chanel has a class, she'll already
miss Saturday because they will be out of town, so if you can't do it for me
let me know
believe me I understand. It's just convenient because you're right there,
plus those lil-nubs
do a wondrous job. Oh! please let me have a copy of the directions for
back-up just in case
we'll have an extra one. Please advise :>

I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.  I am trying to do the
majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am
also still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you
already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.
I am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them.

Subject: Re: Pancakes


Subject:  Pancakes

Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,
opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it
on  the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,
mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail
on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  Brandon was
covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something
very good for his Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't  know
what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove, (and
he didn't know how the stove worked)!

Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and  reached to
push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried
to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his
pajamas white and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was
coming, maybe even a spanking.

But his father just watched him. Then, walking through the mess, he picked
up his crying son, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white
and sticky in the process.

That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it
turns into a mess sometimes. Our marriage gets all sticky, or we insult a
friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we
just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.

That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some
of our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't
stop trying to "make pancakes," for God or for others.

Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...


Please pass some of this love on to others.

show.  Business Units will be charged $150 per 8 hour class for a user that 
is enrolled in a class but does not show-up.  If a user misses 1 day of a 
multiple day course, the business unit will be charged for everyday of that 
class (ex. 4 day class => 4 days *  $150 = $600).

By 8:20 am :  The door to all classrooms will be closed 20 minutes after the 
start of the scheduled training class.  At this point, stand-by users will be 
able to take a seat.  If a seat is still available, late arrivals will be 
allowed to attend but will not receive CPE credits.  This rule applies to 
participants that miss more than 20  minutes of class.

There are a considerable number of users throughout both ENA and Enron that 
are being trained over the next two months.  Please try and be respectful of 
others that are attending your class and be on time.

>From the SAP Training Team (Please read the information I have highlighted in 
RED as this is new information):

Answers to Commonly Asked Questions:
How will CPE credits be determined?  
 CPE credits will be granted according to established CPE Accreditation 
Procedures governed by our sponsor ID.  In order to receive CPE credits,   
participants must:
Sign the attendance sheet for everyday of a given class
Attend the entire class
Complete an evaluation for the class prior to leaving the classroom
 All CPE credits will be  granted at the conclusion of all SAP classes 
(approximately August 30th).

What is the attendance policy for training?
 In an effort to be supportive, we are trying to be accommodating this week 
in regards to attendance.  We do recognize that people's schedules change  
and emergencies happen.  However, it is our responsibility to make sure that 
all participants who are attending class receive the best possible 
training.   Therefore, the following guidelines will be followed: 
Business Units will be charged $150 per 8 hour class for a user that is 
enrolled in a class but does not show-up.  If a user misses 1 day of a 
multiple day course, the business unit will be charged for everyday of that 
class (ex. 4 day class => 4 days *  $150 = $600).  In order to avoid these 
charges, users must send an email to 'Apollo and Beyond Registrar'  stating 
their need to cancel before  the beginning of the training class.  Emails 
received after the beginning of the class will be considered no-shows.
Users that are not enrolled in classes but choose to show-up may attend on a 
stand-by basis.  This means that if there are open seats available then 
stand-by users may attend.  However, if no seat is available or a registered 
user shows-up within the allotted 20 minute window, the stand-by user will 
not be allowed to participate in the class.
The door to all classrooms will be closed 20 minutes after the start of the 
scheduled training class.  At this point, stand-by users will be able to take 
a seat.  If a seat is still available, late arrivals will be allowed to 
attend but will not receive CPE credits.  This rule applies to participants 
that miss more than 20  minutes of class.

To All DSS Users,

Currently there is no mechanism for changing your password on DSS.  

On May 15, 2000, we will be putting a new procedure into effect that will 
function similarly to the LAN change password procedure.  Passwords for DSS 
users will begin to expire in early June, and every 60 days thereafter.  You 
will be receiving 5 Password Expiration e-mails as the deadline approaches.  
Each of these messages will notify you that your DSS password will expire in 
the specified time interval.

These e-mails will be sent as follows:
E-mail  #1 - 2 weeks before expiration date
 #2 - 1 week before expiration date
 #3 - 2 days before expiration date
 #4 - 1 day before expiration date
 #5 - The day the password expires

We now have a new module that will allow you to change your password.  When 
this module is executed, a window will display which will prompt you for your 
current password, New password, and repeat New password.  There are certain 
criteria that the new password must meet for it to successfully change.  
Follow the instructions on this window to choose a new password.  You may run 
this module anytime, but once you change your password, the module must be 
closed before it can be run again.

Please Detach (double-click) the following module and save it in the location 
that you normally save your DSS modules/databases.  This may be on your hard 
(C:) drive or personal (H:) drive.  As long as you remember where it is, it 
really doesn't matter where you save it.  When the time comes, Execute 
(double-click) the module to change your DSS password.





If you have any questions or problems, please call the DSS HelpDesk at 
x31555, option 6 OR Lotus Notes e-mail at GPG DSS.

Thank you.

Okay, folks, let's put our mouth where our money is . . .  I am not sure
about the rest of you, but I feel like my family single-handedly keeps
Wal-Mart in business!   This is truly a courageous company and they
deserve our very vocal support at this time.  - Sandy Zeek

awww mannnn!!!!!
It seemed like a lot of stuff hit the fan on Friday. Not only there, but
here also.  It didn't hit me initially, but I got caught in some of the
backlash. I hope that your job is NOT in jeopardy. As for the changes. I can
go along with one of them. Guess which. The 8 - 5pm. I'll definitely be
changing to get off at 5pm or earlier. Oh watch your ego.  Its not all you.
I got a letter from Brian's Football team.  They have an equipment check
Saturday July 29 and practice starts that Monday at 6pm.  Being an Assistant
Coach, you know the drill.
As for this other nonsense about phone call/e-mail. If it ain't bad enough
that things.............Oh well. Do you feel me? #@$%*&*# Anyway, not
knowing the full extent what and why it happened (Your Blow Up) and my ever
evolving situation with a new twist.

I think I've said enough for now.

Yes you told me that you saw us.  I blew up on someone (my boss).  I'm not
ready to talk about it  yet because it causes me to vividly relive the
whole thing and I'm just not ready to revisit that situation yet.  Although
I can say this....2 changes will be taking place because of this.
1. I'm changing my hours for 8:30 to 5:30   TO  8:00 to 5:00
2. I'm only going to communicate with you through e-mail

If you need something that's urgent,  you can leave me a message and I will
respond via email or go to another phone and call you.  (Yes , it's that
serious)
Anyway - not the end of the world just FYI.

Good morning to you also. My weekend was very quiet. You would have been
proud of me. ??????? I would have preferred it a different way. Oh well.
The
explosion in question, is that the one at the refinery? Or is it another
one
regarding you blowing up on somebody.  Oh yes did I say that I saw you and
Kandace on Friday nite around 6:30pm. Sorry I didn't drive today. Funny I
checked my voice mail most of the weekend, the moment I didn't check I get
a
call.

Good Morning My Sisters In Christ,

I am writing you on behalf of a bridal shower that my sister wants to give me
on Dec. 2nd at 6:30 pm. I want to extend an invitation to all of you who are
interested in coming. For those of you that would be interested, I will need
your address forwarded to Kathy (my sister) and copy me. Her email address is
 kathy-lacy@reliantenergy.com and you can copy me here to my my home email
address. I would also appreciate it if you would get the word out to others
that do not have email and to others that might be interested in coming. I
was asked to get this information 2 weeks ago but I have been on the run so
please forgive me for this late hour if you please. Thank you in advance for
your response.

Edith:-)

light, this is Ridgecreek Dr. - I think it is W. Ridgecreek, may be E. 
Ridgecreek, make a left (good markers are an auto parts store, Little Ceasars 
Pizza and a Food Arama Food store shopping center.  Go to second stop sign 
which is Ridgestone St., make a left.   Continue on this street to the second 
stop sign, this is East Ridgecreek Dr., make a left.  Continue on this 
street, you will go over a little bridge; at first stop sign this is still 
East Ridgecreek, make a right.  From here all the streets are East Ridgecreek 
Dr. which are divided by blocks, you want to go to the third street, make a 
left.  My house is the second house on the right, 4859 East Ridgecreek Dr.  
If you have problems call me on my cell phone 832-493-2699.  See you there! !

Your Sister in Christ our Lord

Dana,

Thank you for the encouragement.  I know God is working and He is taking us
to higher heights in Him.  I am excited about how He is transforming me in
all of this.  I am not perfect, still have many faults, but I glad He loves
me in spite of myself.

XOXOX
Bonnie

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)
Edith

Subject: ACT: New DSS Change Password Procedure  



To All DSS Users,

Currently there is no mechanism for changing your password on DSS.  

On May 15, 2000, we will be putting a new procedure into effect that will 
function similarly to the LAN change password procedure.  Passwords for DSS 
users will begin to expire in early June, and every 60 days thereafter.  You 
will be receiving 5 Password Expiration e-mails as the deadline approaches.  
Each of these messages will notify you that your DSS password will expire in 
the specified time interval.

These e-mails will be sent as follows:
E-mail  #1 - 2 weeks before expiration date
 #2 - 1 week before expiration date
 #3 - 2 days before expiration date
 #4 - 1 day before expiration date
 #5 - The day the password expires

We now have a new module that will allow you to change your password.  When 
this module is executed, a window will display which will prompt you for your 
current password, New password, and repeat New password.  There are certain 
criteria that the new password must meet for it to successfully change.  
Follow the instructions on this window to choose a new password.  You may run 
this module anytime, but once you change your password, the module must be 
closed before it can be run again.

Please Detach (double-click) the following module and save it in the location 
that you normally save your DSS modules/databases.  This may be on your hard 
(C:) drive or personal (H:) drive.  As long as you remember where it is, it 
really doesn't matter where you save it.  When the time comes, Execute 
(double-click) the module to change your DSS password.





If you have any questions or problems, please call the DSS HelpDesk at 
x31555, option 6 OR Lotus Notes e-mail at GPG DSS.

Thank you.

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

Good My Love,

    It is always a pleasure hearing from you. It is ironic that you e-mailed
me, I was on the computer and Aunt Pat asked me am I talking to you, and just
as her words came out, the computer chimed in and said you got mail. I check
it and low and behold there you were, My grandma Klumps Renee Davis.
     I got your e-mail Saturday and I ironed out the error in my web site,
therefore you can e-mail me at CHARLES200064@aol.com.
    I am going to place you on my buddy list so we can chat online. Write me
back when you get this message.

Good Morning Miss Dana!

You are so fresssssssssssssssssh!  It does feel good to be in a perfect
relationship.  You know there is a Scripture which talks about returning to 
your
first love -Jesus.   I stand on it  often but can't remember it's location in
the Gospel.  There is another which speaks to the smell and aroma of Jesus
Christ.  That's awesome too.

Have a blessed day.  Your joy gives me a boost.  Receive God's special 
goodness
for your life.

Love Ya'
Jacqueline Gayle

This is in Publisher 2000, see if you can open it in anything.  It needs

Subject: Reporting Workshops

The SAP Reporting Team is currently scheduling Reporting Workshops for August 
and September.  These will be very focused, hands on, sessions from 1-4 hours 
long with around 5 people per session.   There is one overview class, Design 
& Data Flow, which will not be hands on but which will give you an overview 
of how data flows in the systems.   Each class will focus on how to pull 
reports within the specific module listed and how to use the standard SAP 
reporting tools.

Please review the list of classes below and provide me with a list of 
individuals that you would like to attend each type of session and your first 
and second choose of sessions.  It will work better if we can fill an entire 
class with people from either the same group or that perform the same 
function.  This will help keep the classes focused.  Please provide an 
initial list to me by noon Monday July 31st.

I will be out of the office on Thurs. and Friday July 27-28.  I my absence 
please feel free to call Kim Lesley at 5-77713.  She will be happy to answer 
any questions you may have.

Good Morning Dana,

Needless to say, I wasn't here on that Thursday when you were trying to
contact me. I do hope that things worked out with them getting in touch
with each other. That day was a very busy day to say the least, but now
it's back to reality.

But for future references, if I can not be reached here at work or home and
there's a need to contact the Pastor, I can be paged 2 ways. A text message
can be sent by email stating your case with a very brief message and the
address you would need to use would be 7136066605@MOBCOMINET.

If you need to page me with just a phone number, I can be reached at
713-606-6605. So next time, please feel free to use the information listed
above. Be blessed on today and Happy Holiday's to you and yours.

Edith:-)

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but what I was trying to convey was that
Rev. Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group
by-way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up
the concerns that was given to us in the hand-outs and also anything else
that God lays on our heart.

The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque
mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that
we could be on one accord. I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us
is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not
assembled together on Monday night.

 I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on
Wednesday's, there will be some definite strongholds torn down. What do you
think?

Matthew 18:20 states "For where two or three are gathered together in My
name, I am there in the midst of them".

Greeting My Dear Sisters In Christ,

It has been suggested by our Prayer Ministry Leader that we establish a
common time for our Organized Units to pray. It seems as though Tuesday
night at 9:30 pm would be the  most convenient, at this present time.

It is my discernment that tonight should be our starting date. Please make
every attempt to comply with this endeavor in order that we may attack the
strongholds and be unified in  the body of Christ.

If this is not conducive for your schedule please suggest an alternative.

Be Blessed
Edith:-)

Per Stacy Aune concerning this issue, her understanding is that a manual 
entry will be kicked out unless a cost center is entered for applicable 
accounts.  If you have entries to accounts 60000000-79999999 you should 
replace the profit center with a cost center for entries with a posting date 
on or after 11/1/00.  Most profit centers have one or more related cost 
centers assigned to them per the Standard Hierarchy Report but some do not.  
If your chosen profit center does not have a related cost center let me 
know.    

Keep in mind that this is only for accts. 60000000-79999999 and most of those 
accounts are not used by our group.  However, we do use some of the accounts 
such as 62000000 Interest Income - Third Party, among others.  

Cost Centers are only needed for these accounts for entries with a posting 
date of 11/1/00 or later.  If you are doing 10/31/00 close entries, do them 
the same as you have been.

Since we are in the middle of 10/00 close and this issue does not affect 
10/31/00 entries, I will remind everyone in November to review this issue for 
their entries.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin,
 Can you please coordinate this by Friday, November 10th.  We should have 
profit centers set up for all of our companies, but I am not sure about cost 
centers.  Please refer to the Standard Hierarchy Report.   Let me know if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: Spreadsheet for Review - New Cost Elements (60000000-79999999)

As most of you may already know, beginning November 1st  (Sorry, we got this 
Friday afternoon!), the 60000000-79999999 range of accounts will now require 
a cost center instead of a profit center when using those accounts.  Some of 
the accounts that this range includes is Interest Income/Expense, Gain/Loss 
on Foreign Currency, and Gain/Losses on Disposition of Assets.

Unfortunately, the processes that are run automatically by the ISC that 
eventually book to these accounts, will hit a default cost center on each 
company if one is not specified.  This is very similar to the derivation 
pooling profit center 12951.  The ISC is giving us the opportunity to specify 
by company/account what the default cost center should be for each account.

Please review the attached spreadsheet below.  It contains a row for each 
company and shows the default cost center the ISC has chosen for each account.
 

Please respond back to me with the following:

1)  Confirmation that you have reviewed and agree with the cost center that 
has been chosen for each account on your company

    -OR-

2)  An attachment with the changes you desire the ISC to make with regards to 
your default cost center by account

These changes will affect any posting date of November 1st or later.  For 
those of you who have FX revalution on your companies, this change will have 
an effect in October close when the FX program is run after the last workday.

I need a response from those companies with FX revalution ASAP.

For the remainder of the companies, I would like a response by Friday, 
November 10th.

Thanks for your efforts in advance and sorry for the short notice,

Stacey

Subject: Spreadsheet for Review - New Cost Elements (60000000-79999999)

I promise this is the last note about this today.

The attached spreadsheet has all the default cost centers we have loaded in 
the system for the accounts listed below.  We  have made an initial attempt 
to do this for you.    It is not required to use the same default cost center 
for each of these accounts on a company code.  Previously when these defaults 
were assigned at the profit center level, you were only allowed one default 
profit center for a company code.  We are not encouraging multiple default 
cost centers for these accounts, but we just want to offer the flexibility.

Please review the attached file, and forward me any changes you would like 
made.  You may only need to review the fields in yellow & green.  I have 
already sent you a note regarding the "No CC" fields that are in red.   We 
are only entering the default cost centers for the accounts that had activity 
on your company codes in year 2000.  That is why there are a lot of empty 
fields you do not have to worry about.   We will continue to add and modify 
the cost center defaults on an as needed basis.

Use this information to help you analyze the spreadsheet:
Accounts in black The accounts in black were already cost elements and 
already had the default cost centers assigned.  
Accounts in blue- The accounts in blue are the new cost elements.  If there 
was an existing default cost center for a company, we have already assigned 
it to    the new accounts in blue.  

Yellow  We selected a default cost center from the values assigned to  the 
default profit center for that company code.
Green  There was not a default profit center so we reviewed the cost centers 
on that company and selected the one we thought was most appropriate.
Red  This company code did not have any cost centers.  I have already asked 
you for these in a previous email. 



If you make changes, please move them to a spreadsheet by themselves or make 
them easy for us to identify in this spreadsheet.   Thanks again for all your 
help.  

Accounts posted to automatically by the system



* Already a cost element before this new process.

Good Morning,

      I have information on the shirts we talked about for the Seeds of
Praise conference.  Joe Stewart checked into both options we wanted.

For the polo style shirt it will be $18 to $19.50 per shirt.

For the long sleeve blue jean shirt it will be $25 - $28 per shirt.

This is based on that the Northwest Printing will provide the shirts.  Also
this will be the embroidered logo and not the iron on one.  We need to
decide quickly and get our money turned in quickly.  We only have about 2
weeks to get this done.  As we talked about, we would wear these on Sunday
for the closing worship service and then back to Veterans on Sunday.

Please either e-mail your preference or let me know at Power time tonight.
If you know of anyone who is not on line and you have a few minutes to
contact them today, please do so.  (Evelyn Jackson, Ethel Ford, Nina Nazir
Ud-Din, Pam Watts, Cheryl Sumbler, Cheryl Curry, Danise Johnson, and Evelyn
Morris)

We need to make a decision quickly and try to have the money by Sunday.
Also, if you have not finished paying your registration, it is due by
Friday, so please try and bring it tonight, otherwise you will have to catch
up with myself or Bonnie on Friday.

Thanks,
Denise

Subject: ISO-NE failure to mitigate ICAP market -- Release of ISO NE 
confidential information



The New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners (NECUPUC) filed 
an Answer if Support of the Motion of the Maine Public Utilities Commission 
for Disclosure of Information.
NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of 
ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, they 
would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to 
the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer 
subject to an appropriate protective order.



Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC 
request for public information.

DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidential 
information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services 
Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.
Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL 
markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.
If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it 
should be subject to a protective order which contains the following:
The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.
Only specifically named "reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review 
the information.
The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.
The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.


Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast 
Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited 
commission action.  NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for 
disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the 
selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory 
commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request 
expedited action due the financial implications and there is also 
considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in 
January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending 
Commission guidance.

Claudette, Dana & Carolyn,

    Sending this e-mail to remind you of the revival at Shaw Tabernacle UMC
on Friday at 7:30 pm.  The directions are 45S or 59S to 610E.  601E to
Wayside.  Exit Wayside and turn left under 610.   Take Wayside to Birmingham
and turn right on Birmingham.  Birmingham dead ends into the church.  Try
and be there on time, because the church fills up pretty quickly.

    Also remember the Seeds of Praise workshop on Saturday from 9:00 am to
2:00 pm at Mt. Corinth UMC in Humble. Take 1960 towards Humble.  Take the
"Y" in the road when going into Humble onto Old Humble Road.  The church is
about 1 to 1 1/2 miles down on the right.  If you pass Super K-Mart on the
left, turn around you have gone to far.  Breakfast will be served promptly
at 9:00 am.  I have already paid for all members going from Veterans, so we
can settle up later.

    Don't forget the picnic is on Sunday after service.  If you haven't
signed up to bring anything contact Danise Johnson to see what is still
needed.

    If you need any other info, please contact me:  (281)872-1197 Home

Subject: Question

Is it OK that I let entries take priority over those documents that you 
wanted me to hole punch and place in binders for you?  I thought I could do 
it for sure today and I still might be able too but I want to make sure that 
I don't fall behind on the entries.  Is that OK?  Oh yeah, Brad and Lisa Kang 
had me working on projects for them Friday and Monday.

Friends who Pray together, stay together. Let's pray...

Dear Lord, I thank You for this day. I Thank You for my being able to see
and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God and an
understanding God. You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing
me.

Forgive me this day for I have sinned. I ask now for Your forgiveness.
Keep me safe from all danger and harm. Let me start this day with a new
attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best of each and every
day and give my best in all that is put before me.

Clear my mind that I can hear from You. Broaden my mind that I can accept
all things. Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over.

Let me continue to see sin through Your eyes and acknowledge it as evil.
And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing, and
receive the forgiveness of God and sin no more.

And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example - to
slipaway and find a quiet place to pray. It's the best response when I'm
pushed
beyond my limits. I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart.
Continue to use me to do Thy Will. Continue to bless me that I may be a
blessing to others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak and unsaved.

Keep me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for others. pray
for those who are lost and can't find their way. I pray for those who are
misjudged and misunderstood. I pray for those who refuse to share a word
from You. I pray for those who don't know You intimately.
I pray for those who will only read this and not speak this aloud in their
own lives. I pray for those who will delete this without sharing it with
others. I pray for those who don't believe. But, I thank you that I believe.

I believe that God changes people and God changes things.
I pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each and every family member
in their households. I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes, that
they are out of debt and all their needs are met. There are no
circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is in His hands
for Him to fight. I pray that these words be received into the hearts of
every eye that sees them and every mouth that confesses them willingly.

This is my prayer. In Jesus Name, Amen.

I went to see Dorothy, Tim and the new baby on Sunday.  He is absolutely 
beautiful and Dorothy and Tim couldn't be prouder parents.  His name 
is.....Drake Andrew Dalton and that name suits him just fine!  Thanks.

It's getting to be that time of the year again.

You've guessed it!  Mid Year PRC is around the corner and we must start 
preparing for it.  

In preparation for the upcoming Mid Year Review Process, we will need your 
assistance with the Communication to your groups!  Therefore, we, the Human 
Resources Team for ENA, are requesting your assistance in generating all the 
communication materials needed to your group to make sure we don't leave 
anyone uninformed.   The first two pieces of communication coming your way, 
besides  the e-mail announcements that have recently been distributed, is the 
ever so famous Quick Reference Guides & the new PEP cards.  This time around, 
the Global Performance Mgmt team has decided not to have so many hard copies 
distributed  of the Quick Reference Guides because you are receiving the 
e-mail version copy, as you will find attached below.  The reason behind this 
is that ENA has been through this process for the last few years and the 
Quick Reference Guides contain alot of the same information as in the past, 
and seem to come in much more handy for employees tha are new to the company 
and to the process.

Next, the Global Perf Mgmt team has created this nifty PEP Card that has very 
minimal highlighted information for everyone. 
Please anticipate the PEP Cards in your group this Friday afteroon.  We will 
also get out a few hard Copies of the Reference Guides, but again, it is 
attached below, so please don't anticipate a copy of the Quick Reference 
Guides for everyone in your group.  

We will be sending a follow up e-mail to you all to advise you of the 
schedule for any training classes that will be available before the 
Performance Mgmt system opens on May 15th. 

We ask that you assist us in this process by distributing detailed e-mails 
such as this (addressed to all the Admn Asst's) to your group.  Your 
assistance and cooperation is critical, but most importantly greatly 
appreciated.

Please feel free to contact your HR rep with any questions you may have, and 
also, the PEP Hotline is already currently available to provide all employees 
with Perf Mgmt Assistance.



Thanks again.

Irma Alvarez

As you probably know by now, Enron recently entered into a new relationship
with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group to manage and administer its
temporary staffing program. This new arrangement is designed to improve
service and quality as well as increase efficiency in meeting Enron's
temporary employment needs. There are many benefits, including a web-based
application which will provide Enron's temporary staffing users with online
ordering, approval and reporting. More details on this system will be coming
soon.

In order to help the Managed Services Group serve you better in the days
ahead, please take a moment now to fill out the profile questions below and
forward your reply to Joseph Marsh at Joseph Marsh/NA/Enron. This
information will not be used for solicitation, but rather to facilitate a
more efficient ordering process.

Phase I of the program, which starts January 2, 2001,  encompasses all
administrative/clerical temporary employees in the Houston area.  Please
note that we anticipate no changes for temporary employees currently on
assignment at Enron as we make this transition.  Again, more details on the
Managed Services program and processes will be distributed in the coming
weeks.

As of January 2, the Managed Services account team will be on-site to answer
any questions and handle your temporary employee needs.  They will be
available via e-mail or by calling 713-345-6899.  Please note that the
current process for requesting temporary employees will remain in effect
through the end of the year.

Thank you,
The Enron Corp Implementation Team

I give all void requests to Claudette Danials.  She enters all voids and stop 
payments for the AP department now.  We cannot void MSA checks in SAP.  What 
we do is a journal entry to reverse the original expense (converted to SAP 
coding) and outstanding checks.  Lupe and the Wire Team do enter their own 
voids when it is a wire, but since this one was a check, Claudette should 
have it.  I do remember seeing the Goldman Sachs void request and I discussed 
it with Lien Nguyen on our wire team before she gave it to Claudette.

Ben,

As per a voicemail I left you today, one of the Enron Global Markets Teams 
(Global Risk Markets) is awaiting the reversal of a check (to Goldman Sachs) 
that was wired out instead.  Kortney Brown and Dana Davis had worked with you 
and Lupy Spencer on this before.  Last anyone heard, it had made it to your 
desk.

I was checking to see if that was the case and if there would be any 
difficulty in voiding a legacy MSA check on the new SAP system.  Please let 
me know what you find or if you need any further information.


Stephen

Hey:

We get these newsletters in our apartments every month and there is
always a
brain teaser on the back side of it.  This was the one for this month:

Let's see how well you will do.

For every question, tell me who this person is, not their names, but
their
relationship to you. (eg. cousin, aunt, great-grandma, etc.)


1.  Who is your father's, uncle's, brother's sister?

2.  Who is your aunt's mother's, father's, wife?

3.  Who is your mother's, nephew's, daughter's son?

4.  Who is your brother's, son's, sister's mother?

5.  Who is your sister-in-law's, father-in-law's grandson?

6.  Who is your sister's, father's, step-son's mother?

7.  Who is your uncle's, father's, grandchild?

Make an honest attempt, and then scroll down for the answers...

Marnie,

How do you want to handle the review of companies 28C and 46L since I'm not 
in the Houston office?  If you would like, I can get someone here to review 
them.

Hi All,

Attached is the 3Q E-Schedule Responsibility List.  There have been a few 
changes from 2Q due to new companies and staffing changes, so please review 
the attached list carefully.  If you have any questions or concerns, please 
let me know.

As a reminder, please have these completed schedules to me by Friday 
morning.  Obviously the earlier I get them, the better off I am, so if you 
can get them to me earlier than that, I would appreciate it.




Thanks,
Marnie

Good Morning Marnie -

Yesterday I made a dental appt. for Monday, Dec. 11th @ 5pm but I need to 
leave at 4pm to get there on time.  I have to finish a root canal that was 
started several months ago.  Do you foresee a problem with me leaving at 4pm 
that day?

Subject: FWD: Fw: cuckoo clock

The other night I was invited out for a night with the "boys".  I told my
wife that i would be home by midnight...promise!  Well, the hours passed and
the beer was going down way too easy.  At around 3 A.M., drunk as a skunk, I
headed home.  Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hall
started up, and cuckooed 3 times.  Quickly, I realized she'd probably wake
up, so I cuckooed another 9 times.  I was really proud of myself, having a
quick, witty solution, even when smashed, to escape a possible conflict.
Next morning my wife asked me what time I got in and I told her 12 o'clock.
She didn't seem disturbed at all.  Whew!  Got away with that one!  She then
told me that we needed a new cuckoo clock.  When I asked her why she said
"Well, it cuckooed 3 times, then said "oh fuck", cuckooed 4 more times,
cleared it's throat, cuckooed another 3 times, giggled, cuckooed twice more,
and then farted.

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a "Workflow" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Rosemary,
Dana Davis is sending the original wires back to you to enter into the A/P 
system for the month of January.  The wires have been sent out to Southwest 
Bank of Texas so you will only be entering this information into the A/P 
system but NO WIRES SHOULD BE SENT.

Please code (Debit) these 3 wires to 30016000, Profit Center 12854 (as marked 
on the wire request).  

Should you have any questions or problems, please call me at 853-5961.

Thanks,
Tammy

only way to booked for Dec  is to do it yourself by Journal Entry.  Dana has 
the wires it was sent back with her

Rosemary,

This needs to be entered in December 2000 in A/P.    Is it too late?  I sent 
the addresses on 1/2 and I heard A/P was still open for December on that 
date.  Yes, it will mess us up if you enter this is January.  What are the 
options?

Here are the addresses you needed for three wires processed in December that 
you faxed to Dana last week.  These are December payables, so they need to  
be entered for December business.   Let me know if you need any more 
information from me.

Dana & Claudette,

     Would you two be willing to co-host the November women's meeting?
Check your calendars to see if 11/18/00 is available about 5:00 pm.  Please
let me know.  We are trying to finish out our calendar year.  Prayer on it
and over it.

     Don't forget the meeting tonight at 6:00 pm at the church, prior to the
MOP meeting.

Denise

Subject:  THE VALUE OF MONEY...


Money can buy a house, but not a home.
Money can buy a bed, but not sleep.
Money can buy a clock, but not time.
Money can buy a book, but not knowledge.
Money can buy food, but not an appetite.
Money can buy position, but not respect.
Money can buy blood, but not life.
Money can buy medicine, but not health.
Money can buy sex, but not love.
Money can buy insurance, but not safety.
You see, money is not everything.

"When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles'
hands, he offered them money and said, "Give me also this ability so that
everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."  Peter
answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could
buy the gift of God with money!  You have no part or share in this
ministry, because your heart is not right before God."
Acts 8:18-21 NIV

This year we will be having our Christmas Dinner at the Cadillac Bar & 
Grill.  We have reserved the back room for our group.  Everyone will need to 
provide their own transportation because........ we aren't coming back to 
work that day!  We should try to leave around 2:00pm to be there by 2:30pm.  
We will also be having a "White Elephant" gift exchange.  If you choose to 
buy a present, $10.00 is the limit you should spend or you can bring an item 
from home, just make sure that the items are gift-wrapped.  For those that 
have never participated in a "White Elephant" gift exchange, I will be 
forwarding the rules on Monday.  I also have a copy of the menu at my desk if 
anyone would like to see it.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Nicole

Hey, Dana - 

I hope your Friday is going well.  When you have a chance on Tuesday, can you 
tell me if these have come across your desk yet?  I think the $460k was wired 
on Wed, 2/14.

Thanks for your help.  Have a nice holiday weekend!

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)
Edith

This is a great story so I hope you'll take the time to read it when you
can.
However, I disagree with the coupling it with our faith in Jesus.  My
friends it
begins with our faith in Jesus.

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

Subject: Manual JE info for cutover weekend

Attached is the template to be used for inputting manual FI and CS journal 
entries for cutover weekend.  The template will be used for both June 
Hyperion entries that were made and need to be input into SAP for June, as 
well as for any manual entries that didn't get into June MSA or Hyperion but 
need to be reflected in SAP for June (an example would be an intercompany 
imbalance that didn't get corrected by June in Hyperion).  There are some 
Hyperion entries that were made in June that shouldn't go into SAP, such as 
entries that were made to record equity earnings in consolidated subs.  These 
specific entries were made for tax reasons, but going forward, SAP will 
record these entries automatically.  If you have any questions about whether 
or not a Hyperion entry should be included in SAP, please contact me or Cindy 
Morrow.

There will be a box in Cindy Morrow's office to drop off any entries that 
need to be made.  We are requesting all manual entries converted from June 
Hyperion entries to be dropped off no later than noon on Thursday.  This will 
allow time for the SAP team to key in the entries prior to Saturday so the 
data will be in SAP when we get to work on Saturday morning.  Please include 
copies of the Hyperion entries and any other support with the SAP manual 
entries.  For any other entries that need to be made this weekend, we are 
requesting these to be dropped off as soon as possible after the Hyperion 
entries are converted and complete.

I will be available the remainder of the week to assist anyone who needs help 
converting Hyperion entries to SAP, or preparing an entry that hasn't been 
reflected in either MSA or Hyperion as of June but you would like included in 
SAP for June.  Please call me or email me to set up a time.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

=09=09Want to start living positively instead of angrily? If so, get to the=

=09=09
=09=09People who have lots of anger from childhood may find themselves unab=

=09=09
=09=09Anger CAN be controlled. Get control of your anger by learning where =

started. Then deal with your anger in a constructive way. Talk to loved=20

Since, some of you may be working late today, I am going to go ahead and just 
order some breakfast tacos for tomorrow and everyone can pitch in 
approximately $2.30?  If anyone is opposed, please let me know as soon as 
possible. 

I apologize.... somehow, it slipped by us.  What about giving her a 
traditional Birthday Breakfast tomorrow in her honor?  Please let me know 
what you would like to bring.

increasing our call center staffing to decrease your wait time.
working with the Business Unit IT departments to resolve individual browser

		Positive Living Tip of the Day
		Monday January 29, 2001
		
		Your Environment  
		
		Do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life?
		
		If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile 
environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can 
directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude.
		
		For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates 
those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects 
everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family 
members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is 
under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, 
negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes 
and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a 
reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative 
environments and begin building a positive life.

Today is a big day for ENRON!  This morning, we are rolling out the next st=
ep=20
toward empowering our most valuable resource -- you.  As of this morning,=
=20
most of you have access to the new eHRonline intranet site.

The new eHRonline functionality (a feature of the SAP implementation) is ve=
ry=20
easy to use and is accessible through the Enron intranet (at=20
http://ehronline.enron.com).  Using eHRonline, not only can you enter your=
=20
own time, but also maintain your profile, and update personal data, includi=
ng=20
home address, phone numbers, W-4 changes and emergency contact information.=
 =20
Additionally, you will be able to view your individual pay advice and benef=
it=20
elections.

Remember the deadline for time entry is 3:00 pm CST, on June 30th -- all ti=
me=20
must be submitted and ready for payroll processing.  Because this is the=20
first period using SAP to record time, please work closely with your=20
timekeeper to ensure the deadline is met. By now, you should have received =
a=20
note from your timekeeper.  However, if you have not and are unsure who you=
r=20
timekeeper is, please call the Site Manager for your Business Unit.  Their=
=20
names and numbers are listed below.

Because of the size of this rollout, we have to expect a few "bumps in the=
=20
road."  So, we=01,re asking you to be patient and work with us over the nex=
t few=20
weeks.  If you have questions, are experiencing problems, or would like mor=
e=20
information, please contact the Center of Expertise (COE).

Center of Expertise (COE)
The Center of Expertise can help answer many of your questions and provide=
=20
you with assistance if you are experiencing problems.  The COE is available=

-------I walked into the grocery store not ?particularly interested 
in  
buying 
groceries. ?I ?wasn't hungry. ?The pain of losing my husband of 37 years 
was 
still too raw. ?And this ?grocery store held so many sweet memories. 

?Rudy often came with me and almost every time he'd ?pretend to go off 
and 

look ??for something special. ?I knew what he was up to. ?I'd always spot 
him ?walking down the aisle with ??the three yellow roses in his hands. 
Rudy 
knew I ?loved yellow roses. ?With ?a ??heart filled with grief, I ?only 
wanted to buy my ?few items and leave, but ?even grocery shopping 
was ?different since Rudy had passed on. ?Shopping for one took time, a 
little ?more thought than it had ?for two. 

Standing by the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak and 
remembered 
how Rudy had loved his steak. 

Suddenly a woman came beside me. ?She was blond, slim and lovely in a 
soft 

green pantsuit. ?I watched as she picked up a large pack of T-bones, 
dropped 
them in her basket, hesitated, and then put them back. ?She ?turned to go 
and ?once again reached for the pack of steaks. 

She saw me watching her and she smiled. ?"My husband loves T-bones, but 
honestly, at these prices, I don't know." 

I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her ?pale blue eyes. ?"My 
husband passed away eight days ago," I told her. ?Glancing at the package 
in 
her hands, I fought to control the tremble in my voice. ?"Buy him the 
steaks. ??And cherish every moment you have together." 

She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed the 
package in her basket and wheeled away. 

I turned and pushed my cart across the length of ?the store to the dairy 
products. ?There I stood, trying to decide which ?size milk I should buy. 
A 

quart, I finally decided and moved on to the ice cream section near ?the 
front ?of the store. ?If nothing else, I could always fix myself an ?ice 
cream cone. 

I placed the ice cream in my cart and looked down ?the aisle toward the 
front. 

I saw first the green suit, then recognized the ?pretty lady coming 
towards 
?me. ?In her arms she carried a package. ?On her ?face was the  
brightest 
smile ?I had ever seen. ?I would swear a soft halo encircled her ?blond 
hair 

as she ?kept walking toward me, her eyes holding mine. ?As she ?came 
closer, 

I saw ??what she held and tears began misting in my eyes. 

"These are for you," she said and placed three ?beautiful long stemmed 
yellow ?roses in my arms. ?"When you go through the line, ?they will know 
these are ??paid for." She leaned over and placed a gentle ?kiss on my 
cheek, then smiled ?again. 

I wanted to tell her what she'd done, what the ?roses meant, but still 
unable ?to speak, I watched as she walked away as tears clouded my 
vision. 
I 
looked ?down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green ?tissue  
wrapping 
and found ?it ??almost unreal. ?How did she know? ?Suddenly the ?answer 
seemed so clear. ?I ?wasn't alone. 

?"Oh, Rudy, you haven't forgotten me, have you? ?I ?whispered, with 
tears 
in ?my ??eyes. ?He was still with me, and she was his angel. 

?Everyday be thankful for what you have and who you ?are. ?Please read 
all 

of this, it is really nice. This is a simple request. ?If ?you appreciate 
life, send this to your friends, ?including the person that ?sent it to 
you. 
Even though I clutch my blanket and growl when the ?alarm ?rings,thank 
you, 

Lord, that I can hear. ?There are many who are deaf. ?Even though I keep 
my 

eyes closed against ?the ?morning light as long as ?possible, thank you, 
Lord, that I can see. ?Many are blind. 

?Even though I huddle in my bed and put off rising, ?thank you, Lord, 
that 

I ??have the strength to rise. ??There are many who are bedridden. 

?Even though the first hour of my day is hectic, when socks are lost, 
toast 
is ??burned and tempers are short, my children are so ?loud, thank ?you, 
Lord, for ?my family. ?There are many who are lonely. ?Even though our 
breakfast table never looks like ?the pictures in ?magazines ??and the 
menu 
is at times unbalanced, thank ?you,Lord, for the ?food we have. ??There 
are 
many who are hungry. ?Even though the routine of ?my job often is 
monotonous, thank you, Lord, for ?the opportunity to ?work. ?There are 
many 
who have no job. ??Even though I grumble and bemoan ?my fate from day ?to 
day 
and wish my ??circumstances were not so modest, ?thank you, Lord, ?for 
life. 

Pass this on to the friends you know, it ?might ?help a bit to make this 
world ?a better place to live, right? 

PASS IT ON.... 
See ya later,

Hey waz up. How is your day going so far? Lunch?
This new way is weighing heavily on my mind. You wrote "2. I'm only going to
communicate with you (Bobby) through e-mail" What's really going on here?
Did it have anything to do with me. I guess what I'm really trying to say
is, ............. You know what I'm thinking.

Yes you told me that you saw us.  I blew up on someone (my boss).  I'm not
ready to talk about it  yet because it causes me to vividly relive the
whole thing and I'm just not ready to revisit that situation yet.  Although
I can say this....2 changes will be taking place because of this.
1. I'm changing my hours for 8:30 to 5:30   TO  8:00 to 5:00
2. I'm only going to communicate with you through e-mail

If you need something that's urgent,  you can leave me a message and I will
respond via email or go to another phone and call you.  (Yes , it's that
serious)
Anyway - not the end of the world just FYI.

Good morning to you also. My weekend was very quiet. You would have been

The

one
regarding you blowing up on somebody.  Oh yes did I say that I saw you and
Kandace on Friday nite around 6:30pm. Sorry I didn't drive today. Funny I
checked my voice mail most of the weekend, the moment I didn't check I get
a
call.

To further clarify Greg's e-mail, all wires being paid out of the general 
disbursement account (0530) should be coded from the company that is 
incurring the cost.  For example, if company 1N2 is sending out cash for an 
investment, the wire should reflect company 1N2 as the sender and not company 
413 as coded previously.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate 
to ask.  Thanks.

Subject: Cash Service Company Codes - ENA Co. 0530

FYI - When coding wires the sender should NOT be listed as Co. 0530.  The 
cash services companies should be tranparent to the users.  This is all 
behind the scenes in SAP and treasury.  Wires and other payment requests 
should be coded from the company that is incurring the cost (just like 
pre-SAP).  Vendors should NOT be requested to be setup on Co. 0530.  I have 
requested AP to return to sender any payment requests that have Co. 0530 as 
the paying company.

Please pass this on to your groups.  Thanks.

raydoggg68@hotmail.com, rayfordabraham@att.com,dimoore@airmail.net, 


Let's just give the devil a Holy Ghost Fit in the name of Jesus!
Father, bless everyone on this list in a special way, open supernatural
doors in their life today, give them a double portion of your Spirit as we
take back everything that the devil has stolen from us: Health,
Finance,Children, Jobs, Homes, Marriages.  Amen.

Let's take time to pray.
Take  60 seconds & give this a shot!
Let's just see satan stop this one.

All you do is:
1)    simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you this,
2)    then send it on to five other people... within hours five people
have prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of people to pray to God for
other people...then sit back and watch the power of God work in your life
for doing the thing that you know He loves.

God Bless You!!
Flora

can get there.  Thank-you.

Dana,

     Are you coming to power time?  If so, can you come early?  I just need
someone to pray with me and for me.  Satan is on my trail fast and furious.

Let me know.

That should not be a problem.  Rufino said he can cover for you.  You may ask 
if you can cover for him for part of the morning since he gets here early.

Good Morning Marnie -

Yesterday I made a dental appt. for Monday, Dec. 11th @ 5pm but I need to 
leave at 4pm to get there on time.  I have to finish a root canal that was 
started several months ago.  Do you foresee a problem with me leaving at 4pm 
that day?

This is in Publisher 2000, see if you can open it in anything.  It needs
some updates, but I can forward those to you, if this works.

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a "Workflow" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Did you know that the mangers had a catered lunch to discuss the low moral of

I've been here since 8:30am but my computer was very slow booting up and 
after it came on I couldn't get a connection to lotus notes.  I put in a call 
to Jimmy Manguba, our floor tech, while waiting for my computer to reboot.  I 
don't know what the problem was but this seemed to work.

Thanks for your response.  Brian Dawson had them.  
FYI...per Brian's question/suggestions I will be implementing a file check 
out policy procedure for our files that will help control their whereabouts.  
Starting with the E-schedules and tax files there will be an additional 
hanging file folder inside the cabinet with sign out forms inside.  Everyone 
will be expected to govern themselves accordingly for file usage.  Thanks for 
your cooperation.

No, it's not a behind!  I have obtained a copy of Two Dimensions
Preparatory Academy school application and I wanted to fax you a copy.  I
called them about 5 minutes ago asking the receptionist  about sixth grade
availability and as of this morning she was just beginning to separate the
applications by grade.  She informed me that  the children would be granted
admission on a first come, first serve basis.  This prompted me to ask her
if I could fax her a copy of the application; then she said that she could
only take the original.

I have made copies of the original and I will bring you one home this
afternoon.  The two don't look any different.  I told the receptionist
that I was off Friday morning and asked would it be too late if I brought
her the application then.  She assured me that this would be fine but, of
course, the sooner the better.  They won't start going through the
applications until around April or May.

If you have any questions call me later; but, in the mean time send me your
fax # if you would like to review the application before filling it out.

Good morning my sisters in Christ,
Hope all of you are filling God's graces this morning.
If you have the time please pass along  these words, I only had to time to
send to some ,
it doesn't mean that all of us don't deserve hearing or reading them so if
you have a moment to share with others please do so.
Your sister , Claudette


ENJOY YOUR DAY!!



December  7, 2000

VERSE:
   Wicked men are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the
righteous stands firm.
    -- Proverbs 12:7


THOUGHT:
   This is eventually true in every culture.  An evil leader is
murdered by his even more evil successor.  Ruin comes to the one
who brings ruination on others.  But ultimately, this result will
only be fully true when Jesus comes and judges all people justly
and with nothing hidden.  Then, God's righteous will shine like the
sun, and reign with him in glory which will not spoil, perish, or
fade.  Justice with mercy, love with strength, and life without
death will find their way in the city God has prepared for those
who love him.

PRAYER:
   Dear Father in heaven.  May your Kingdom come with power in our
world and may your will be done here on earth just as it is done
heaven.  Overthrow the wicked, and let those you have made
righteous in Jesus stand in the presence of your glory and grace.
In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

Dana, If you need help preparing for the trip please let me know.
As far as the hair thing I have to have mine done tonight for sure,
tomorrow is bible study, Thursday Chanel has a class, she'll already
miss Saturday because they will be out of town, so if you can't do it for me
let me know
believe me I understand. It's just convenient because you're right there,
plus those lil-nubs
do a wondrous job. Oh! please let me have a copy of the directions for
back-up just in case
we'll have an extra one. Please advise :>

I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.  I am trying to do the
majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am
also still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you
already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.
I am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them.

I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.  I am trying to do the 
majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am also 
still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you 
already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.  I 
am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them.

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)
Edith

Ben,

As per a voicemail I left you today, one of the Enron Global Markets Teams 
(Global Risk Markets) is awaiting the reversal of a check (to Goldman Sachs) 
that was wired out instead.  Kortney Brown and Dana Davis had worked with you 
and Lupy Spencer on this before.  Last anyone heard, it had made it to your 
desk.

I was checking to see if that was the case and if there would be any 
difficulty in voiding a legacy MSA check on the new SAP system.  Please let 
me know what you find or if you need any further information.

You are right.  I did misunderstand.  Sounds great to me and just for my 
information, what day and time is your group fasting?

I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but what I was trying to convey was that
Rev. Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group
by-way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up
the concerns that was given to us in the hand-outs and also anything else
that God lays on our heart.

The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque
mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that
we could be on one accord. I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us
is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not
assembled together on Monday night.

 I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on
Wednesday's, there will be some definite strongholds torn down. What do you
think?

I have already asked my team members to block out every Wednesday morning

myself, Cheryl S. & Betty).  If we need to change our time to comply with
all the members of the prayer ministry, let me know and I will get the word

Matthew 18:20 states "For where two or three are gathered together in My
name, I am there in the midst of them".

Greeting My Dear Sisters In Christ,

It has been suggested by our Prayer Ministry Leader that we establish a
common time for our Organized Units to pray. It seems as though Tuesday
night at 9:30 pm would be the  most convenient, at this present time.

It is my discernment that tonight should be our starting date. Please make
every attempt to comply with this endeavor in order that we may attack the
strongholds and be unified in  the body of Christ.

If this is not conducive for your schedule please suggest an alternative.

Be Blessed
Edith:-)

With the implementation of SAP, the employee expense report form has been 
modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form
 Wait for it to load
 Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros)

After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a 
new filename.  Do not save as Excel Template (.xlt extension).

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

If you have any questions, contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at 713 
345-7427.

Sorry this is so late, but I'm sure we can all agree this is a word in due
      season!

February 15
Weary of Worry
"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and
maketh
manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."  (2 Corinthians
2:14)

     As you fight the good fight of faith today, remember this: Your mind is
where the battle will take
place.  Whatever you allow to captivate your mind will rule your life.  Will
it
be the Word of God or
the lies of Satan?  The decision is yours.

     If you want the Word to reign, make up your mind now to resist the
devil
when he comes to
plant doubts within you.  Refuse to surrender to the circumstantial pressure
he
brings your way.
Decide at the onset that you will not succumb to this trial.  Dig your heels
in
and stand immovable
upon the promises of God.

     When thoughts come that are contrary to God's will, cast them down.
And
above all, don't
worry.  Worrying is meditating the thoughts of Satan.  When you recognize
you
are worrying, stop
it immediately.  Replace worried, fearful, and doubtful thoughts with the
Word.

     Be assured, Satan will continually try to tell you that your situation
is
hopeless.  He will
persistently peddle doubt, defeat, and discouragement. But if you won't
allow
him to sell you his
goods, his commission will be zero.  If you don't buy his lies, he can't
cause
them to come to pass
in your life.

     God has promised that He will always cause you to triumph in Christ.
You
are guaranteed
victory over any adversity you face today.  Make up your mind right now to
be a
winner and
you'll spread the knowledge of victory in Christ everywhere you go.
SCRIPTURE
READING: Philippians 4:1-9

Hi Dana,

Can you please follow-up and see where the BD card for Kevin is?  It should 
be going around for everyone to sign.  When you do catch up with it, can you 
please add the movie tickets to the card after everyone has signed it?  The 
tickets are at my desk in the back of top drawer of the drawers(where the 
supply closet key is kept) on the left as you enter my cube.  On Monday 
morning, either before or after the breakfast, please be sure to give it to 
him.  We will celebrate the rest of the October celebrants birthdays at the 
same time later.   Thanks for doing this for me Dana!

Nicole :)

There will be 3 vans downstairs on Thursday, Dec. 14 that will be 
transporting sponsors every 15-20 minutes starting at 10am.  We should try to 
be there at least 30 minues before our 1st break (11:39), so let's try to 
leave around 11am-ish?

Subject: Support Tips Emails

And you thought that it couldn't get any better.....but it does!!  Keep 
looking for the Support Tipemails coming soon to LotusNotes everywhere.

So I got my eHROnline ID.....but what's my SAP GUI id???
The SAP ID that should have been received by users this week was for BOTH eHR
Online AND the SAP GUI. 
Also remember that although several people may have been working with alpha 
IDs (rsmith) for the past several months, these IDs WILL BE TURNED OFF by 
JULY 15, 2000.  Users are STRONGLY encouraged to begin using their Pid for 
their GUI transactions, and MUST use their Pid for any time entry on eHR
Online.
  
What about the passwords?
The passwords are synchronized, so this means that when a user logs on online 
and changes their initial password from their birthday to one of their 
choosing it is changed in ALL INSTANCES OF SAP; PR1, PR2 and all online 
sessions (the online sessions are just an extension of PR1 and PR2).  This 
new password is now good IN ALL PRODUCTION BOXES, ie. PR1 and PR2.  The users 
should NOT try and log on to the GUI with their birthday if they have already 
changed their password online or viceversa.

If you have questions, please contact Betsey Tufano, SAP Security support at 
X57488.

A few hints on usernames & passwords:
Passwords are case sensitive and must be entered exactly as entered when 
created.   You can cut and paste your USERID and/or password from the 
confirmation email (Welcome) to the authentification dialogbox.

Please save the confirmation email (Welcome).  It gives you the username  and 
password you will need to use each time you register online.  Use a password 
that is easy for you to remember.

To register for a Technology Training class online, you must first give 
yourself a password. Click the "Specify Password" button below and you will 
be prompted to enter a password.  Then click the "Tech Train Setup" button 
and  you will be set up to login to the Technology Training intranet site. 
You will receive an eMail confirmation containing your login name and 
confirming your password.

Thanks Dana for the update, would you let Kevin know also thanking him, also
I will not be at the meeting tonight me and Curtis are going to Good Hope
Church to meet with Shaun.  Will you let them know about the DJ from KSBJ,
and also Curtis was able to also confirm the former radio announcer from
KTSU Dewayne B. Cook. We may want to use both of them, or just one, the
committee needs to decide.  Let Bonnie know about the letterhead
confirmation so she can get that out to KSBJ.  I thought is we really should
utilize the DJ from KSBJ!  Thanks Dana talk to you later!  Grace

Dana - 

Thanks a bunch for those Vastar fundings!  Just what I needed!

And of course, there's always more that I need...Since it's year-end, 
everyone is asking for up-to-date reports.  That's the bad news.  The good 
news is, I'm only missing the following items for Cypress and they're very 
recent.  I don't need them today, but I just wanted to let you know I'll 
probably be hunting them later this week.

Thanks again!

Pat
