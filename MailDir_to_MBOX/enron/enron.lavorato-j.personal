John, apologies for taking so long in  congratulating both of you and little Michael on the arrival of the newest  member of the family. Hope every one, in particular the mom, they always have  the most work with new babies, is well.
As a secondary thought dceg continues to do well on  a profit basis. You'd never know it bu the share price. Ultimately the numbers  will do the talking and they are looking good again for the nfourth  quarter.
Hope all is well at Enron. Should I ask if you were  able to at least cash out on any of your options? Amazing how a company's  fortunes can quickly change.
Your Uncle Frank
Aunt Joan, Michelle, Christina, Joe, Alexander and  Mathew

Please note that there is a 10 day out (from the event) full refund 
cancellation policy at the Pebble Beach resort for both hotel and golf.  In 
order to save the original dates of March 8-11, 2001 for four people, I have 
sent a deposit to confirm the reservation.  If you choose not to go with 
these dates, I will have no problem receiving a full refund.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this project and if you 
would like to look at alternate dates.
THANKS!!

Good Morning Mr. Lavorato,

I am e-mailing you to give you an update on the appraisal process.
Both appraisers went in to see the property on Friday June 16, 2000.  We are 
expecting one written report today and the other one tomorrow.  We should be 
in a position to give you your guarantee price by the middle of next week.

I was advise by Cendant Mobility that your spouse's first name is Dina.  
Please advise me if this is not the correct spelling of her name.  I will 
correct it in our system.   You can contact me by return e-mail at 
Pfournie@Royallepage2.com or by phone at 416-386-6028 or 1-800-410-2983 ext. 
6028
Since I'm not totally sure at this point if your family has already vacated 
the property in Calgary so I don't want to send any documents there.   I am 
attaching three documents to this e-mail so that you have them with you .

The first document is the offer information form and disclosure statement.  
Since this document forms part of the guaranteed offer,  and would ask you to 
please complete this document and return it to me by fax by Monday June 
26th.  My fax# is 416-448-6358.

The second document is a blank guarantee offer.   This document will be used 
in the event that you are able to negotiate a verbal agreement with a buyer 
prior to a guarantee price being established.
If this situation occurs, please insert the agreed upon price and sign the 
RLRS Offer,.  Return it by fax , along with the Power of Attorney which forms 
part of this package.
Once these documents are received by RLRS, we are in a legal position to sign 
an offer on your home showing RLRS as the vendor.

The last document is the amended sale program  procedures . This is the 
relocation program that has been approved by your company for your 
relocation. It outlines in detail the procedures to be followed under that 
program.
It is a program that has been designed by the I.R.S. and the U.S. relocation 
council to deal with the issues of relocation and taxable benefits.
One thing that I want to you to remember is that if you have an offer on your 
property,  you must negotiate it verbally and please do not signed nor 
initial anything on the offer.  Once you have come to a verbal agreement  
with a purchaser, Royal Lepage will sign that offer on your behalf.

You can contact me at the office between 8:00 to 4:00 or leave a voice mail 
message anytime.

I will be on vacation next week June 26th to June 30th. If you need 
assistance during that week please contact Jessica Desouza at 416-510-5764 or 
you can use the 800# and ask for ext. 5764.  Jessica will contact you next 
week with your guarantee price.

Could you also please e-mail me your mailing address where to courier your 
guaranteed offer.

Do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions

Thank you,

Patricia Fournier
Relocation Consultant

John, the Compensation + number is the approximate 30% gross-up you were getting on all your paycheques.

The Phantom stock taxable benefit is the tax on stock issued in 2000 that was unvested at year-end.  The value is calculated as:

Units issued				14,415 units
US share price on date issued		$55.50
Discount on stock price for volatility	33%
US share price after discount		37.00
F/X rate					1.4499
Cdn share price				$53.65
Value of taxable benefit			$773,350.08

John, you need to talk to your tax advisors regarding this stock.  When you leave a country you are deemed to dispose of assets at Fair Market Value.  I don't know what value would be put on this stock by both the Cdn and US taxation authorities as they had not vested at date of departure.

Incentive pay		1,955,917.39		box 14

Retention bonus	   288,560.00		box 14

Pension 		       7,992.75		box 52
United way		       1,375.00		box 46

So as you can see, John did have taxable income of $9mm even though not all of it was actual cash in his pocket.  I think that boxes 38 and 40 through most people because they don't realize that those numbers are included in box 14.

If you need more info, please let me know.

Hi John,

I am sending out by courier today your guarantee offer.

Regarding the repairs that need to be done on your property, I will 
coordinate them with you agent and the cost of the repairs will be deducted 
from your equity.  I will send you a copy of the bills once we receive them 
to let you know how much will be deducted.

Best regards,

Patricia

I don't have electronic versions of the tax treatment of restricted stock in Canada but will get you hard copies of the data/decisions provided by PriceWaterhouseCoopers on taxation in Canada and by Arthur Andersen on the discount applied.

John, I'll fax copies to you.

The formula we used to determine the taxable benefit on the amended T4 was:

$55.50 (Stock price on 01/18/00)  - 18.50 (33% discount) X 1.4499 (Fx rate) X number of units = Tax Benefit

Kim/John - can you please verify that your fax number is unchanged at 713-646-3227.  Thanks....

Hi, Tony Borelli the recruiting writer here. (the guy you just talked to)

Below I've pasted the text of your brief interview/profile blurb for the
Enron recruiting web site. It consists of a main section and a short
"callout quote" to be set apart from it, maybe in a different typeface.

Please review it ASAP, and reply to this email, either approving it as is
(which I would love) or listing any changes that I need to make. NOTE:
Please list any changes separately, rather than editing the text directly.

I ask that you focus on looking for any errors of fact, revelations of
proprietary information, statements that will genuinely make someone look
bad, or other such serious problems.

The informal style and tone, the general content, and the length have all
been predetermined, and they need to match all the other blurbs we're doing
for the site. So I'd ask that you not focus on those issues or change those
parameters, and that you avoid doing any wholesale rewriting unless you
think it's absolutely unavoidable.

Please be brave! Keep in mind that whole platoons of Enron communications
and legal specialists will review and edit everything carefully before the
public ever sees it. And of course, since this will appear only in web
format, even after it "goes live" it will never really be permanent.

Thanks for all your help!
--Tony
TEXT IS BELOW:


John Lavorato
Managing Director (trading and risk management)
Enron North America

I started in Calgary in 1995, building our Canadian natural gas and
electrical power trading operation from scratch, and I left as president. It
was absolutely awesome. I had the time of my life. I hired the people I
wanted, with very little supervision, back when gas and power trading was in
its infancy, and today we're the biggest market maker and risk manager
there. These days, as many people know, we're using that same expertise to
create liquid markets in many other products, from broadband capacity to
paper pulp. So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in
Canada-to help build revolutionary new businesses.

But what some people might not realize is that even in our established gas
and power trading operations-where we're by far the dominant player-it's
hugely interesting and complicated, with a million variables to figure out,
from the weather to the available storage capacity in Montana. You can't
ship natural gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like
other commodities. And it's not like trading bonds, where you sit around
waiting for the Fed. If you like solving incredibly complex problems, and
you're very good at it ... get down here! We need you!

Enron's not a place where you can hide-or where you'll be hidden. If you
can't get it done, you won't fit in. But if you can, and you work hard,
you'll get noticed, you'll excel, you'll get paid, and we're going to love
you.

John -- Sorry we did not catch up when I was in Houston in December.  At the time, I was in the process of leaving the company I helped to start  and have joined a sports marketing agency to build their international business.
At some point, I would be interested in speaking with you about some projects (domestic and international) that we're working on.  One of our business groups specialize in the stadium/properties naming rights field and there are some great opportunities including the new Pittsburgh Steelers stadium.  I thought one of your companies or possibly New Power might have an interest in taking a look at it.  Let me know when you have a free moment.
Cheers, BA

Mr. Lavorato,

Hello.  Below are estimates on the vacation we discussed last week.  I
know that Jamaica was not a set destination but I really feel something
like the FDR Resort might be a good options for a family vacation.  One
of the biggest pluses is the nanny you are assigned upon arrival I think
most people find it really makes the vacation stress fee.  I will be
honest with you there are other resorts in the Caribbean that are nicer
but they are not family resorts.  Programs and things are offered for
children usually starting at 4 years (sometimes 3) of age nanny services
are not really provide and just babysitting that must be prearranged.  If
features like the nanny service are not as important to you then I will
make other suggestions.   I am not including rates on the Boscobel Beach
Resort because they just closed to do renovation that will last until
December 2001.  If you have any questions, need additional information,
or would like to set up reservations please do not hesitate to call or
E-mail.


Regards,
Crystal Schwartz

The following is what I have found at Pebble Beach for the month of March:

Only one weekend is available for both the hotel and golf.  Accommodations at 
Inn at Spanish Bay for 4 guests arriving Thursday, March 8, 2001 departing 
Sunday, March 11, 2001.  There is a minimum of a two night stay but you can 
use any combination within these dates.  Ocean View room rate is 
$525.00/person/night.

Golf Availability:
Links at Spanish Bay - Friday, March 9 at 7:20 a.m. - Golf Fee $185.00/pp 
includes 2 carts
Pebble Beach Golf Links - Saturday, March 10 at 12:00 p.m. - Golf Fee 
$300.00/pp includes 2 carts
Spyglass Hill Golf Course - Sunday, March 11 at 7:30 a.m. - Golf Fee 
$225.00/pp includes 2 carts
(Please note:  Only these courses and these tee times are available to play 
on these dates.)

If you are not planning to stay on property, tee times can only be reserved 
60 days out at The Links at Spanish Bay, 30 days out at Spyglass Hill and one 
day in advance at Pebble Beach Golf Links.

Average high temperature in the Monterey area during the month of March is 62 
degrees and the average low temperature is 45 degrees.

Attached is some information on the hotel and golf courses as well as driving 
times and directions from nearby airports.

The resort will only hold these dates until the end of the week so please let 
me know if you would be interested in confirming.  If you choose to look at 
alternate dates, I would be happy to check availability for you.
THANKS!!

I an glad to hear that all our 4Q'93 friends are fine. It is a real sorrow to
know about the classmate that died. These are truly difficult times and we
have to do our best to keep our hopes up. Sorry, but I did not get to check
my personal e-mail till today.

On a better note, let me tell you all that last week I had my civil wedding
with a charming girl from Brasil, named Kelly. We will have our religious
wedding next year in Brasil, hopefully we will see a few there on June 8th.
We are living in Mexico City right now, and would be very glad to hear from
any of you and go out, if you come here once in a while. My phone is
525-281-03-67.

All the best, and try to keep a positive attitude to get through this
international "hump". At the end everything will be better for "that which
does not kill us, only makes us stronger".

John,

Thanks for your help with Husnain.  I think he will be a solid asset for EBS

As for the "trade", I do not think that I should be brokering a personnel 
deal like that without the individual's input.  However, I would definitely 
encourage you to talk to any of my people that you would like to have.    I 
have an open door policy, if they want to pursue other internal jobs.  

After speaking with you last week, it was very clear to me that you were 
unsatisfied (unhappy) with my failure to be specific about individuals that I 
was recruiting.  I will not make that mistake again.  I would ask only that 
you inform Jim or myself of the individuals that you would want to recruit.

Additionally,  I think that you and Kevin Hannon have spoken about an 
exchange program in which our junior commercial people would be able to 
rotate through a transaction intensive trading group.  I think this type of 
program could be mutually beneficial and I would appreciate if we could talk 
about this in greater detail.

Regards,

Paul

John -- Sorry we did not catch up when I was in Houston in December.? At the 
time, I was in the process of leaving the company I helped to start? and have 
joined a sports marketing agency to build their international business.

At some point, I would be interested in speaking with you about some projects 
(domestic and international) that we're working on.? One of our business 
groups specialize in the stadium/properties naming rights field and there are 
some great opportunities including the new Pittsburgh Steelers stadium.? I 
thought one of your companies or possibly New Power might have an interest in 
taking a look at it.? Let me know when you have a free moment.

Cheers, BA

The 2000 Federal Budget was recently announced.  Here are some of the 
highlights that you might find interesting:

Stock Options:

The amount of the stock option benefit reported as income is reduced from 3/4 
to 2/3 on options exercised after February 27, 2000.  In other words, 33% is 
not taxable (was 25%).

Tax Rates:

Basic personal exemption will increase to $7,231 (currently $7,131)
this change will be effective on the July 1-15 pay and will be doubled for 
the remainder of 2000

Spousal amount is increasing to $6,140 (currently $6,055)

The new tax rate structure for 2000:

17% of taxable income up to $30,004 (was $29,590)
25% of taxable income between $30,004 and $60,009 (was $29,590 to $59,180)
29% of taxable income in excess of $60,009 (was $59,180)

Limits to Foreign Content Increased:

Despite a "hot tip" that RRSP contribution limits would be raised in this 
year's budget, it did not happen.  However, the foreign content limit for 
RPPs and RRSPs is increased from 20% to 25% for 2000 and to 30% for 2001.

Call me if you would like any further information.

You know, when the accountant does the spreadsheet, it looks exactly right.  
The numbers I sent you were pulled out of context of the big picture - I need 
to re-do that (again!) for Jane's letter.  However, what you were paid is 
correct (except for the gross up on the vacation pay which we still owe 
you).  Laura says this will make complete sense when you see her spreadsheet 
and I believe her.....

If you call changing the world not much to do, so be it.  I know Texas is a
big state, but is there enough room to accommodate your arrogance and
Waldren's?

By the way, I want to bring Dena (I think it's with an 'e') something for
putting up with Rich and James.  What kind of perfume does she like?  - Or,
what else might she appreciate?

Give me an idea of required clothing for the evenings.  I assume shorts for
golfing.

Jane,

Sorry for the delay.   Please be advised of the following:

De Geurin Realty, Inc
2650 Fountainview, Suite #300
Houston,  TX   77057

Contact:  Phyllis Peak (I believe Phyllis worked with David Oxley)
713-789-9999 - Office -
713-528-5801 - Home -

or

Greenwood-King Properties
3200 Kirby, Suite 200
Houston, TX   77098

Contact:  Jacque Morris
713-524-1228 - Office
713-851-2917 - Cell Phone

Both of the above can provide the services requested.  I am not sure of the 
costs, however, they are both very reasonable.

Thanks.

John, I've been meaning to drop you a note to say thanks for the golf
weekend, but things have been a little crazy since I've been back.
Shannon's mom passed away last Wednesday, so I was on a plane to Thunder Bay
within a couple of hours and up there until Sunday night.

It was great seeing you, Dina, Michael and Rich.  He's a great kid (Michael,
not Rich).  Please give my thanks to DIna again.  By the way, are you
missing a car key?  I just unpacked my golf bag and there was a key chain in
the golf travel bag with a BMW key on it.  My intuitive mind tells me that
the key is probably yours.  Give me your mailing address and I'll send it
down to you.

Mark

Hey John,

I can't believe it - again, I just finished watching
lefty lose a major. Oh well, someday he'll win I
guess.  There was some good golf though, especially on
Saturday.

So, if you haven't figured it out yet, it's me, the
lefty from Canada.  How are things?

Sorry to bother you at work. I don't have your home
email or new phone number in Houston.

Anyhow, I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions
about life in the US.  Yes, I finally accepted a job,
in Fairfax, Virginia, a suburb community about 15
miles west of Washington.  It is a multi-disciplinary
design firm, and I am going to be starting in the
first week of October. And the area seems to be really
nice, great golf, not much winter, great pro sports,
and hopefully lovely 'Americanan gals'!!!

I think I have almost everything under control thus
far, except I have a couple of questions that I
wouldn't mind your opinion on.

First, I want to select a bank just for simple
personal banking, cheques, withdrawls , etc.  In
Fairfax, the predominant one seems to be Bank of
America.  They also have SunTrust and United.  The
other ones (like Fleet, First Union etc.) don't seem
to be really located there much.
I guess I'm looking for a major bank to start off with
like the CIBC or Royal in Canada. Is Bank of America
OK. What do you think?

Secondly, (due to my Italian 'cheap' save money
attitude), I am looking for a VISA that collects air
miles. (In Canada here, I had CIBC Aerogold which was
excellent for Air Canada reward travels). I guess I am
looking for a gold/platinum card that is best for
flight miles.  I flew United when I went to the
interview to Washington, and I understand that United
has a Mileage Plus First Gold VISA.  Also, I have
found other cards including Delta Skymiles AMEX, US
Air Dividend Miles Platinum, Continental Platinum and
TWA Aviators Gold.  I guess ideally am I looking for
the best card that will allow me to accumulate points
to fly from Washington to Toronto (since that's where
most people I know live now).  I am also not to sure
which airlines are reputable that would fly into
Toronto.  Maybe you could tell me what card you guys
have, or which ones might be worth looking into.

Anyhow, I would really appreciate when you have a
chance sometime to drop me a line or give me a ring
(905)709-7970 with some of this info.

As for now, have a great rest of day at work.  Say
'hi' to Dina and Little 'Tiger'.  Hope all is well
with you guys.  Maybe I will get to see you more now
that it is not so far and so expensive to fly down
there.

Take care for now, JR.

P.S.  Yes there is another stadium in the world to see
a ball game other than Wrigley.  I saw Boston at
Cambden Yards last weekend and it was awesome.  What a
classic modern baseball stadium design. And the Ripken
mania stuff is nuts.  The Ribs in Baltimore are
amazing, just like wings in Buffalo. See you later.

John,

Thanks for the time today.  I enjoyed talking to you about your plans for 
East Power and the 24 Hour Group.   I have been nothing but impressed with 
the caliber of people here at Enron during my short tenure, and you are no 
exception.  Leadership starts at the top, and I am encouraged that you 
represent this through your clear direction for the group and willingness to 
listen to the ideas and suggestions of your employees. 

Thanks again,

Larry

Hi all!! or Y'all (which ever you  prefer)
=20
Great summer, 3 weeks in Italy (tuscany) with my  wife and kids.  I love Tu=
scany.  Cannot wait to see the rest of  Italy and start getting into more o=
f Europe...next year.  Other than that  I went to my kid sisters baby's chr=
istening.  So weird to see my sister  that way, those of you with younger s=
ibs know what I mean.
=20
It seems, like so many others, the  entreprenuerial song is calling me...ag=
ain.  I had a lot of fun in  dot.com land, but I am certain that one has pl=
ayed itself out for  now.  Also, in all honesty, I think I will leave this =
technology stuff to  the rest of you.  I get it, but man...there are too ma=
ny ideas in each  sector for little ol' me to keep up with.
=20
So, I find it is a good time to get back to my  roots and what I was doing =
around the 5-yr reunion; LBOs.  This time I am  focusing on my true love, t=
urnarounds; the messier the better.  I have  set up a partnership.  Initial=
ly, my partners and I seek mfgs  ($5MM to $50MM) of products with ticket pr=
ices under $100 per unit sold, with  losses or breakeven performance.  They=
 need to be in the Midwest, and in  Greater Chicago if they are less than $=
10MM in rev.
=20
Example: this summer we bid on a $30MM mfg of  brass ingots (cost $25 bucks=
 an ingot altough sales where in the $100K plus  per order), with losses ro=
ughly of $3MM per year.  It had lots of  financiable assets and a core busi=
ness that was viable.  Management had  stopped paying attention to cash flo=
w and thereby ran the ship  aground.
=20
It does not have to be that mundane, but you get  the picture.
=20
So that sort of stuff should keep me real busy  for a while.  If you come a=
cross small/middle market companies with these  kinds of issues, drop me a =
line.  Especially, those of you in really big  companies with lots  of no-o=
ne-can-remember-why-we-bought-this-company-in-the-first-place  little divis=
ions.
=20
If you are in Chicago, drop me a line.  If  you are flying in or out of Chi=
cago, wave just before you land, you are just  over my house.
=20
Until next time...

Thanks Andy for pulling this together!

Hi everyone, it's Sheraton Kalouria.  I just returned from a vacation in
Ibiza, Spain, where I must say I thought frequently of our 4-Quarter class.
And not JUST because I drank too much (!).  The exposure to interesting,
diverse personalities reminded me how enriching getting to know all of you
was.

Quick update:

I'm living alone in Los Angeles.  Like a ping-pong ball, I'm on the left
coast again.  Give me time, no doubt I'll be back in New York.  But I don't
expect that to happen any time soon, as a), I have 2 years remaining on my
contract with NBC, where I'm the head of the Daytime programming unit, and
b), I bought a house in the Hollywood Hills and I now have too much
furniture to be contained in even the very largest domestic mini-van.

It's hard to believe how much time has passed and it's really great to hear
how well everyone is doing. After 7 years with ABC, I jumped at the chance
to lead a department, even though it was mired in third place for many years
in the ratings.  Since my arrival, I'm happy to report we've gone from
"worst to first" on the strength of our two soap operas, DAYS OF OUR LIVES
and PASSIONS.  My marketing skills were put to the test when we launched an
unprecedented novelization of a soap which ultimately landed on the New York
Times best sellers list for 7 weeks.  I even had the good fortune of
interfacing with Marc Sznajderman on some NBCi.com matters.

Here are the vitals.

Sheraton Kalouria

Los Angeles, CA 90046
h) 323-850-7437
m) 818-903-7437
w) 818-840-4225

If any of you are in the Los Angeles area, please give me a call-I'd love to
catch up.  Also, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno tapes right here at NBC in
Burbank and I would be happy to assist you with VIP tickets to a taping if
you're interested.

<font size=3D3 color=3D"#0000FF">Dear Greg, Eric, Addison:<br>
<br>
</font><font color=3D"#0000FF">Per my discussion with Bill Perkins
and Eric
last week, as a starting point to understand the Hermosa LNG
Project,
attached are some documents that we have prepared over the past few
months along with a paper from a recent LNG conference on "Offshore
LNG Unloading."=A0 I would hope this would begin to give you a
sense of the scope of the project.=A0 There are, of course, many
issues that need to be addressed.=A0 There has been substantial
front-end work performed on the relative feasibility of using
existing
offshore pipeline infrastructure in support of importing LNG into
California.=A0 <br>
<br>
Key aspects of the Hermosa project are:<br>
<br>
</font><font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>There is an
existing
(unused) gas pipeline extending from the Hermosa petroleum
platform that
can be tied into Sempra=92s onshore existing intrastate gas pipeline
infrastructure that can carry 400 mmscfd.<br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>There is currently
adequate
and idle equipment that could be relocated to provide LNG import
rates of
400 mmscfd.<br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>A single ship
unloading pump
can readily and continuously supply LNG at a rate equivalent to 400
mmscfd.<br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>California is the
prime
target for increased natural gas supply.<br>
<br>
<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">=A8 </font>Once importation is
initiated through Hermosa, the precedent has been set to construct
a
permanent, larger floating LNG import terminal<br>
<br>
Some of the major areas of concern that are covered with this set
of
attachments include:<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">
<dl>
<dd>=A8 </font>Ability to offload from LNG ship to an existing oil
platform.<font face=3D"Symbol" color=3D"#0000FF">

John,

Here are 2 attachments that you can look at in order to gain an
understanding of your tax liabilities.

(See attached file: US & Cdn Tax Expected Owing.doc)

The above attachment outlines on a high level the calculations Laurie
prepared in order to estimate your
liability in Canada and the U.S.

(See attached file: 2000 Cap Gains.xls)

This attachment includes worksheets calculating capital gains for the year
2000. The first 3 tabs are for the Canadian return with the fourth
calculating U.S. capital gains.


If you have any questions they can be discussed anytime.

Not explicitly, but your preference was clear.

I should have forseen your response....remember about six years ago I asked, "You've given me alot of work, what priority should I asign to each project?"  You responded,  "No priority, get them all done!"

John:  when you receive your L1A visa at preflight inspection in Canada, I 
will need a copy of the I-94 card that is stapled into your passport.  Please 
be sure the red stamp comes out clearly on the copy to show the date of entry

Hi Jane - I'm trying to make this clear but let me know if I've missed 
something or if you have a different understanding of the arrangement:

Janice re-calculated the retro payment to include the 21% gross-up and is 
arranging to deposit to John's account (gross amt is 22,626.90 less taxes = 
$9,955.84).  In the meantime, the new USD amount for your moving package 
letter is $141,479.04 USD       (141,480, rounded).  When we convert to CAD 
(1.4978), it's $211,907.30 (211,908.74, rounded)

Here's the breakdown:
211,907.30 (Total Paid - Gross) CAD
-149,780.00 (100,000 at 1.4978) - original bonus payment
-31,453.80 (21,000 at 1.4978) - original bonus payment, grossed up
-8,046.60 (Add'l payment for new salary retro to Apr)
-22,626.90 (Gross-up adj re retro payment)
0.0

Key Points:
John Lavorato's effective transfer date from Calgary to Houston is June 16, 
2000
a payment of $141,479.04 USD (141,480, rounded) is made to John for 
completion of duties in Canada - this is converted to CAD $211,907.30 
(211,908.74, rounded)

Jane, please send me a copy of the revised letter (relocation) so we can have 
something authorizing us to make this payment.  
Thanks!!

He was owed $74,240 for the retro payment, he was paid $59,943.40, so the 
difference is 14,296.60 less taxes of 6,250.00.  The net deposit is $8,046.60 
Canadian.

I understand John received a retro payment of salary.  In order to document

payment and when it was made?

Thanks.

Hey,

New Hockey season starts this Sunday.  We may need some more players on our
team.  Games start between 7:30pm and 9:30 pm every Sunday for about 10
weeks or so.  Cost is 250.00.  Let me know if you are interested.  If you
want to play less you may be able to split games with someone.

Love,

Scott

Subject: Possibility of Delay in Alberta Restructuring

Rob, I spoke to Larry Charach of the ADRD on Friday and specifically asked if 
the Government was considering a delay of its restructuring timetable to: 1) 
address concerns of consumers that it is impossible for them to make a choice 
of supplier prior to November 1, 2000, and/or 2) to give time to develop a 
workable Plan B.  Larry was adamant that there will be no delay in Alberta 
and said there is no point in any stakeholder even proposing a delay because 
it such a proposal was a "non-starter" and won't happen.  He told me during 
the discussion that investors will not invest in a jurisdiction where the 
government does not follow through with what it says it will do and he 
referred to the Jan 1, 2001 date as a firm commitment of the government 
entrenched in the legislation.  I agreed with him that this was absolutely 
the right approach and told him that the Government had Enron's full support 
on this issue.

John,

Just wanted to make sure everything went o.k.  I neglected to remind you 
again when we talked today about obtaining the Certificate of Occupancy, so I 
hope that the Seller delivered it as she had promised.  If not let me know so 
that we can find an immediate solution.  The only other things I would 
caution you on at this point would be as follows:

1)  Make sure to put together your list of warranty repairs prior to 30 days 
from today's date and to deliver same to the Seller within such time period 
(per the warranty agreement).

2)  Make sure to follow up with the Seller about the fireplace.  She is 
supposed to finish that work within 60 days from today's date.

3)  Make sure to compare your title policy, when it comes in the mail, to the 
marked Title Commitment you received today.  There shouldn't be anything in 
the policy that is not in the Title Commitment.  When you get the policy, you 
can send a copy to me and I will be glad to confirm this for you.

4)  You should get the recorded deed in the mail from the title company or 
the county clerk.  If you do not receive it within 30 days, call the title 
company and ask that they find it or obtain a certified copy for you.

If there is anything you need, just let me know.

John,

Happy New Year!!  I wish you and your family the best and as Dina puts
it...BUY LOW, SELL HIGH (lol).

I have a great deal of songs to send you.  Just look at the lists (you can
open it with Wordpad) and let me know wich ones you like or if you prefer I
will send them all to you.  Also, I wont be able to send them via e-mail
(too big in memory size).  Therefore, check to see if your IT group have an
IOmega Zip Drive (100 MB) so that I can mail the songs to you.

I have attached the copy of the mi2 theme song and a catalog of the
Corvette.

John, I apologize for all the emails back and forth.  We had to make a 
revision on the last retroactive calculation (we called in the "big gun" - 
Laura Scott) and are confident that this is the definitive payment.  I've 
also attached a summary that Janice prepared outlining all payments received 
to date - hopefully, it will clear everything up.  Call if it requires 
further explanation.  (x6724)....
