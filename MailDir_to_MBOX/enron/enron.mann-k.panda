Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have enclosed drafts of the following documents:

1.  Escrow Agreement marked to reflect changes from the draft previously
circulated; and
2.  Escrow Disbursement Instruction Letter.

Please review and advise of any comments.  Note that Citibank has not seen
or approved the enclosed forms, although the Escrow Agreement is identical
to one previously acceptable to them.  I have contacted Citibank about the
escrow, and they are to get back to me with a contact and fee information.

Gentlemen:

We have enclosed drafts of the following documents:

1.  Resolutions of sole member of Salmon Energy LLC authorizing the turbine
acquisition and related documents;
2.  Incumbency Certificate of ENA for the escrow agent; and
3.  Incumbency Certificate of PPL for the escrow agent.

The resolutions authorize the turbine contract, the loan from PPL, and the
G/E consent and agreement.  I have also drafted resolutions to be dated the
day following closing to elect as directors the persons named in the Amended
and Restated LLC Agreement (need the names of these persons - three
designees of PPL and one designee of ENA) and to replace the officers of the
LLC with persons designated by PPL.  If the lender desires Salmon
resolutions authorizing a security agreement to be signed by Salmon, we
would recommend that the new Salmon board controlled by PPL sign resolutions
ratifying and approving the security agreement, rather than have ENA approve
a security agreement that it has not negotiated and is not familiar with.

>From a timing standpoint, we need to focus on the documentation required to
set up the escrow account, as I understand that the escrow may be funded on
the same day as the financial closing, namely, Thursday, April 19.  Citibank
will need (I) the escrow agreement, (ii) an incumbency certificate from each
party to the escrow agreement, (iii) a W-9 signed by each non-corporate
party to the escrow agreement, and (iv) a signed fee agreement.  The
incumbency certificates are enclosed.  Please insert names and other
information as appropriate.  We need comments to the Escrow Agreement in as
soon as possible in order that we can provide these documents to Citibank
for approval.

Thank you.

Our counsel has provided these drafts of the project documents.  Please 
review.  We also anticipate sending out the turbine contracts later today.

Please be advised of our timeline.  Since we need to fund escrow by Wednesday 
21 March, it is imperative that we are able to sign these documents on Friday 
16 March.  It is our assumption there will be some lag between the obligation 
to fund escrow and the actual transfer of funds.  

Your comments to these documents are expected by Friday 9 March.

I also want to mention that Enron initiated the additional purchase of Power 
System Stabilizers, which cost $31,675 per turbine.  PSS are required in the 
WSCC.  If you desire this optional equipment, please reflect that cost in 
your final bid.

Insert at p. 42 as ARTICLE XII.

ARTICLE XII.
ADJUSTMENTS REGARDING UNITS WITH
SERIAL NUMBERS LISTED IN EXHIBIT P

12.1 Adjustments in Performance Guarantees to Reflect Site Conditions.  
Seller recognizes that the Sites for the Units identified and listed by 
serial number in Exhibit P have not been identified by Purchaser.  When the 
Site for each such Unit has been identified and the corresponding Site 
conditions for each such Unit has been provided by Purchaser to Seller, 
Seller and Purchaser agree to amend the Guaranteed Levels and the Specific 
Performance Levels for each such Unit to reflect changes in the Basis 
Conditions made to reflect the Site conditions for each such Unit.  The 
Guaranteed Levels and Specific Performance Levels as so amended will be 
consistent with those customarily provided by Seller for other LM 6000 
Enhanced  Sprint combustion turbine generator units in the United States with 
comparable Site conditions.
12.2 Storage of Unit(s).  Seller and Purchaser recognize and agree that the 
period or periods during which any of the Units identified and listed by 
serial number in Exhibit P is placed in storage (a) by Seller pursuant to 
Section 10.2.7 or (b) by Purchaser, as agreed between Seller and Purchaser, 
shall not be considered, directly or indirectly, in determining the 
commencement of the Primary Warranty Period or the Extended Warranty Period, 
or both.
12.3 Maximum Period of Seller Liability.  To the extent any Unit identified 
and listed by serial number in Exhibit P is placed in storage as contemplated 
in Section 12.2, the duration of such storage period shall be added, in the 
case of each such Unit, to the six (6)-year period identified in the last 
sentence of Section 27.1 for purposes of calculating the maximum duration of 
Seller's liability with respect to any such Unit and with respect to this 
Agreement.
12.4 No Effect on Cost, Schedule or Scope of Work.  Seller and Purchaser 
agree that implementation of the provisions and agreements of this Article 
XII shall be at no additional cost or result in any other change or impact to 
or upon the Scope of Work, Purchase Amount or Guaranteed Unit Delivery Dates, 
or all of them.

Kay and Greg:

Please see the attached information from Citibank.  The form escrow
agreement attached below is the document that our escrow agreement is based
from, so we can ignore the blank form for now.  The remaining documents are
items required for a Citibank escrow, namely an incumbency certificate from
each party and a fee schedule.  Also included are money market investment
options.  It seems that finance input from the clients may be desirable at
this point with respect to the escrow agreement and related documents.

At Citibank's request, I furnished them a copy of the letter agreement
calling for the establishment of the escrow arrangement.  Once we are in
agreement on the form of the escrow agreement and the disbursement
instructions, we need to forward those items to Citibank as well for their
review.  Please advise.  Thank you.

Folks:

I just got off the phone with Lee Johnson at GE. I described the overall deal 
to him ("Intergen" style deal with the current 4 LV Cogen units, and a 
purchase of 4 additional units as a replacement), but did not disclose that 
the counterparty is Panda. Lee is totally on board, and thought this would be 
a great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which 
means that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is 
prepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we 
proceed with as simple a transaction as possible.

I would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the 
transaction as soon as possible.

Fred-could you please contact everyone and set this up? I'm available all day 
today, and tomorrow to 3 PM EST.

As soon as I get the revised proposal from Lee, I will forward it to the 
group.

Regards,

Ben

Kay:

Note the following timetable from the final version of the ENA/PPL letter
agreement:

(1)  ENA agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the final
form of the turbine contract on or before April 11, 2001.
(2)  The parties agreed to commercially reasonable efforts to execute an
escrow agreement on or before April 16, 2001.
(3)  The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of
(a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the
closing of PPL's financing.
(4)  ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19,
2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business
day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine
contract).
(5)  The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days
after funding the escrow account.
(6)  Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before
May 3, 2001.

If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001,
then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands.  PPL's obligation to fund
the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing.  Greg
Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give
an estimated date for financial closing.

I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were
causing heartburn.  He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker.  He asked
today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be
appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point.  He also
requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions.  When you get a
chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for
PPL's review.  Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form
of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to
negotiate the fee.  Let me know if we can assist in this regard.  Thanks.

Kay:

We have attached execution copies of the following documents for execution
by GE:

1.  GE Letter re Forms of Agreement;
2.  GE Consent and Agreement;
3.  Legal Opinion of Counsel to GE;
4.  GE Receipt.

These documents were circulated by Isabel Parker to Kent Shoemaker, you, me
and others on April 23, 2001.

The only other document is the GE Parent Guaranty.  Greg Lang circulated
comments (in a PDF file) by an e-mail 4/18 at 5:59 p.m.   Greg asked earlier
today whether the form of this document had been agreed by GE and I could
not respond.

You should have the following documents:

1.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement; and
2.  Turbine Contract.

Several of the ENA documents are not yet finalized, so I will try to get
those to you after lunch.  Please send over the LLC certificate book in
order that we may prepare membership certificates.

If you have any questions or comments, please advise.  Thanks.

Bill/Dale/Kay-

I've made redline edits with regards to LVCII performance guarantee values
in Section 10.7 for output and heat rate based on the Feb 8, 2001 guarantee
sheet.

Dale, please send revised LVC II facility agreement to reflect Units 25-28
with appropriate schedules for price, delivery, payment and termination
schedules at your earliest convenience.

The units 19-20 and 23-24 that are currently reflected in this document will
be left in E-Next (Turbopark).  The schedules for price, delivery, payment
will remain the same for these units.

Thanks,

Lee

Hi Kent,

These are some requested changes to the Salmon a/k/a Delta break out 
agreement.  I'm not comfortable that Lee has reviewed these, as the comments 
were previously forwarded in another email.  In any event, we are looking for 
GE's blessings on this addition.

It seems to me that we are approaching time to gather GE's signatures on the 
various docs.  I will forward separately the email I received from our 
outside counsel with the final forms of everything but the break out 
contract, the assignment and assumption agreement and the GE parent guaranty.

Thanks for your assistance.

Site for each such Unit has been identified and the corresponding Site 
conditions for each such Unit has been provided by Purchaser to Seller, 
Seller and Purchaser agree to amend the Guaranteed Levels and the Specific 
Performance Levels for each such Unit to reflect changes in the Basis 
Conditions made to reflect the Site conditions for each such Unit.  The 
Guaranteed Levels and Specific Performance Levels as so amended will be 
consistent with those customarily provided by Seller for other LM 6000 
Enhanced  Sprint combustion turbine generator units in the United States with 
comparable Site conditions.
12.2 Storage of Unit(s).  Seller and Purchaser recognize and agree that the 
period or periods during which any of the Units identified and listed by 
serial number in Exhibit P is placed in storage (a) by Seller pursuant to 
Section 10.2.7 or (b) by Purchaser, as agreed between Seller and Purchaser, 
shall not be considered, directly or indirectly, in determining the 
commencement of the Primary Warranty Period or the Extended Warranty Period, 
or both.
12.3 Maximum Period of Seller Liability.  To the extent any Unit identified 
and listed by serial number in Exhibit P is placed in storage as contemplated 
in Section 12.2, the duration of such storage period shall be added, in the 
case of each such Unit, to the six (6)-year period identified in the last 
sentence of Section 27.1 for purposes of calculating the maximum duration of 
Seller's liability with respect to any such Unit and with respect to this 
Agreement.
12.4 No Effect on Cost, Schedule or Scope of Work.  Seller and Purchaser 
agree that implementation of the provisions and agreements of this Article 
XII shall be at no additional cost or result in any other change or impact to 
or upon the Scope of Work, Purchase Amount or Guaranteed Unit Delivery Dates, 
or all of them.

WOW!  We need to start having old fashioned closings with lunch and the 
exchange of signed documents.  By copy of this, I'm asking Ed to track down 
as many docs as he can and Kay, can you come up with the CA Development I and 
II docs for Lee?

Sheila,

I hate to do this to you at this late date, but I finally figured out that
the execution copy that we received via this e-mail of 2-12-01 was not the
final executed version (WAS:83641.7).  The final executed version (file
WAS:83641.8) is attached.  The changes were made by Alan Larsen on January
19, 2001 to paragraphs 6.1.2 Payment Schedule (from $ 10,892,000.00 to $
11,572,250.00)and 6.1.3 Retention Letter(s) of Credit (amount changed to $
720,535).  This was due to the agreed upon scope and storage changes we
determined were necessary at time of execution to avoid a change order.

Please distribute accordingly on your side.  Also, I never received my
original signature pages, plus other consent documents.

Also, I'm trying to get our copy of the executed CA Development I and CA
Development II contract documents.  Plus the E-Next Generation contract,
too.  (Who says we're going paperless.)

Thanks,

Lee

We attach the following:

(a) a clean and blacklined copy of the ENA Consent, reflecting changes to
the credit documentation;
(b) a mark-up of the "no objection to forms" letter to be executed by ENA;
(c) a draft letter from the purchasers under the Note Purchase Agreement
setting out the actions to be taken by ENA post funding and agreeing not to
issue entitlement orders in respect of their security interest in the Escrow
Account if these actions are completed.

We would be grateful if you could confirm whether Citibank had any comments
on the Escrow Agreement, and whether the account will be set up for
Wednesday's funding.

Kind regards
Isabel

		 Subject: Issues List for LLC Documents with Panda Energy and Delta

Kay, as I told you, Carolyn put out a set of intial draft documents and we 
debriefed Jake and Stephen.  Based on our meeting, Carolyn was going to make 
certain revisions based on the answers to the questions below and certain 
other items we raised during our meeting.  Nevertheless, your input is 
required on the following:

1.  We have discussed eliminating the payment of a development fee, which if 
Delta /  Panda were to breach its obligations prior to the funding of the 
Escrow would be non-refundable and serve as a form of liquidated damages.  
Commercially the inclination is to avoid that fee, we need to confirm that 
approach.

2.  We need to interface with Dale Rasmussen on the status of the break out 
contract and how quickly it can be incorporated into the form of Facility 
Agreement that would be part of our transaction.

3.  Have we established an LLC that will be sold for this project.

4.  Please see Caroline's questions 6, 7 and 13 below.

5.  Please see faxes that I left on your chair on the broker issue and 
whether we need to respond in writing.  Sheila Tweed's position was not to.

6.  John asked whether K&S should open a separate subfile or include the time 
charged within the Blue Dog file?

Thanks and we'll talk tomorrow.

Kay:

I just spoke with Bill Blumenthal (our HSR expert).  He and Paul Hastings'
HSR expert have traded voice mails exchanging information, but have not yet
spoken.  Bill says that Delta is apparently relying on the "ordinary course"
exemption, which may be fine if all the LLC wants to do is hold turbines for
re-sale.  If the LLC works on development of a power plant, the analysis
would be different.  In any event, Bill agrees that the only safe thing to
do is provide now for the possible requirement to file later.

Prior to speaking with Bill, I also spoke with Greg Lang.  He agrees that we
should provide now for the possible requirement to file later.  He again
asserted that since this is "Enron's structure," Enron should agree to bear
50% of any filing fee.

Steve Thome indicated earlier today that Enron may be willing to bear half
of the filing fee.  Under current regulations, the filing fee will be $45k
if, at the time the put/call is exercised, the assets have a fair market
value of $50-100 million, and the filing fee will be $125k if, at the time
the put/call is exercised, the assets of the LLC have a fair market value of
$100-500 million.

Please let me know whether to advise Greg that Enron will accept
responsibility for half the filing fee.  Thank you.

NEW E-MAIL ADDRESSES AT PAUL, HASTINGS, JANOFSKY & WALKER LLP

We have changed our e-mail address.  Our new domain name is

conventional first name and last name plus @paulhastings.com.  Here are
two examples: janesmith@paulhastings.com and danjones@paulhastings.com.

==============================================================================


Per our  conversations on Friday and our discussions with our clients at 
Delta today,  attached please find a pdf file that contains a draft timeline 
for the  transaction and our comments to the Letter Agreement.
?
Please note that  many of our comments reflect?a change to the structure 
whereby the Escrow  Agent would ultimately pay out the ENA fee and the 
progress payments to GE under  the Turbine Contract on behalf of the LLC.??We 
prefer this structure  and believe it?does not alter the underlying economics 
of the deal.?  It is also our understanding that Enron has agreed to a 
financing condition  precedent to DAL's obligation to make the initial 
deposit into the Escrow  Account and our mark-up reflects this understanding.
?
Regarding the LLC  Agreement, our principal comment is to add an allowance 
for a pledge of the DAL  Membership Interest without consent in connection 
with third party financing in  Section 6.1(c) thereof.? Of course other 
changes to conform the Letter  Agreement may be needed as well.
?
We will provide  additional comments to the draft Guaranty tomorrow; however, 
we will expect that  the obligations be capped at specific dollar amount and 
that the term of the  Guaranty would end upon the earliest occurrence of any 
of the events set forth  in Section 5.3(c) of the Letter Agreement.? We will 
also need to discuss  changes to the Escrow Agreement in light of our 
comments to the Letter  Agreement.
?
In the interests of  time, we are distributing these comments?before 
our?clients have had  time to review them. As such, they remain subject to 
their further comments and  review.? Please feel free to contact John Hawkins 
or me with regard to any  of the foregoing. We look forward to discussing our 
comments with you at your  earliest convenience.

In conversations with GE, it is their understanding that their guaranty will 
not be transmitted until there is a fed ref number tomorrow.  The opinion 
letter will be faxed as soon as the GC is available, or Kent can sign for Dan 
Rowley if that is acceptable.  DRowley can sign originals on Thursday.

The LOC is in the works, and GE understands that 10% will be retained in 
escrow until the LOC is delivered.

There will be three original opinions.  There is one original guaranty, and 
I'm not certain of GE's willingness to give more than that.  Obviously, there 
will be only one LOC.

We have enclosed what we hope is the final draft of the letter agreement
between ENA and PPL, marked to reflect revisions from the prior draft dated
April 3, 2001.  In the event these revisions are acceptable, we have also
enclosed a clean copy for execution.  We would recommend execution in

I talked with Ben this afternoon and understand that we are ready to proceed 
with Panda Energy in a transaction involving the sale of member interests in 
special purpose entities associated with the four(4) LV units.  I have left a 
message with Panda letting them know that we are prepared to proceed and will 
begin preparing a set of draft definitive agreements for their review.  I 
have asked Panda to confirm that they are ready to receive these documents 
and proceed.  I understand that you are in Houston.  Please call/see me 
tomorrow morning so that we can discuss this transaction.

Kay:  We need to prepare a draft set of definitive agreements for this 
transaction.  Can Carolyn complete this while you are in New York?  Also, 
what is the status of the LM Breakout contract for the 4 LV units.  Let me 
know.

Kathleen:  We need to confirm tomorrow morning that we have received executed 
CA's from Panda.  I have the CA execution originals for the four Panda 
entities at my desk for Ben's signature.  These need to be received prior to 
sending Panda the definitive agreements.  We will fax signature pages to Ben 
tomorrow.

Chris:  See me tomorrow morning to discuss the technical spec's that were 
sent to Panda

I will be at my desk by 8 am tomorrow morning.

Kay:

The enclosed ENA Consent looks fine to me, but you may wish to run this by
Sheila Tweed, as she had a specific request on the NY court jurisdiction
language.  We initially advised Isabel Parker that Enron would accept NY
federal court jurisdiction but not jurisdiction of NY state courts.  She did
not take our comment, and Enron subsequently said it would accept
jurisdiction of commercial courts in Manhattan, but not state courts
generally (language suggested by Sheila Tweed through Carlos Sole).   Isabel
has drafted the revised version to delete reference to NY state courts
altogether and to limit the federal courts reference to those located in the
borough of Manhattan.  Please review and advise.

Tony, Rick

Our counsel has provided these drafts of the project documents.  Please 
review.  We also anticipate sending out the turbine contracts later today.

Please be advised of our timeline.  Since we need to fund escrow by Wednesday 
21 March, it is imperative that we are able to sign these documents on Friday 
16 March.  It is our assumption there will be some lag between the obligation 
to fund escrow and the actual transfer of funds.  

Your comments to these documents are expected by Friday 9 March.

I also want to mention that Enron initiated the additional purchase of Power 
System Stabilizers, which cost $31,675 per turbine.  PSS are required in the 
WSCC, but you will have to  determine whether or not your particular project 
would be required to install these in New England.  If you desire this 
optional equipment, please reflect that cost in your final bid.

Kay,

Our deal with Panda Energy involves 4 LM units.  I believe that this is the 
total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to 
talk with Lee at GE.

I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  They 
are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of 
signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.

Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is 
working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not 
yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the 
LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay 
consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is 
Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.

The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable 
to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase 
price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar 
to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing 
information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?

Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit 
for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for 
Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are 
re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at 
LV Co-Gen?

Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will 
let you know when I hear back from him.

Fred

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

Please find attached the following:
(a) a clean and blacklined copy of the GE Consent, showing the changes from
the version last circulated to you;
(b) a clean and blacklined copy of the GE legal opinion to be issued by
Daniel Rowley, reflecting the changes requested by you; and
(c) a form of letter to be signed by GE, attaching the agreed forms of the
Turbine Contract, GE Consent and GE legal opinion.

The lenders are to fund on Friday.  As they are funding into escrow without
an executed Turbine Contract or Consent from GE, the GE letter attaching the
agreed documents is a condition precedent to funding.  We would be grateful
for any comments on the letter, and if you could confirm that a signatory
will be available on Friday to sign the letter by fax.

The lenders will fund into an escrow account and the funds in that escrow
account will be released to GE when all the relevant documentation is
signed.  For that reason, we will draft and send to you for your review a
simple form of receipt to be signed by GE, acknowledging  that it has
received payment in full from the escrow account.  This receipt will be
signed when the Turbine Contract and Consent are signed, but not released
until GE has actually received its money.

I appreciate that the timing of this structure is complicated.  Please do
give me a call with any comments on the documents or with any queries
regarding timing.  My telephone number is 212 277 4025.

Kind regards
Isabel

In connection with the required Turbopark notices and documents related to 
the turbine sale to Delta, attached for your initial review and comment are 
drafts of the initial notice to CSFB, an assignment and assumption agreement 
and a bill of sale.  Three of the turbines being sold derive from the May 
2000 agreement with GE and one of the turbines being sold derives from the 
April 3, 2001 "Agreement in Principle" with GE.  Please note, if possible, we 
would prefer not to identify what amount is owed by E-Next on the turbines 
(this impacts the purchase price section in the exhibit on the initial 
notice).

Lastly, as a background refresher, ENA is effectively selling 4 turbines to 
Delta Power as follows.  ENA presently owns 100% of Salmon Energy LLC.  Delta 
is going to place in escrow the monies owed on 4 turbines (as well as ENA's 
profit on the transaction) and after such escrow deposit, ENA will then 
proceed with the submittal of the CSFB notice and execution of the assignment 
and assumption agreement and bill of sale.  After these steps have occurred, 
then ENA will sell 80% of its interest in Salmon to Delta Power.  At some 
future date, ENA's remaining 20% interest in Salmon will be transferred to 
Delta.

Thank you and please call me with any questions.

Kay, Hancock has delivered a revised letter that eliminates the language 
related to "committee approvals".  At some point today, can you provide me 
with a short matrix outlining the status of and the remaining risk related to 
completing the items in paragraph two of Hancock's letter and other such CPs 
in the Salmon Letter Agreement?  Once we have that, we should debrief Chris 
and Louise as to our view on Delta's ability to close on the purchase.

Isabel and Greg:

Attached is an escrow instruction letter authorizing you to hold the
documents referenced in the memorandum in trust until the closing
transaction.

Jaap, you are authorized to fax the documents that you have to Isabel at 212
277 4001 and to Greg at 203-359-3031.  As the funding is contingent on them
seeing our fax documents first, we will have to send them now (or no later
than 9 CST) or the funding doesn't occur.

Call me if you have any questions.

Kent

This seems fine.  You might want to add the GE acknowledgement of receipt of
funds, which, as we are holding documents in escrow until monies are
received by GE, can also now be signed in advance.
As to the opinion, we would prefer it to be executed by Dan Rowley or
yourself, rather than by you per personam Dan Rowley.
Let me know if this is possible
Thanks

Can we not fax the document to Dan Rowley and ask him to fax it back to us?
That way he doesn't need to print it out.  Alternatively, do you have
authority to issue the opinion yourself?

That is fine but if you can also fax the documents to me at the same time at
212 277 4001, that would be good.
I agree with the Escrow Letter in principle - who would you want to sign
such a letter? Presumably Salmon, as beneficiary of the guarantee?

Greg Lang at Paul Hastings has requested that the fax documents be sent to
him.  Is that okay?  I need to create an Escrow Letter that says the
documents cannot be released until funding.  I don't want a guaranty out
there without a closing.

Our credit documentation provides that Pegasus shall not cause any monies to
be released from the Turbine Escrow Account until all relevant documentation
has been executed and delivered, namely:

(i) GE consent
(ii) GE opinion
(iii) Turbine Contract
(iv) Security Agreement
(v) Promissory Note
(vi) Amended Salmon LLC Agreement
(vii) GE Parent Guarantee.

The lenders consequently expect to see an executed (faxed if necessary) copy
of all of the above (including the GE Parent Guarantee) prior to release of
funds from the Escrow Account.

Thank you
Isabel

In conversations with GE, it is their understanding that their guaranty
will not be transmitted until there is a fed ref number tomorrow.  The
opinion letter will be faxed as soon as the GC is available, or Kent can
sign for Dan Rowley if that is acceptable.  DRowley can sign originals on
Thursday.

The LOC is in the works, and GE understands that 10% will be retained in
escrow until the LOC is delivered.

There will be three original opinions.  There is one original guaranty, and
I'm not certain of GE's willingness to give more than that.  Obviously,
there will be only one LOC.

Kay:

We have attached execution copies of the following documents for execution
by ENA and/or Salmon LLC:

1.  Escrow Agreement (we will change pages to delete brackets on ENA wire
instructions and to add Pegasus wire instructions as soon as we get info
from Pegasus);
2.  ENA Letter re Forms of Agreement;
3.  Entitlement Letter Agreement;
4.  ENA Consent and Agreement;
5.  Consent of Sole Member authorizing the turbine acquisition and the
issuance of membership interests;
6.  First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (we will
fill in the dates later); and
7.  Consent of Members of LLC electing new directors, and Consent of
Directors of LLC electing new officers (we will type in names once they are
provided by Pegasus).

You should have the following documents:

1.  Schedule of Fees for Escrow Agreement; and
2.  Certificate of Incumbency;
3.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement;
4.  Bill of Sale; and
5.  Notice of Intent to Purchase Specified Option Property.

The following agreements are not yet available for signature by ENA:

1.  Escrow Disbursement Instructions (Greg says he thinks the one we
originally submitted was okay, but he wants to review again - he had put it
on hold due to the securities entitlement account issue)
2.  LLC Membership Certificates (need membership certificate books)
3.  Secretary's Certificate of LLC (waiting on revised draft from Paul
Hastings - they have promised to re-send it shortly.  If I don't get this in
an hour or so, I'll have my secretary re-type it and will forward to you.
Unfortunately, this one is the other incumbency certificate which requires a
number of signatures).

I have convinced Greg Lang that since the GE Consent and Agreement refers to
the fact that Salmon LLC has granted a security interest in the Turbine
Contract to the lenders, the GE Consent and Agreement should be executed by
Salmon after Pegasus is in control of Salmon.   Therefore, I have not
enclosed the GE Consent and Agreement in this package.

Please send over a signed copy of the Confidentiality Agreement for our
records.  If you have any questions or comments, please advise.  Thanks.

I attach the following:

(a) a clean and blacklined copy of the GE opinion, marked to show the
changes from the version circulated yesterday; and
(ii) a clean and blacklined copy of the GE Consent, marked to show the
changes from the version circulated yesterday.

The opinion has been amended to cover the parent guarantee by General
Electric Company of GE Packaged Power's obligations under the Turbine
Contract.  The Consent has a minor amendment reflecting a change to the
credit documentation.

I would be grateful if you could confirm that the changes are acceptable.

We may want to go ahead and circulate the ENA Incumbency Certificate for the
escrow.  I was holding it until the Salmon Incumbency Certificate revisions
were completed by Paul Hastings so that the two documents could be
circulated simultaneously, but I'm not sure they will get that document to
us in time to do both together.  Thanks.

Hi Catherine,

I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the 
funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.



I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a 
form for that one yet.

Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay and Carlos:

Greg Lang advises that they are targeting a financial closing with their
lenders on Thursday, April 19.  If this bears out, the escrow would be
funded three business days later, on Tuesday, April 24.  However, ENA can
terminate the letter agreement if the escrow is not funded on or before
Friday, April 20.  Therefore, PPL may (although I have not confirmed their
intent in this regard) fund the escrow immediately following their financial
closing, rather than waiting the three business days.  They are proceeding
under the assumption that an acceleration of payments to GE will be
negotiated.  If not, Plan B (the "non-disturbance" lien) requires additional
documentation with their lenders and with ENA that may result in some delay.
Resolution of this issue is obviously critical to the timetable.  Let me
know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks.

Such April 30th payment shall constitute full and final payment for the
Units, except that Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of any
and all amounts associated with any Change Order after the Effective Date.
The final payment is also subject to Section 6.1.3.

Also, Delta has suggested that we add in language for the adjustment due to
site conditions.  I added language to Exhibit A-1.

Both of these edits are from the CA form.

Kay:

The enclosed ENA Consent looks fine to me, but you may wish to run this by
Sheila Tweed, as she had a specific request on the NY court jurisdiction
language.  We initially advised Isabel Parker that Enron would accept NY
federal court jurisdiction but not jurisdiction of NY state courts.  She did
not take our comment, and Enron subsequently said it would accept
jurisdiction of commercial courts in Manhattan, but not state courts
generally (language suggested by Sheila Tweed through Carlos Sole).   Isabel
has drafted the revised version to delete reference to NY state courts
altogether and to limit the federal courts reference to those located in the
borough of Manhattan.  Please review and advise.

Kay:

We have attached execution copies of the following documents for execution
by GE:

1.  GE Letter re Forms of Agreement;
2.  GE Consent and Agreement;
3.  Legal Opinion of Counsel to GE;
4.  GE Receipt.

These documents were circulated by Isabel Parker to Kent Shoemaker, you, me
and others on April 23, 2001.

The only other document is the GE Parent Guaranty.  Greg Lang circulated
comments (in a PDF file) by an e-mail 4/18 at 5:59 p.m.   Greg asked earlier
today whether the form of this document had been agreed by GE and I could
not respond.

You should have the following documents:

1.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement; and
2.  Turbine Contract.

Several of the ENA documents are not yet finalized, so I will try to get
those to you after lunch.  Please send over the LLC certificate book in
order that we may prepare membership certificates.

If you have any questions or comments, please advise.  Thanks.

I don't believe Chris wants to sell the LV transformers, but I'll confirm.

Subject: Re: Panda Energy  

Kay,

Our deal with Panda Energy involves 4 LM units.  I believe that this is the 
total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to 
talk with Lee at GE.

I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  They 
are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of 
signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.

Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is 
working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not 
yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the 
LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay 
consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is 
Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.

The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable 
to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase 
price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar 
to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing 
information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?

Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit 
for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for 
Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are 
re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at 
LV Co-Gen?

Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will 
let you know when I hear back from him.

Fred

Subject: Re: Panda Energy  

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

I talked with Ben this afternoon and understand that we are ready to proceed 
with Panda Energy in a transaction involving the sale of member interests in 
special purpose entities associated with the four(4) LV units.  I have left a 
message with Panda letting them know that we are prepared to proceed and will 
begin preparing a set of draft definitive agreements for their review.  I 
have asked Panda to confirm that they are ready to receive these documents 
and proceed.  I understand that you are in Houston.  Please call/see me 
tomorrow morning so that we can discuss this transaction.

Kay:  We need to prepare a draft set of definitive agreements for this 
transaction.  Can Carolyn complete this while you are in New York?  Also, 
what is the status of the LM Breakout contract for the 4 LV units.  Let me 
know.

Kathleen:  We need to confirm tomorrow morning that we have received executed 
CA's from Panda.  I have the CA execution originals for the four Panda 
entities at my desk for Ben's signature.  These need to be received prior to 
sending Panda the definitive agreements.  We will fax signature pages to Ben 
tomorrow.

Chris:  See me tomorrow morning to discuss the technical spec's that were 
sent to Panda

I will be at my desk by 8 am tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Fred

Kay:

We need agreement on the escrow disbursement letter (which Delta still needs
to comment on).  Per the letter agreement, we already have agreement on the
form of Amended and Restated LLC Agreement; however, the outstanding issue
with respect to requiring unanimous member consent for sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the LLC is still on the table.

Isabel Parker called and reminded me that the ENA Consent and Agreement is
to be signed tomorrow, Friday 4/20, contemporaneously with the funding of
the escrow account, rather than upon closing.  She is happy with the letter
if we drop its references to the ENA Consent and Agreement.

I am now worried about the ability to have an escrow funded by tomorrow,
given that we still haven't let the escrow agent in on this structure.  Greg
called about an hour ago and said he was working on comments to the escrow
agreement.

Tony, Rick,

Here is a redline of the original turbine contract that I sent out.  The 
numbering has been corrected and some changes made to section 10.7.

Let me know how your review is proceeding.  Our counsel has suggested that 
you may want to make a trip to Houston to go over the contracts if you have 
substantive comments.  We would like to have executable versions by close of 
business Friday.

Steve

Kay:

Attached are copies of the Salmon promissory note to PPL and the Security
Agreement.  Greg says a Financing Statement is coming from Freshfields.
Greg asked for an ENA letter similar to the GE letter to be signed at escrow
funding agreeing to the execution of these forms at closing.  I will
duplicate the GE letter.  I'm still waiting on his and Isabel's response to
our proposal re the escrow.  Greg advises that the additional language on
the Turbine Contract should be coming shortly.

Kay:

Attached are some things that Jake will need to sign.  These are items that
were mentioned as pending in my last distribution of documents for
execution.

1.  Resolutions of Salmon (page one is the two members electing the
designated directors, and page two is the new directors electing the new
officers).  I had previously furnished this to you, but the names of the
officers to be elected were blank).

2.  Resolutions of Salmon authorizing execution of the PPL promissory note
and related security agreement and the GE consent and agreement (these were
prepared by the Paul Hastings firm).

3.  Secretary's Certificate with Incumbency (this is required by
Freshfields).

The Secretary's Certificate with Incumbency may be required today.  The
resolutions are not needed for funding but will be needed prior to closing.
If you have any questions, please call.

Carlos, I have a bunch of comments and questions on the below.  I have copied 
Herman Manis on this since he wasn't part of your distribution and I want him 
to read what the sales plan is to insure that he is comfortable with it and 
that it agrees with what the originators and legal folks have been telling 
him.

Re your email intro:  1.  The amount owed to E-Next does not need to be 
included in this Notice.  It must be included in the second notice we must 
provide to E-Next for the purchase.  We refer to it as the Prepayment 
Notice.  2.  I don't understand the flow of the sales process for this deal.  
My last understanding was that it was to be handled like the CA Development 
sale.  In that deal, my understanding is that ENA assigned its purchase 
option to CA Dev.  The sale of the LLC originally owned by ENA was sold to CA 
Dev prior to the $$ flowing to E-Next for the purchase of the equipment.  CA 
Dev put the $$ in escrow first then we issued the purchase notice.  Please 
advise if this was not the case and why ENA is the entity purchasing the 
equipment in this deal.  Has accounting and the originator agreed on the 
accounting treatment this transaction will receive based on the sale 
process/flow of $$ described below?

Notice of Intent to Purchase:  1.  Since CA Development was completed, the 
form of the Notice has been changed to be more detailed with respect to the 
underlying financing:
  This letter will serve as written notice to the Administrative Agent that 
(1) the Development and Construction Manager under the Development and 
Construction Management Agreement dated as of December 15, 2000, among E-Next 
Generation LLC, the Developer Subsidiaries from time to time parties thereto, 
and Enron North America Corp., as Development and Construction Manager (as 
such terms are define in such agreement), has designated [name of purchaser 
and state of incorpation], as its designee pursuant to Section 6.1(a) of such 
Development and Construction Management Agreement, and (2) [purchaser] 
intends to purchase the Specified Option Property listed (and as defined) in 
Exhibit 1 attached hereto.  The applicable purchase date shall be [insert 
date].

The Notice should be signed by ENA with Consent provided by Salmon Energy LLC 
as purchaser.

These documents in draft form should be approved by CSFB/Milbank prior to us 
sending the Notice.  When the Notice is sent, the execution copies of all 
documents associated with the purchase should also be sent to the appropriate 
parties.  Sending one package is the most expedient method and most likely to 
have the documents executed in the five business days that we need.  Rose 
Engeldorf can provide you with the information you need for whom to send it 
to.

Exhibit 1 to Notice to Purchase:  As noted above, item 5 can be deleted in 
this Notice.  In item 6, please spell out the parties involved in the 
Agreement in Principle as "the foregoing parties" can be interpreted to 
include WestLB as stated in the May 12, 2000 turbine purchase agreement.  As 
we all know, they are not a party to the Ag in Principle.  Also, Kay had been 
talking with Rose about perhaps changing the AIP to become a change order to 
the existing LM6000 master turbine purchase agreement.  Is this happening?  
If so, won't this change this description in every schedule to these purchase 
agreements?

Assumption & Assumption Agreement:  This Schedule 1 should mirror the 
Schedule 1 in the Bill of Sale.  In Schedule 2, please add an attention line 
to Shazia Sarker, CSFB , Phone 212 325 9935.

Bill of Sale:  In first paragraph, please correct E-Next's name.  There 
should not be a "I" at the end of it.  Also, insert "the" before the 
definition of "Developer".  Schedule 1 needs to have the same changes made as 
I discussed above under Notice of Intent to Purchase.

UCC-3s:  Not part of your package but a required document for releasing the 
equipment from E-Next to Salmon.  Rose can help you insure that these are 
created.

Please provide your comments to the above group along with the next draft of 
documents, which should probably be ready for review by CSFB/Milbank.

Subject: Turbopark Notices and Documents for Delta Turbine Sale 

In connection with the required Turbopark notices and documents related to 
the turbine sale to Delta, attached for your initial review and comment are 
drafts of the initial notice to CSFB, an assignment and assumption agreement 
and a bill of sale.  Three of the turbines being sold derive from the May 
2000 agreement with GE and one of the turbines being sold derives from the 
April 3, 2001 "Agreement in Principle" with GE.  Please note, if possible, we 
would prefer not to identify what amount is owed by E-Next on the turbines 
(this impacts the purchase price section in the exhibit on the initial 
notice).

Lastly, as a background refresher, ENA is effectively selling 4 turbines to 
Delta Power as follows.  ENA presently owns 100% of Salmon Energy LLC.  Delta 
is going to place in escrow the monies owed on 4 turbines (as well as ENA's 
profit on the transaction) and after such escrow deposit, ENA will then 
proceed with the submittal of the CSFB notice and execution of the assignment 
and assumption agreement and bill of sale.  After these steps have occurred, 
then ENA will sell 80% of its interest in Salmon to Delta Power.  At some 
future date, ENA's remaining 20% interest in Salmon will be transferred to 
Delta.

Thank you and please call me with any questions.

We have enclosed initial drafts of the closing memorandum and of a letter
from ENA confirming that it has no objection to and will not act in
furtherance of frustrating execution of the financing documents between
Salmon and PPL.  Please review and advise of any comments.

We await receipt of comments to the escrow disbursement instruction letter.

Greg and Kay:

I have enclosed clean and blacklined copies of the escrow disbursement
instruction letter, marked to reflect changes from the draft previously
circulated for signature.  The only revisions were to change the persons
named to sign this letter to be individuals who are available and who were
named as authorized on the respective incumbency certificate previously
submitted to Citibank, and to delete the bracketed information on the first
page of the letter addressing the GE letter of credit, as this is expected
to be available by fax on Wednesday.  Please ensure that the signature page
of this letter is signed and ready  to transmit to Citibank by fax upon
closing on Wednesday.

If no one has an objection, I will send a draft of this document to Estelle
Lawrence at Citibank today in order that she can be preparing to receive the
signed copy by fax tomorrow.   Thanks.

ENA and Panda Energy.  (I have also included redlined drafts marked to
reflect (i) changes to the letter agreement from the prototype form, and

advise of the following additional information in order that we may complete
the enclosed documents:

Section 3.2.1 et seq. of the LLC Agreement);
3.  Name of the new LLC formed by ENA;
4.  Date of organization of the new LLC;
5.  Purchase Price payable by Panda;
6.  Section 5(a) - there is a substantive question as to what ENA is
responsible for in connection with the Turbine Contract (I included in
brackets the alternative that was originally in the prototype document and
also the alternative as modified by Kay Mann);
7.  Outside date after which either party could terminate if transaction is
not closed;
8.   Date of confidentiality agreement;
9.  Identity of any broker used by Panda or ENA;
10.  Address for notice to Panda;
11.  Confirmation that Purchase Amount is defined in the Turbine Contract;
12.  Confirmation that Commercial Operation is defined in the Turbine
Contract; and
13.  Date of automatic right to put or call the LLC interest.

Please review the enclosed and advise of any comments.  Per your prior
e-mail, I am available for a 2:30 meeting this afternoon.  John Keffer has
confirmed his availability as well if necessary.  Please advise.  Thank you.

Steve,
I was correct in my assumptions.  Each turbine should go into four different 
LP's.  Panda West Power I, L.P., Panda West Power II, L.P., Panda West 
PowerIII, L.P. and Panda West Power IV, L.P.  Please advise if you have any 
additional questions.

Kay:

I spoke with Isabel Parker on the following issues:

1.  I requested copies of the note, security agreement and the
non-disturbance lien document.  She said they will be using a securities
account with a securities intermediary structure (UCC Article 8 concept)
rather than a non-disturbance lien.  She said they are working on these
documents and will furnish as soon as possible.

2.  I advised that the ENA consent is satisfactory.

3.  I advised of the timing issue on the GE consent, such that the GE
acknowledgement of payment needed to be prospective due to logistical
issues.  She is considering this.

4.  She requested a quick response on whether the GE letter agreement is
consistent with Enron's discussions with GE, as she needs to get this to GE
as soon as possible in order that they will be ready to sign it on Friday
4/20.  The GE letter agreement (agreeing to the form of all of the
documents) must be signed this Friday 4/20 before the lenders will advance
funds, as this letter agreement is a condition precedent to funding.  Please
advise on this issue.

I also spoke with Greg Lang and expect comments on the Escrow Agreement
within a half hour or so.  I reminded him of the need for a W-9 and an
incumbency certificate to open the escrow account.  (Estelle Lawrence has
also called looking for the escrow agreement).

Hot off the press from Lee. I don't think it will be a problem to get Lee to 
push the outside date to March 28, and to reduce the termination fee to $250k.

Gentlemen:

We have enclosed revised resolutions of Salmon Energy LLC, marked to reflect
revisions from the draft previously circulated on April 17, 2001.  Per my
prior e-mail, based on the new timing structure, ENA, as sole member, will
no longer be approving the loan from PPL, the security agreement in favor of
PPL, or the GE Consent and Agreement, all of which will now be approved and
executed by the newly elected Pegasus slate of directors and officers,
effective on the closing date.  We will leave preparation of the authorizing
resolutions for those items up to you.  Thanks.

Sent: Thursday, April 19, 2001 8:58 PM

Subject: ENA Letter


Carolyn- I discussed the issue re the ENA letter with the lenders and they
can live with the delivery of a letter attaching the forms with the "no
objection" and "no act in furtherance of frustration" language we discussed
with Kay.  We also need to make sure a mechanism in place that ensures that
upon Pegasus' payment of the $800 on the morning of the transaction closing
(post-Turbine K execution and pre-escrow release), ENA will deliver the
membership interest in Salmon and any other deliverable required to allow
the Delta/Pegasus slate of officers to be installed to execute the Salmon
Note and the Salmon Security Agreement. I suppose this can be effected in
that escrow control letter that Freshfields is drafting that ENA and the
lenders will sign.

Do you want to redraft your letter or would you prefer us to mark it up. Let
me know.

I changed your edit to Exhibit A-1 to show that we're burning natural gas,
not liquid fuel.

Other than that, looks good.
