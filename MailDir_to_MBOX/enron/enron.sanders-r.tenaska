		 Subject: Steve Tick's Restructuring Proposal

Steve Tick's PPA restructuring proposal (which we now refer to as the "ten 
points of light") is generally as follows:

The partnership agrees to amend the interest rate adjustment to capacity 
charges, which effectively lowers capacity revenue by virtue of a lower 
$/kW-mo. charge.  Per Steve, the modified adjustment should take into account 
plant capacity, use of the term vs. construction loan amount and a 1.00 vs. 
1.25 coverage ratio.  Steve also advocates that the loan balance be reduced 
for the development fee collected by Tenaska at close; I wouldn't go there, 
as Steve has told me on a number of occasions that Brazos doesn't know about 
this fee.

The partnership agrees to change how the capacity rate is applied (he 
advocates charging the new capacity rate on 240 MW and charging 50% of the 
new capacity rate on the next 23 MW), which effectively lowers capacity 
revenue by virtue of fewer billing determinants.

Steve's view is that items 1 and 2 need to amount to at least $3.5 MM in 
savings to Brazos per year; more is better, >$5.0 MM is a slam dunk

The effects of items 1 and 2 are mitigated by (a) collecting a higher 
capacity rate for some period of time after 2019 and (2) adjusting energy 
rates through 2006 to recapture marginal energy losses.  Steve's advice on 
these point is that we shouldn't be pigs.  As I think you know, our exposure 
on point (b) is greatest when the plant runs at higher levels of capacity, 
which causes us to consume more than 45,000 Dth/day without adequate 
compensation through the PPA.

Brazos purchases the development site for $x (he likes to use $15 MM, which I 
think is a stretch).  Steve understands that we have a $7.5 MM termination 
payment obligation back to the original Tenaska IV partners to the extent we 
wish to convey the development assets, but believes Tenaska, Inc. would be 
willing to assume all or a portion of this commitment in exchange for an 
agreement w/Brazos that totally eliminates its officers' liability on fraud.  
Steve appears to believe this risk is real, or he wouldn't make such a big 
deal out of it.  He points to the use of the 1.25 coverage assumption in the 
interest rate adjustment as clear evidence that Brazos made decisions based 
on an assumption that the Tenaska partners would earn only a reasonable 
risk-adjusted return on this project.  Even Merrill Lynch, Brazos' financial 
advisor, bought off on this provision of the agreement.  Steve is willing to 
go to bat with both Brazos and Tenaska on this point to see this to 
resolution.  To the extent he's successful and we receive, for example, $10 
MM for the development assets, this would be an immediate offset to the 
capacity payment reductions set out under items 1 and 2.

The partnership converts the facility to EWG and, per Steve, shares the 
benefits with Brazos.  My view is that this could just as easily be done by 
adjusting the heat rates used for tolling purposes (i.e., after 2006 and, to 
the extent applied in the energy pricing used to address his item 3, through 
2006).

The partnership removes distilled water equipment and sells it in the 
market.  Steve thinks proceeds realized from the sale should be (a) shared 
(up to 100%) with Brazos or (b) used to purchase replacement blades that 
could be installed during the May outage to prevent summer downtime 
(obviously, timing is a key issue here).

Brazos is granted the right to further reduce its contract payment 
obligations in ways that are similar to its Apache demand charge buy-out.  
This is a Steve Tick soap-box item; he uses it as an opportunity to remind 
Brazos that other value has been created during the facilitation process.

Steve speaks to project-level debt restructuring, and suggests that Brazos be 
granted the right to affect this restructuring within parameters that are set 
by the partnership.  I don't know what to do with this, but to say that I 
believe there is value to restructuring debt at the project-level with 
existing lenders in a way that leaves existing swaps in place.  Inasmuch as 
we have always planned to take on structurally subordinated debt obligations, 
there is borrowing capacity at the project level.  Since we would need to go 
to the banks for consents on any of the PPA/structural changes advocated by 
Steve, it would appear to make sense to tackle debt restructuring on the same 
pass.  The banks would love a solution that puts the disputes to rest and 
should be willing to both consent and lend against the cash flow of the 
restructured project.  CoBank, who has $70 MM of the project debt (which 
amortizes beginning in 2012), is one of the banks in the total return swap 
with KBC by virtue of syndication.

Steve also advocates what he refers to as "equitable adjustments".  In 
effect, he would establish a market index against which the all-in PPA price 
could be compared, and would have Brazos pay a premium over it's PPA price to 
the extent the market price floats above the PPA price.  I think this is an 
interesting concept, but we can't count on value here.  More importantly, I'm 
not aware of a transparent enough price to make this work in ERCOT.

Finally, Steve advocates turning management of the project over to Brazos in 
return for a "hell or high water" commitment on capacity payments.

Steve's view is that the "hell or high water" commitment, together with the 
settlement itself, makes PPE's partnership interests more marketable.  I'm 
not sure we agree with his view of the risks relative to the overall 
liquidity of our interests.  However, we need to recognize that he's working 
with substantially more information than we are at this point from the 
perspective of what he knows about Brazos' side of the case.

My reaction is that there are things we can work with in Steve's proposal.  
Chris and I are looking at the pricing/cost offset details more closely, and 
should have something to discuss shortly.

Dan, sorry I missed you yesterday.  Let me know when you'd like to place the 
call to Tom Moore to update him on the current activity.  Also, do you have a 
sense yet for who we'll be working with on this internally?

Happy Trails...

Rick

There are some factual assertions in Brazos' memo that caught my eye.  I
wondered what information we have on these points:

1) at the bottom of p. 2 is a reference to a March 10, 1994 memo in which
someone claimed Tenaska planned to develop this site irrespective of Brazos.
The suggestion is that Tenaska would have an adequate remedy by selling
power elsewhere.  What is our reaction to that?

2) at the bottom of p. 5 is an assertion that we must be predicting that the
difference between market and contract prices will increase over time.  Is
that our position?  If we apply a contract v. market measure, I know we seek
to base the contract portion on the escalated contract prices, but what do
we use for market?  (Their piece of course does not address what is the
market.)

3)  in the middle of p. 6 is the claim that representations were made to
Brazos that Tenaska would earn a modest profit under the PPA.  Do we know
what that refers to?

4) at the bottom of p. 6 is a statement that under present market conditions
Brazos cannot even exercise this buyout option (presumably because its
payments under the PPA do not cause Brazos to be non-competitive).  That is
interesting.  If so, what is Brazos's complaint?

5) at the bottom of p. 7 is a claim that the option period was designed as
an alternative to Brazos's owning the plant at the end of the primary term.
What do we know about that?   What would be the effect of the pricing in the
renewal term?

1. Rick,  are you the person to prepare the schedule?

2. It is not  readily apparent to me that we necessarily should feel under 
any obligation to"show cause" that we are not in default , although a civil 
non-inflammatory reequest to discuss the issue would probably have been well 
received..it seems to me that if we grovel now in a defensive and reactive 
manner it keeps them with the initiative (Q. Do we really think they are 
prepared to throw the dice and declare the default?)  

3.  How much was paid for the interests is none of their  #$@%& business. 

4. What Limited Waiver Agreement?  Did I get a copy? I can't find it in my 
email.

		 Subject: Brazos' October 20 letter



As agreed, I spoke with Clifton. He explained his  letter to me. I told him 
that I was under the impression that the issue over the  transfer documents 
was resolved in favor of a schedule. He said that he was not  aware of that. 
When I asked him point blank whether Brazos was declaring a  default, he 
referred me to Pat Long. 
?
I just got off the phone with Pat. I asked Pat if  the letter was a "default 
letter" or?a letter in the nature of "an order to  show cause why Brazos 
should not declare Tenaska in default".? He answered  that it was the latter. 
I also asked him if my recollection of how the transfer  document issue has 
been resolved was correct and he confirmed that it was.  Hence, you only need 
to produce a schedule showing who owns Tenaska and its  partners and what 
options exist to acquire ownership or additional ownership  interests in 
Tenaska and its partners. As Dan  thought that Rick would be the one to 
prepare the schedule, he asked me to send  a copy of this email to Rick. 
?
For your information, they would like to know how  much the new players paid 
for the interests in Tenaska.
?
Pat also said that?the Limited Waiver  Agreement that I sent out this morning 
was fine with him but that Phil had two  minor changes that I would receive 
tomorrow. Hence, please respond to that  document tomorrow so we can get that 
out of the way.
?
Finally, as some of you know, tomorrow I will be  sending out a draft of what 
I hope will become an agreed upon statement of the  issues that need to be 
resolved in order to properly analyze the damage issue. I  would appreciate a 
rapid turn-around on that document.
?
While I am in Houston, I would like to meet with  Carl and Rick. If you two 
are available, we could meet for diner on the night on  the 9th. The purpose 
of the meeting is to make sure that I understand the  options available to 
Brazos.

I agreed to report to you after my meeting with  Brazos on where things 
stand. Such is the purpose of this email.
?
Unfortunately, all I can tell you at this point is  that Brazos is 
considering its options and deciding on?its best course of  action. 
?
Insofar as timing is concerned,?I do not  anticipate hearing from them until 
after Thanksgiving. In the interim, I do not  recommend that you attempt to 
contact Brazos or its counsel.
?
One of the subjects that we covered at the meeting  was the results of the 
legal analysis on the damage issue. In that  regard,?I would like to thank 
Karl and Tom for getting me the information  I?requested. I was able to work 
that information into the meeting. I did  not, however, hear from any of you 
on incidental or consequential damages. If  you?think that you will have 
those damages, you should let me know. I will  forward that information to 
Brazos and its counsel.
?
In the interim, I plan on calling Rick one or two  more times to make sure 
that I fully understand all of the numbers. The part of  the meeting dealing 
with the numbers was very illuminating for Brazos and its  counsel, and I 
would like to?thank Carl and Rick for all of their effort.  That should not, 
however,?be interpreted as a sign that Brazos will accept  your proposal. 
?
If I don't speak to you before the holiday, I want  to wish all of you a good 
holiday.

Mark:

Thanks for meeting with us last week to discuss the Pan Nat Transaction.   I 
think we have a strong legal position, however, I hope we can avoid 
arbitration and reach agreement with Duke.  As I mentioned we will be meeting 
with John Sickman next Wednesday at 9:00 (without lawyers).   This meeting 
will be the last commercial discussion before we exchange our "Initial 
Positions" on the 21st of Nov as part of the arbitration process.

A call from you on Monday will assist in framing the meeting  
(713-627-5515).  Specifically, can you relay the following to John:

1. As Duke called the meeting, we are interested in hearing their proposals 
on the revised purchase price.  We do not intend to debate the interpretation 
of the contract (does the price cap apply, Force Majeure, Loss of Supply, 
etc.).

2. We have give then numerous counterproposals in the past and do not see 
this as a meeting where they ask us to go away and develop a revised proposal 
on shipping, etc..   We are open to hearing their specific proposals.

3. We wish to resolve the situation expediently and we plan to continue with 
the agreed schedule to exchange Initial Positions on the 21st of November.

4. Our side will be represented by decision makers.  We trust that they will 
come to the meeting with the same level of commitment and authority - please 
ask him who will represent Duke at the meeting.

Again, thanks for your help - good luck with the call.   I will be out of the 
office on Monday and Tuesday, but Jeff Hodge, Richard Sanders and/or Eric 
Boyt can assist you with any details.

Regards,
Brian

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

I spoke with Deutsche bank immediately after my conversation with Dan Lyons.  
I apologize as I must not have communicated clearly that I understood the 
importance of this issue from a legal point of view.  My intent on having 
language proposed was not to concede to any proposed language by Deustche but 
to determine if it was possible to be assured of bringing in a significant 
commitment to the syndication of the transaction as well as not create any 
potential legal issues.  As this was not the case, I told Deutche that after 
reviewing their proposed documentation, we could not make the change and that 
they should come into the transaction and hold the entire $35MM amount and 
hold that amount rather than syndicating it out the back end as initially 
contemplated.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL  ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION


KBC is apparently having trouble syndicating the Cornhusker deal and one of 
the potential syndicees, Deutsche Bank, didn't like the way our deal was 
structured thinking it wasn't as good a deal for the banks as a different 
Enron deal they were in.  I think at least some of us have talked about this 
before and I am reluctant, given the posture of Brazos at the current moment 
to do even de minimis or seemingly non- controversial or harmless changes to 
the documents because I don't know how it might be construed or twisted 
against us in  a litigation scenario..having said that, I think this one does 
two things..it gives DB a right to step in and act onits own behalf if Enron 
doesn't pay...this seems to me to be a clear change from a hardly maintained 
position that we wanted to deal with one entity, not a dozen and in my view 
is a change in the deal, but I guess is your call..the second change (I 
think) adds some ability on the part of the banks to involve ponderosa in 
remedial actions if there is non-payment...this seems to me to have the 
advantage of reinforcing Ponderosa's status as an owner, but may not reflect 
our deal with Ponderosa and to some extent is inconsistent with the Mantra we 
have consistently had of Enron's credit being the credit which was being 
bought...I note that I have made these observations from my memory of what 
the docs say and request Lebouef to confirm my analysis or correct it...at 
any rate if my analysis is correct I vote no, but I think we probably need a 
group discussion early next week as they want to finalize the assignments on 
Tuesday...Lebouef will be sending a separate memo about some other issues 
that have been raised by the proposed assignments...it seems to me that our 
original deal is being steadily chipped away and I really worry about it in 
light of the strained relations with Brazos

Brian, as we discussed attached is the proposed language
to be added to the Assignment Agreement to address the DB policy issue.
Also, the language will facilitate the loan saleability and therefore 
included in the Assignment
Agreement when we sell the loan.  As indicated in the note our counsel is 
reviewing the
Assignment Agreement which we just recently received from Mayer, Brown.

After  you and your counsel have reviewed the language below please give me a 
call.

We (Mike Gough, plant manager, Mike Mazowita and various Westinghouse "SWPC" 
commercial folks) have had a few lengthy discussions concerning the February, 
April and August outages.  The current issues and their status is as follows:

Outstanding Invoices:  The Feb and April invoices total to $1,627,541.81.  
The breakdown is 2 times $420,388.06 Labor and $786,765.69 Parts.  We have 
analysed the Parts invoices and have determined that the calculation 
correctly (or favourably in some cases) determines the correct useful life 
charge.

Tenaska Invoice Dispute:  Tenaska asserted that they should not be required 
to pay either the parts or the labor for these outages (and would have held 
similar for the August outage).  The parts which were the source of the 
failure, the transition pieces and seals (including allocable labor), were 
noted on the invoices as "Warranty."  The invoices were for the "actually 
used life" for the repaired/replaced components as well as the incremental 
labor associated with replacing these components.  Tenaska believes the 
incremental should be covered under consequential damages under either the 
warranty provisions of the maintenance agreement or the individually signed 
labor agreements.  SWPC contends that there is no consequential damage 
concept in either agreement.

Temporary resolution as of today:  We have agreed with SWPC to pay all parts 
life charges and hold aside the labor charge in escrow pending legal review.  
The review and either concurrence with SWPC or Tenaska needs to be reached 
immediately.  I would like Richard Sanders of legal to spearhead this review 
and deliver a preliminary view by cob tomorrow.  We will execute some form of 
escrow and or payment depending upon Richard's determination.

Power Systems root cause analysis:  We will have PS at the site during next 
weeks outage and will be required to pay for 1 full 8 hours of shift 
downtime.  Once we know the legal review from 3 above, I will inform SWPC of 
this issue.  The plant personnel already know and will fully cooperate.

At this time, I would not expect that we have a potential disclosure issue on 
the invoices (certainly open to change).

Further to the information feedback provided to you below:

Item 3.

I've updated page 2 of the attached to illustrate pricing that was presented 
to Brazos and its advisor (Merril Lynch) during the period of time leading up 
to the PPA's signing on November 1, 1993.  You'll see that actual results to 
date have been in line with were costs were expected to be under the contract.

We have a one page document that appears to be part of a larger Brazos 
document that indicates that Brazos looked at 10 competing alternatives to 
the Tenaska IV plant (including one Enron alternative).  The document is 
date-stamped December 28, 1993 and may be part of an "integrated resource 
plan" or another regulatory filing required in the State of Texas.  Robin 
Kittel in our Austin, TX office is looking into its source and is trying to 
find any other regulatory filings in which Brazos represented that it viewed 
Tenaska IV as its "least cost alternative" at the point in time it entered 
into the contract.  I don't expect we'll have this information prior to 
Friday.

These points aside, there is nothing in the contract that ties pricing or 
performance to returns realized by Tenaska IV.  The issue of "fairness" is 
one that Brazos seems to be emotionally attached to without basis under the 
contract.

One item to note in the "fraudulent inducement" arena, the last commercial 
exchanges made between Tenaska IV and Brazos prior to the June 30 transaction 
indicate that Brazos may have raised some concerns over "incentives" that may 
have been provided to the Brazos staff closest to the transaction.  After 
discussions with Tenaska, Inc. and review of the facilitation material, we've 
identified the source of these concerns to be a dove hunting trip that was 
planned during the summer of 1993 and taken November 9 through 11, 1993, just 
after the PPA's signing.  The point person for Brazos and Tenaska's CEO, lead 
developer and another Tenaska employee took the trip with their spouses.

Subject: BRAZOS - PREPARED AT THE REQUEST OF COUNSEL

Some initial reactions to your questions...

The implied enterprise value at June 30 based on PPE/ENA's net purchase price 
and outstanding project-level debt was $1,457/kW; this value reflects 
fully-contracted cash flow under the terms of the existing PPA.  As a pure 
merchant plant, the value might range from $50/kW (i.e., the "scrap value" 
based on a view that the margins realized from running the plant are 
insufficient to warrant keeping the doors open) to $350/kW (based on a view 
that the plant runs 7x24 and achieves prices at levels forecasted by Pace 
Global Energy (Pace) in a study that we had completed to facilitate 
commercial discussions with Brazos earlier this year).

The attached slide will give you a feel for where PPA prices are relative to 
market prices, again using Pace's numbers to illustrate "market".  ENA's 
ERCOT 7x24 curve is probably higher at the front end and lower on the back 
end than what we see from Pace, reflecting (1) at the front end, what we're 
seeing in today's gas forward markets (i.e., higher prices than Pace predicts 
from an "econometrics" point of view) and (2) at the back end, lower overall 
inflation.  In general, I think it's safe to say that we see the spread 
between PPA and market prices widening, especially in light of the fact that 
current gas market conditions narrow the spread considerably during the 
period of time in which a Brazos breach is most likely.

Based on the facilitation material we've seen, it appears that Brazos will 
argue that its staff was lead to believe that Tenaska IV would earn no more 
than 20% return on equity.  However, we've always viewed this as a somewhat 
disingenuous line of argument because Brazos has gone on public record as 
saying that it looked at a number of competing solutions to meet its members' 
needs and chose the least cost alternative in contracting with Tenaska IV.  
In fact, the all-in price projections we've seen in correspondence between 
Tenaska IV and Brazos in the contracting process appear to be in line with 
actual results.  To the extent the project has earned a return in excess of 
20%, this can generally be attributed to the cost savings realized in 
construction and strict enforcement of the contract.  It's also important to 
note that Tenaska IV took on all of the development risk in this project; it 
could have easily underbudgeted costs and found itself earning significantly 
less.

See the historical perspective that follows the forward projections contained 
in the attached.  We generally agree that Brazos has not been harmed by the 
current contract to date, but is in an above-market contract on a going 
forward basis.

Brazos appears to have three options at the end of the primary term (1) walk 
away, (2) purchase the plant for PV5 of future capacity payments, or (3) live 
with the contract by paying scheduled contract prices (i.e., capacity charges 
and gas agency fees) plus operating costs.  If Brazos selects options (2) or 
(3), Tenaska IV has certain "put-back" rights, but the plant is generally 
Brazos' for the taking.  These provisions of the PPA should yield prices that 
are below prevailing market prices in most years (i.e., other than those in 
which major maintenance will occur) as illustrated in the attached.  
Accordingly, we view the contract as more of an "accelerated payment plant" 
that front end loads capital recovery to Tenaska IV.  Patton Boggs' argument 
puts a new "spin" on the contract structure, one that we've not heard up to 
this point.

		 Subject: Brazos


There are some factual assertions in Brazos' memo that caught my eye.  I
wondered what information we have on these points:

1) at the bottom of p. 2 is a reference to a March 10, 1994 memo in which
someone claimed Tenaska planned to develop this site irrespective of Brazos.
The suggestion is that Tenaska would have an adequate remedy by selling
power elsewhere.  What is our reaction to that?

2) at the bottom of p. 5 is an assertion that we must be predicting that the
difference between market and contract prices will increase over time.  Is
that our position?  If we apply a contract v. market measure, I know we seek
to base the contract portion on the escalated contract prices, but what do
we use for market?  (Their piece of course does not address what is the
market.)

3)  in the middle of p. 6 is the claim that representations were made to
Brazos that Tenaska would earn a modest profit under the PPA.  Do we know
what that refers to?

4) at the bottom of p. 6 is a statement that under present market conditions
Brazos cannot even exercise this buyout option (presumably because its
payments under the PPA do not cause Brazos to be non-competitive).  That is
interesting.  If so, what is Brazos's complaint?

5) at the bottom of p. 7 is a claim that the option period was designed as
an alternative to Brazos's owning the plant at the end of the primary term.
What do we know about that?   What would be the effect of the pricing in the
renewal term?

At Tom Moore's request, I've removed the debt value from the column labeled 
"UCC Damages" in the attached, reflecting the fact the its the owners' 
responsibility to settle its debt obligations after receiving the damages 
award.

Hi Tom:

You may know this already, but Angela Davis in our legal group is now 
handling matters pertaining to Cornhusker instead of Dan Lyons.  She asked me 
to update you on where we are and send along two documents that need your 
review prior to them being sent to Brazos.

As you know, Chuck Ward and I have met w/Brazos on three occasions (twice in 
Waco in once by phone) since your meeting with them in Dallas on December 
21.  The purpose of those meetings was to further reinforce the point made by 
you and Carl Tricoli that, as equity sellers, PPE/ENA values the Cleburne 
asset based on its future cash flow with no discount for risks associated 
with litigation.

Five developments are of significance since the last time you and I spoke:

It became apparent to us during our meeting on March 16 that Brazos may have 
problems funding an acquisition at any price.  Specifically, Brazos is 
considering a number of capital projects aimed at securing long-term power 
commitments to fill short positions associated with the Southern arrangement 
rolling off in 2003.  Based on their experience w/the Cleburne, TX facility, 
Brazos appears to be committed to controlling their own destiny, and might 
find it much easier to fund marginal projects with an all-in cost (or 
collateral value) that is closer to market.

Primarily as a result of point 1, Brazos has asked us to look at the 
possibility of PPA restructuring vs. acquisition.

Also in conjunction with point 1, Brazos has been working with a number of 
potential energy suppliers to secure long-term power commitments.  It appears 
to us that they are preparing to sign some form of commitment next week.

Clifton Karnei sent a letter to Chuck Ward and Steve Tick on March 29 
outlining expectations for a conference call that took place yesterday.  The 
letter, which was actually received after the conference call, will be faxed 
to you this afternoon.  Attached is a draft response along with a 
presentation that outlines the manner in which the partnership could 
restructure the PPA.  Steve, while he has not seen the letter, is of the 
opinion that it's Brazos' turn to speak; we may not need the letter, but it 
reinforces a number of points and sets up a restructuring in such a way that 
we might like to send it along.   

We are giving a great deal of thought to the notion that a third party might 
be willing (and able) to pay considerably more for this asset than Brazos 
given its PPA, gas market conditions, and dispatch profile.  Specifically:

Southern (having realized the PPA has embedded in it an in-the-money call 
option on gas) has recently begun to "reverse toll" the plant by turning it 
back during off-peak hours when the net cost of replacement energy (i.e., the 
absolute price of market power less penalties paid under the PPA for heat 
rate degradation on energy taken from the plant plus gas market value) 
warrants economic dispatch.

This asset commands a control premium from anyone that might be engaged (or 
about to engage) in a long-term, full requirements contract with Brazos.

There are tax benefits associated with this asset that could be effectively 
monetized in a transfer of interests.

Obviously, we would face the same obstacles that Tenaska faced in selling the 
asset.

Please give me a call when you get a chance.

Regards,

Rick Hill

You'll love this.  

While a strict interpretation of the PPA may get you there (i.e., Monthly 
Availability = Delivered Energy / [MIN(Requested Energy,Contract Energy)]), 
I'm not sure how this would play out under "force majeure" circumstances.  In 
any event, isn't it great that we have a "contract employee" that's taken the 
time to read the PPA and figure this out!

Subject: Tenaska IV Availability


A thought has occurred to me regarding the PPA and I would like for you to
provide a reality check. As you know for the first time ever, Brazos has
elected to purchase gas supplies which would have been used in our plant had
we been capable. Per section 9.05(b) of the PPA, "if the Utility requests
less than the contract energy for such gas day, the Utility may elect to
purchase gas supplies from the Company on such gas day under the relevant
gas supply contracts less the volumes used by the Company to satisfy the
Utility's generation request for such gas day". On both the daily and
monthly (Nov) nomination sheets we fill out our generation capabilities and
send it to Brazos and they intern complete and send back to us. Typically in
the past when we are down (other than the annual scheduled maintenance
outage) Brazos always requests contract generation which effects the monthly
availability calculation (PPA definition is delivered energy/requested
energy). The nominations we are now getting back from Brazos is 0 requested
for generation and 45,000 mmbtu for gas. It would seem to me that if  Brazos
is requesting to utilize all of the gas supply and no requested generation
then they can't have it both ways and our availability would not be impacted
(i.e. plant availability would be 100%). This may be splitting hairs but I
thought it might be worth further examination.

Attached is a preliminary draft of a memorandum on the Brazos damages issue. 
As was the case with the QF issue, I think that Brazos' position is not at 
all strong.

The memorandum needs to be authority checked and polished a little, but I 
believe that the conclusion is sound. Section 11.02 of the PPA is likely to 
be enforced as will the contract escalation provisions. We should discuss how 
much of all of this we should share with Tick.

Dan, could I get you to distribute the memorandum as appropriate? Thanks.

Thanks for bringing me up to speed. My only comment on the letter is that 
instead of saying that we are not "compelled" to accept a litigation 
discount, it would be more direct to say that we see no reason to take a 
litigation discount and further discussions premised on the risk of 
litigation will not be fruitful.

I am not sure I fully understand some of the points in the presentation 
materials. If you want to discuss them, please call. (Although whether I 
understand them may not be the point.)

   arrangement rolling off in 2003.  Based on their experience w/the
   Cleburne, TX facility, Brazos appears to be committed to controlling
   their own destiny, and might find it much easier to fund marginal
   projects with an all-in cost (or collateral value) that is closer to
   market.

   Primarily as a result of point 1, Brazos has asked us to look at the
   possibility of PPA restructuring vs. acquisition.

   Also in conjunction with point 1, Brazos has been working with a number
   of potential energy suppliers to secure long-term power commitments.  It
   appears to us that they are preparing to sign some form of commitment
   next week.

   Clifton Karnei sent a letter to Chuck Ward and Steve Tick on March 29
   outlining expectations for a conference call that took place yesterday.
   The letter, which was actually received after the conference call, will
   be faxed to you this afternoon.  Attached is a draft response along with
   a presentation that outlines the manner in which the partnership could
   restructure the PPA.  Steve, while he has not seen the letter, is of the
   opinion that it's Brazos' turn to speak; we may not need the letter, but
   it reinforces a number of points and sets up a restructuring in such a
   way that we might like to send it along.

   We are giving a great deal of thought to the notion that a third party
   might be willing (and able) to pay considerably more for this asset than
   Brazos given its PPA, gas market conditions, and dispatch profile.
   Specifically:

        Southern (having realized the PPA has embedded in it an
        in-the-money call option on gas) has recently begun to "reverse
        toll" the plant by turning it back during off-peak hours when the
        net cost of replacement energy (i.e., the absolute price of market
        power less penalties paid under the PPA for heat rate degradation
        on energy taken from the plant plus gas market value) warrants
        economic dispatch.

        This asset commands a control premium from anyone that might be
        engaged (or about to engage) in a long-term, full requirements
        contract with Brazos.

        There are tax benefits associated with this asset that could be
        effectively monetized in a transfer of interests.

   Obviously, we would face the same obstacles that Tenaska faced in
   selling the asset.

Please give me a call when you get a chance.

Regards,

Rick Hill

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL  ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION


KBC is apparently having trouble syndicating the Cornhusker deal and one of 
the potential syndicees, Deutsche Bank, didn't like the way our deal was 
structured thinking it wasn't as good a deal for the banks as a different 
Enron deal they were in.  I think at least some of us have talked about this 
before and I am reluctant, given the posture of Brazos at the current moment 
to do even de minimis or seemingly non- controversial or harmless changes to 
the documents because I don't know how it might be construed or twisted 
against us in  a litigation scenario..having said that, I think this one does 
two things..it gives DB a right to step in and act onits own behalf if Enron 
doesn't pay...this seems to me to be a clear change from a hardly maintained 
position that we wanted to deal with one entity, not a dozen and in my view 
is a change in the deal, but I guess is your call..the second change (I 
think) adds some ability on the part of the banks to involve ponderosa in 
remedial actions if there is non-payment...this seems to me to have the 
advantage of reinforcing Ponderosa's status as an owner, but may not reflect 
our deal with Ponderosa and to some extent is inconsistent with the Mantra we 
have consistently had of Enron's credit being the credit which was being 
bought...I note that I have made these observations from my memory of what 
the docs say and request Lebouef to confirm my analysis or correct it...at 
any rate if my analysis is correct I vote no, but I think we probably need a 
group discussion early next week as they want to finalize the assignments on 
Tuesday...Lebouef will be sending a separate memo about some other issues 
that have been raised by the proposed assignments...it seems to me that our 
original deal is being steadily chipped away and I really worry about it in 
light of the strained relations with Brazos

Some initial reactions to your questions...

The implied enterprise value at June 30 based on PPE/ENA's net purchase price 
and outstanding project-level debt was $1,457/kW; this value reflects 
fully-contracted cash flow under the terms of the existing PPA.  As a pure 
merchant plant, the value might range from $50/kW (i.e., the "scrap value" 
based on a view that the margins realized from running the plant are 
insufficient to warrant keeping the doors open) to $350/kW (based on a view 
that the plant runs 7x24 and achieves prices at levels forecasted by Pace 
Global Energy (Pace) in a study that we had completed to facilitate 
commercial discussions with Brazos earlier this year).

The attached slide will give you a feel for where PPA prices are relative to 
market prices, again using Pace's numbers to illustrate "market".  ENA's 
ERCOT 7x24 curve is probably higher at the front end and lower on the back 
end than what we see from Pace, reflecting (1) at the front end, what we're 
seeing in today's gas forward markets (i.e., higher prices than Pace predicts 
from an "econometrics" point of view) and (2) at the back end, lower overall 
inflation.  In general, I think it's safe to say that we see the spread 
between PPA and market prices widening, especially in light of the fact that 
current gas market conditions narrow the spread considerably during the 
period of time in which a Brazos breach is most likely.

Based on the facilitation material we've seen, it appears that Brazos will 
argue that its staff was lead to believe that Tenaska IV would earn no more 
than 20% return on equity.  However, we've always viewed this as a somewhat 
disingenuous line of argument because Brazos has gone on public record as 
saying that it looked at a number of competing solutions to meet its members' 
needs and chose the least cost alternative in contracting with Tenaska IV.  
In fact, the all-in price projections we've seen in correspondence between 
Tenaska IV and Brazos in the contracting process appear to be in line with 
actual results.  To the extent the project has earned a return in excess of 
20%, this can generally be attributed to the cost savings realized in 
construction and strict enforcement of the contract.  It's also important to 
note that Tenaska IV took on all of the development risk in this project; it 
could have easily underbudgeted costs and found itself earning significantly 
less.

See the historical perspective that follows the forward projections contained 
in the attached.  We generally agree that Brazos has not been harmed by the 
current contract to date, but is in an above-market contract on a going 
forward basis.

Brazos appears to have three options at the end of the primary term (1) walk 
away, (2) purchase the plant for PV5 of future capacity payments, or (3) live 
with the contract by paying scheduled contract prices (i.e., capacity charges 
and gas agency fees) plus operating costs.  If Brazos selects options (2) or 
(3), Tenaska IV has certain "put-back" rights, but the plant is generally 
Brazos' for the taking.  These provisions of the PPA should yield prices that 
are below prevailing market prices in most years (i.e., other than those in 
which major maintenance will occur) as illustrated in the attached.  
Accordingly, we view the contract as more of an "accelerated payment plant" 
that front end loads capital recovery to Tenaska IV.  Patton Boggs' argument 
puts a new "spin" on the contract structure, one that we've not heard up to 
this point.

		 Subject: Brazos


There are some factual assertions in Brazos' memo that caught my eye.  I
wondered what information we have on these points:

1) at the bottom of p. 2 is a reference to a March 10, 1994 memo in which
someone claimed Tenaska planned to develop this site irrespective of Brazos.
The suggestion is that Tenaska would have an adequate remedy by selling
power elsewhere.  What is our reaction to that?

2) at the bottom of p. 5 is an assertion that we must be predicting that the
difference between market and contract prices will increase over time.  Is
that our position?  If we apply a contract v. market measure, I know we seek
to base the contract portion on the escalated contract prices, but what do
we use for market?  (Their piece of course does not address what is the
market.)

3)  in the middle of p. 6 is the claim that representations were made to
Brazos that Tenaska would earn a modest profit under the PPA.  Do we know
what that refers to?

4) at the bottom of p. 6 is a statement that under present market conditions
Brazos cannot even exercise this buyout option (presumably because its
payments under the PPA do not cause Brazos to be non-competitive).  That is
interesting.  If so, what is Brazos's complaint?

5) at the bottom of p. 7 is a claim that the option period was designed as
an alternative to Brazos's owning the plant at the end of the primary term.
What do we know about that?   What would be the effect of the pricing in the
renewal term?

I agree on continuing to use the thin seal if row 1 blades are the root cause.

I spoke with various SWPC folks today and yesterday.  We should be receiving 
a comprehensive schedule by the end of the week with item detail and timing 
for the outage.  I mentioned that the lack of regular notification of the 
outage repair schedule was unacceptable.  We'll see.  I also mentioned that 
Brazos sent us a letter that was headed towards a "fit for usage" issue in 
the PPA and that ENA would look through any assertion to that as a SWPC 
problem.  Additionally, I mentioned that a CEO-level meeting was scheduled 
for next week to discuss the technical issues of various projects in the 
portfolio and that the SWPC situation (Tenaska and our delayed delivery) were 
item 1 on the agenda.  I also passed to SWPC that we bust the 65% before we 
bust the 80% test and that accordingly, a December finish is unacceptable.  
Fudges just a little, buit its frankly none of their business what the real 
date is.  I also reminded them that they owe me a fixed-price labor proposal 
by the end of the week.

Back  in the office on Friday.

Richard Sanders is now examining the SPC Maintenance Agreement and the 
individual labor agreements re our warranty view.  We should have a quick 
view by tomorrow cob.  If we feel that these invoices are our full 
responsibility and correctly due and payable, we shuld re-examine the 
purchase and sale agreement w/ Tenaska and determine whether we believe a 
faulty disclosure was made or whether we should eat it.

As for the parts, I'm looking to James Armstrong to determine whether there 
are any accounting, spare parts on order, or other irregularities for which 
we should hold back on settling the working capital.

We might have a difficulty holding back upon the working capital true-up if 
the disclosure is unresolved or we don't have a clear view shortly.

Chuck

I received a call from Jerry Krouse (Tenaska's Controller) re. the June 30 
financials sent to us on August 30 and the $402,253 working capital 
settlement due the former owners under the terms of the Purchase Agreement.  
I told him that we were looking at several items and verifying our 
understanding of the amounts due.  Three questions:  (1) are we still of the 
opinion that we should hold off on the working capital settlement pending a 
clear course of action on the Westinghouse matters and, if so, (2) where are 
we on the Westinghouse matters and (3) what should we be telling Tenaska?

Richard,

Have you had the opportunity to reach a legal determination as to Tenaska 
IV's rights under the Maintenance Agreement and/or Service Agreements.  I 
need to respond to SWPC today.

Thank you,

Rick, it actually looks OK to me, but I forwarded it on to Richard Sanders 
and you shoul probably get his input...

Attached is a?proposed agreement reflecting  Brazos limited waiver of its 
right to object to V&E participating in the  Facilitation. Please review it 
with your respective groups and get back to me  with any comments you may 
have.
?
Shortly, I will be sending you a first draft of  what I hope will be an 
agreed-upon list of issues that need to be resolved in  order to effectively 
address the damage question. 
?
Tom, I don't know if Carl has had a chance to let  you know that Brazos would 
like to change the date of the meeting of counsel to  either?November 9 or 
10. Could you please find out if one of those dates  meets with your group's 
approval? The meeting will be in Houston. 
?
Pat, if you haven't already done so, you need to  send a copy of your memo on 
damages to Tom.

Did you have a chance to continue developing your view on this issue so as to 
give me some legal direction (I note that my prior guidance wasn't 
illegal!).  I'd like to call SWPC tomorrow morning with a response/view/plan 
of action on this matter.  If we need, let's get a third-party litigator on 
this.  Thanks,  Chuck
